Financial climate risk: a review of recent advances and key challenges,2024-04-10T20:17:43Z,Victor Cardenas,"The document provides an overview of financial climate risks. It delves into
how climate change impacts the global financial system, distinguishing between
physical risks (such as extreme weather events) and transition risks (stemming
from policy changes and economic transitions towards low carbon technologies).
The paper underlines the complexity of accurately defining financial climate
risk, citing the integration of climate science with financial risk analysis as
a significant challenge. The paper highlights the pivotal role of microfinance
institutions (MFIs) in addressing financial climate risk, especially for
populations vulnerable to climate change. The document emphasizes the
importance of updating risk management practices within MFIs to explicitly
include climate risk assessments and suggests leveraging technology to improve
these practices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07331v1
"Indexing and Visualization of Climate Change Narratives Using BERT and
  Causal Extraction",2024-08-03T11:05:41Z,"Hiroki Sakaji, Noriyasu Kaneda","In this study, we propose a methodology to extract, index, and visualize
``climate change narratives'' (stories about the connection between causal and
consequential events related to climate change). We use two natural language
processing methods, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) and causal extraction, to textually analyze newspaper articles on
climate change to extract ``climate change narratives.'' The novelty of the
methodology could extract and quantify the causal relationships assumed by the
newspaper's writers. Looking at the extracted climate change narratives over
time, we find that since 2018, an increasing number of narratives suggest the
impact of the development of climate change policy discussion and the
implementation of climate change-related policies on corporate behaviors,
macroeconomics, and price dynamics. We also observed the recent emergence of
narratives focusing on the linkages between climate change-related policies and
monetary policy. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the negative
impacts of natural disasters (e.g., abnormal weather and severe floods) related
to climate change on economic activities, and this issue might be perceived as
a new challenge for companies and governments. The methodology of this study is
expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, as it can analyze causal
relationships among various economic topics, including analysis of inflation
expectation or monetary policy communication strategy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01745v1

  Climate Information on Charitable Donations to Climate Activism",2024-09-25T21:45:13Z,"Samantha Gonsalves Wetherell, Anna Josephson","We examine the propensity of individuals to donate to climate activism,
evaluating the impact of different informational treatments on an incentive
compatible charitable donation and stated climate change-related concerns.
Participants were evaluated on climate literacy and general climate attitudes
before being randomly assigned to a treatment which provided either education
or neutral language about climate change, either with or without images of
protest. After the treatment, participants engaged in an incentive compatible
dictator game. We find that participants gave more to climate activism than
seen in previous dictator game and charitable giving experiments, in both
average amount given and proportion of participants who gave their entire
endowment. However, we determine that climate activism information negatively
influenced the amount of money donated. We also found that protest imagery
moderated this negative effect and had a positive significant effect of
increasing participants' climate concern. Finally, we found that the climate
concern was significantly positively correlated with donations, while being a
male was significantly negatively associated with donation amounts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17378v1
"Climate Impact Assessment Requires Weighting: Introducing the Weighted
  Climate Dataset",2024-12-20T09:18:22Z,"Marco Gortan, Lorenzo Testa, Giorgio Fagiolo, Francesco Lamperti","High-resolution gridded climate data are readily available from multiple
sources, yet climate research and decision-making increasingly require country
and region-specific climate information weighted by socio-economic factors.
Moreover, the current landscape of disparate data sources and inconsistent
weighting methodologies exacerbates the reproducibility crisis and undermines
scientific integrity. To address these issues, we have developed a globally
comprehensive dataset at both country (GADM0) and region (GADM1) levels,
encompassing various climate indicators (precipitation, temperature, SPEI, wind
gust). Our methodology involves weighting gridded climate data by population
density, night-time light intensity, cropland area, and concurrent population
count -- all proxies for socio-economic activity -- before aggregation. We
process data from multiple sources, offering daily, monthly, and annual climate
variables spanning from 1900 to 2023. A unified framework streamlines our
preprocessing steps, and rigorous validation against leading climate impact

solution. In this study, we address this gap by developing a two-step
hierarchical model, the Augmented CARDS model, specifically designed for
detecting contrarian climate claims on Twitter. Furthermore, we apply the
Augmented CARDS model to five million climate-themed tweets over a six-month
period in 2022. We find that over half of contrarian climate claims on Twitter

climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science.
Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to
represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial
uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation
schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback,
continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the
performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for
temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE)
imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL
approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms
performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving
more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based
parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving
accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this

A Run on Fossil Fuel? Climate Change and Transition Risk,2024-10-01T17:45:48Z,Michael Barnett,"I study the dynamic, general equilibrium implications of
climate-change-linked transition risk on macroeconomic outcomes and asset
prices. Climate-change-linked expectations of fossil fuel restrictions can
produce a ``run on fossil fuels'' with accelerated production and decreasing
spot prices, or a ``reverse run'' with restrained production and increased spot
prices. The response depends on the expected economic consequences of the
anticipated transition shock, and existing climate policies. Fossil fuel firm
prices decrease in each case. I use a novel empirical measure of innovations in
climate-related transition risk likelihood to show that dynamic empirical
responses are consistent with a ``run on fossil fuel.''",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00902v1

"Incorporating climate change effects into the European power system
  adequacy assessment using a post-processing method",2024-02-26T21:44:36Z,"Inès Harang, Fabian Heymann, Laurens P. Stoop","The demand-supply balance of electricity systems is fundamentally linked to
climate conditions. In light of this, the present study aims to model the
effect of climate change on the European electricity system, specifically on
its long-term reliability. A resource adequate power system -- a system where
electricity supply covers demand -- is sensitive to generation capacity, demand
patterns, and the network structure and capacity. Climate change is foreseen to
affect each of these components.
  In this analysis, we focused on two drivers of power system adequacy: the
impact of temperature variations on electricity demand, and of water inflows
changes on hydro generation. Using a post-processing approach, based on results
found in the literature, the inputs of a large-scale electricity market model
covering the European region were modified. The results show that climate
change may decrease total LOLE (Loss of Load Expectation) hours in Europe by
more than 50%, as demand will largely decrease because of a higher temperatures
during winter. We found that the climate change impact on demand tends to
decrease LOLE values, while the climate change effects on hydrological
conditions tend to increase LOLE values.
  The study is built on a limited amount of open-source data and can flexibly
incorporate various sets of assumptions. Outcomes also show the current
difficulties to reliably model the effects of climate change on power system
adequacy. Overall, our presented method displays the relevance of climate
change effects in electricity network studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17039v2

(US) over the last three decades, having a significant impact on air quality

subsequent smoke exposure is challenging, as both natural variability and
anthropogenic climate change play important roles. Here we devise an approach
involving observed meteorology and vegetation and a range of models to
determine the relative roles of anthropogenic climate change and natural
variability in driving burned area across the western US. We also examine the
influence of anthropogenic climate change on smoke exposure. We estimate that
anthropogenic climate change accounts for 33-82% of observed total burned area,
depending on the ecoregion, yielding 65% of total fire emissions on average
across the western US from 1992 to 2020. In all ecoregions except Mediterranean
California, anthropogenic climate change contributes to a greater percentage of
burned area in lightning-caused wildfires than in human-caused wildfires. On
average, anthropogenic climate change contributes 49% to smoke PM2.5
concentrations in the western US from 1997 to 2020, and explains 58% of the
increasing trend in smoke PM2.5 from 2010 to 2020. We further find that
populations in northern California, western Oregon, Washington, and parts of
Idaho have experienced the greatest smoke exposure attributable to
anthropogenic climate change in recent years. Our work highlights the
significant role of anthropogenic climate change in degrading air quality in
the western US and identifies those regions most vulnerable to wildfire smoke

parameterizations that crudely but efficiently approximate these processes are
a leading source of uncertainty in long-term projected warming and
precipitation patterns. Machine Learning (ML)-based parameterizations have long
been hailed as a promising alternative with the potential to yield higher
accuracy at a fraction of the cost of more explicit simulations. However, these
ML variants are often unpredictably unstable and inaccurate in \textit{coupled}
testing (i.e. in a downstream hybrid simulation task where they are dynamically
interacting with the large-scale climate model). These issues are exacerbated
in out-of-distribution climates. Certain design decisions such as
``climate-invariant"" feature transformation for moisture inputs, input vector
expansion, and temporal history incorporation have been shown to improve
coupled performance, but they may be insufficient for coupled
out-of-distribution generalization. If feature selection and transformations

coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has

power generation capacity of renewable energy under the influence of climate
change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However,
due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often
lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and
uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a
super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance
the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty.
The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that
generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling
mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value
using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic

conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation
reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under
two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM
outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate
data. For the Ejina region, under a high-emission pathway, the annual
utilization hours of wind power are projected to decrease by 2.82 hours/year,
while those for PV power are projected to decrease by 0.26 hours/year.

with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxides (CO2). In such conditions, the
planetary climate and habitability are determined by the distribution of CO2
between exchangeable reservoirs, that is the atmosphere, ice caps, and
regolith. This produces unique responses of the Martian CO2-driven climate
system to variations of astronomical forcings. Specifically, it has been shown
that the phenomenon called an atmospheric collapse occurs when the axial
obliquity is low, affecting the Martian climatic evolution. However, the
behavior of the Martian climate system and the accompanying changes in climate
and habitability of such planets remain ambiguous. Here we employed a
latitudinally-resolved Martian energy balance model and assessed the possible
climate on Mars for wider ranges of orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and
total exchangeable CO2 mass. We show that the atmospheric collapse occurs when
the obliquity is below ~10 degrees when other parameters are kept at the
present Mars condition. We also show that the climate solutions on Mars depend
on orbital parameters, solar luminosity, and the total exchangeable CO2 mass.
We found that the atmospheric collapse would have occurred repeatedly in the
history of Mars following the variation of the axial obliquity, while the
long-term evolution of atmospheric pCO2 is also affected by the changes in the
total exchangeable CO2 mass in Martian history. Even considering the broad

"Save the Farms: Nonlinear Impact of Climate Change on Banks'
  Agricultural Lending",2024-09-28T21:53:01Z,Teng Liu,"The agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of climate
change. In this paper, I investigate how vulnerability to climate change
affects U.S. farms' credit access, and demonstrates that such impact is
unequally distributed across farms. I first construct a theoretical framework
of bank lending to farms faced with climate risks, and the model helps
discipline ensuing empirical analyses that use novel panel datasets at county
and at bank levels. I find that higher exposure to climate change, measured by
temperature anomaly, reduces bank lending to farms. Such impact is persistent,
nonlinear, and heterogeneous. Small and medium farms almost always experience
loss of loan access. In comparison, large farms see less severe credit
contraction, and in some cases may even see improvement in funding. While small
banks carry the burden of continuing to lend to small farms, their limited
market share cannot compensate for the reduction of lending from medium and
large banks. These results suggest that factors such as farm size and bank type
can amplify the financial impact of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19463v1

"Amplified Summer Wind Stilling and Land Warming Compound Energy Risks in
  Northern Midlatitudes",2024-05-30T17:48:24Z,Gan Zhang,"Wind energy plays a critical role in mitigating climate change and meeting
growing energy demands. However, the long-term impacts of anthropogenic warming
on wind resources, particularly their seasonal variations and potential
compounding risks, remain understudied. Here we analyze large-ensemble climate
simulations in high-emission scenarios to assess the projected changes in
near-surface wind speed and their broader implications. Our analyses show
robust wind changes including a decrease of wind speed (i.e., stilling) up to
~15% during the summer months in Northern Midlatitudes. This stilling is linked
to amplified warming of the midlatitude land and the overlying troposphere.
Despite regional and model uncertainties, robust signals of warming-induced
wind stilling will likely emerge from natural climate variations in the late
21st century of the high-emission scenarios. Importantly, the summertime wind
stilling coincides with a projected surge in cooling demand, and their
compounding may disrupt the energy supply-demand balance earlier. These

transformational progress in the last 1-2 years, with state-of-the-art ones now
outperforming the best physics-based models for a wide range of skill scores.
Given the strong links between weather and climate modelling, this raises the
question whether machine learning models could also revolutionize climate
science, for example by informing mitigation and adaptation to climate change
or to generate larger ensembles for more robust uncertainty estimates. Here, we
show that current state-of-the-art machine learning models trained for weather
forecasting in present-day climate produce skillful forecasts across different
climate states corresponding to pre-industrial, present-day, and future 2.9K
warmer climates. This indicates that the dynamics shaping the weather on short
timescales may not differ fundamentally in a changing climate. It also
demonstrates out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the machine
learning models that are a critical prerequisite for climate applications.
Nonetheless, two of the models show a global-mean cold bias in the forecasts
for the future warmer climate state, i.e. they drift towards the colder
present-day climate they have been trained for. A similar result is obtained
for the pre-industrial case where two out of three models show a warming. We
discuss possible remedies for these biases and analyze their spatial
distribution, revealing complex warming and cooling patterns that are partly

evaluate the impact of this coupling on productivity and waste generation. In
this work, we present a novel methodology for modeling and assessing the
resilience of coupled natural-industrial ecosystems under climate change

liquid time-constant (LTC) neural networks as surrogate models to capture
complex, nonlinear dynamics of coupled agricultural and industrial systems. The
approach is demonstrated through a case study of a soybean-based biodiesel
production network in Champaign County, Illinois. LTC models are trained to
capture dynamics of nodes and are then coupled and driven by statistically
downscaled climate projections for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2006-2096.
The framework enables rapid simulation of system-wide material flow dynamics

reveal non-linear behaviors and potential tipping points in system resilience
under different climate scenarios and farm sizes. The RCP 8.5 scenario led to
earlier and more frequent production failures, increased reliance on imports
for smaller farms, and complex patterns of waste accumulation and stock levels.
The methodology provides valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and
adaptive capacities, offering decision support for enhancing the resilience and

Conditional multi-step attribution for climate forcings,2024-09-02T17:55:52Z,"Christopher R. Wentland, Michael Weylandt, Laura P. Swiler, Thomas S. Ehrmann, Diana Bull","Attribution of climate impacts to a source forcing is critical to
understanding, communicating, and addressing the effects of human influence on

fingerprinting, have been successfully applied to long-term, widespread effects
such as global surface temperature warming, they often struggle in low
signal-to-noise regimes, typical of short-term climate forcings or climate
variables which are loosely related to the forcing. Single-step approaches,
which directly relate a source forcing and final impact, are unable to utilize
additional climate information to improve attribution certainty. To address
this shortcoming, this paper presents a novel multi-step attribution approach
which is capable of analyzing multiple variables conditionally. A connected
series of climate effects are treated as dependent, and relationships found in
intermediary steps of a causal pathway are leveraged to better characterize the
forcing impact. This enables attribution of the forcing level responsible for
the observed impacts, while equivalent single-step approaches fail. Utilizing a
scalar feature describing the forcing impact, simple forcing response models,
and a conditional Bayesian formulation, this method can incorporate several
causal pathways to identify the correct forcing magnitude. As an exemplar of a
short-term, high-variance forcing, we demonstrate this method for the 1991
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Results indicate that including stratospheric and

comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to
predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction
of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a
target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two
prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning
framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models
(VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our
results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance
between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the
distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the
context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data
correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the
prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting
highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that
machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic
elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data
observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of
climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061v1
"Impacts and risks of ""realistic"" global warming projections for the 21st
  century",2024-01-10T11:02:17Z,Nicola Scafetta,"The IPCC AR6 assessment of the impacts and risks associated with projected
climate changes for the 21st century is both alarming and ambiguous. According
to computer projections, the global surface may warm from 1.3 to 8.0 {\deg}C by
2100, depending on the global climate model (GCM) and the shared socioeconomic
pathway (SSP) scenario used for the simulations. However a substantial number
of CMIP6 GCMs run ""too hot"" because they appear to be too sensitive to
radiative forcing, and that the high/extreme emission scenarios SSP3-7.0 and
SSP5-8.5 must be rejected because judged to be ""unlikely"" and ""highly
unlikely"", respectively. This paper examines the impacts and risks of
""realistic"" climate change projections for the 21st century generated by
assessing the theoretical models and integrating them with the existing
empirical knowledge on global warming and the various natural cycles of climate
change that have been recorded by a variety of scientists and historians. This
is achieved by combining the ""realistic"" SSP2-4.5 scenario and empirically
optimized climate modeling. The obtained climate projections show that the
expected global surface warming for the 21st century will likely be mild, that
is, no more than 2.5-3.0 {\deg}C and, on average, likely below the 2.0 {\deg}C
threshold. This should allow for the mitigation and management of the most
dangerous climate-change-related hazards through appropriate low-cost
adaptation policies. In conclusion, enforcing expensive decarbonization and
net-zero emission scenarios, such as SSP1-2.6, is not required because the
Paris Agreement temperature target of keeping global warming below 2 {\deg}C
throughout the 21st century should be compatible also with moderate and
pragmatic shared socioeconomic pathways such as the SSP2-4.5.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08674v1
Granger causal inference for climate change attribution,2024-08-13T18:55:07Z,"Mark D. Risser, Mohammed Ombadi, Michael F. Wehner","Climate change detection and attribution (D&A) is concerned with determining
the extent to which anthropogenic activities have influenced specific aspects
of the global climate system. D&A fits within the broader field of causal
inference, the collection of statistical methods that identify cause and effect
relationships. There are a wide variety of methods for making attribution
statements, each of which require different types of input data and focus on
different types of weather and climate events and each of which are conditional
to varying extents. Some methods are based on Pearl causality while others
leverage Granger causality, and the causal framing provides important context
for how the resulting attribution conclusion should be interpreted. However,
while Granger-causal attribution analyses have become more common, there is no
clear statement of their strengths and weaknesses and no clear consensus on
where and when Granger-causal perspectives are appropriate. In this prospective
paper, we provide a formal definition for Granger-based approaches to trend and
event attribution and a clear comparison with more traditional methods for
assessing the human influence on extreme weather and climate events. Broadly
speaking, Granger-causal attribution statements can be constructed quickly from
observations and do not require computationally-intesive dynamical experiments.
These analyses also enable rapid attribution, which is useful in the aftermath
of a severe weather event, and provide multiple lines of evidence for
anthropogenic climate change when paired with Pearl-causal attribution.
Confidence in attribution statements is increased when different methodologies
arrive at similar conclusions. Moving forward, we encourage the D&A community
to embrace hybrid approaches to climate change attribution that leverage the
strengths of both Granger and Pearl causality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16004v1
The Economics of Climate Adaptation: An Assessment,2024-11-25T19:57:14Z,"Anna Josephson, Rodrigo Guerra Su, Greg Collins, Katharine Jacobs","The cost of the impacts of climate change have already proven to be larger

literature on the economic case for climate adaptation, with the objective of
assessing the value (economic and otherwise) of climate change adaptation, as
well as the strength of the methods and evidence that have been used to date.
We find that skepticism is warranted about many of the estimates about costs
and benefits of climate adaptation and their underlying assumptions, due to a
range of complexities associated with (1) uncertainty in distinguishing the
economic impacts of climate change from seasonal variability; (2) difficulties
in non-market valuation; (3) lack of consistent data collection over time at
multiple scales; and (4) distributional inequities in access to proactive
adaptation and recovery funding. While useful for broad stroke advocacy
purposes, these estimates fall short of the refinement and rigor needed to
inform investment decision-making, particularly at micro and local scales. Most
estimates rely on cost benefit analysis and do not effectively address these
issues. An emergent and promising literature tackles alternative estimation
strategies and attempts to address some of them, including the complexities of

initial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model
(hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection of
equilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels of
CO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios with
CO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training.
  ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sample
and out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergent
time-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change with
CO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile of
atmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates up to the
99.9999th percentile closely agree with the reference model.
Non-equilibrium-climate inference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing
gradually at a rate of 2% year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the
global annual mean trends of surface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but
produces unphysical jumps in stratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling
of CO$_2$, ML-controlled fields transition unrealistically quickly to the
4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing so they violate global energy conservation and
exhibit unphysical sensitivities of and surface and top of atmosphere radiative

development of a quantitative, causal understanding of why people approach
activism. In this work, we develop a comprehensive causal model of how and why
Reddit users engage with activist communities driving mass climate protests

data (2016 to 2022) to jointly model the roles of sociodemographic makeup,
experience of extreme weather events, exposure to climate-related news, and
social influence through online interactions. We find that among users

simulations were completed using different driving data. On the first hand, a
recent present (1980-2017) simulation driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis was
carried out to evaluate the suitability of the RCM performance. On the other
hand, two global climate models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 initiative, the CCSM4 and

the results pointed out the WRF model as a valuable tool to study the
spatiotemporal patterns of the SFCEVP in the IP, showing an overall and
acceptable ability at different spatial and temporal scales. Concerning
projections, the results indicate that the IP is likely to undergo significant
changes in the SFCEVP in the near future. These changes will be more apparent
over the southernmost, and particularly during spring and summer, being in the
latter season the SFCEVP fundamentally reduced. These results agree with

self-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not
consider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively
dis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive
advantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the
greatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact
of climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a

aforementioned radiatively active processes. The CLRF can then be decomposed
into forcing-response mode pairs which are in turn used to construct a
reduced-order model (ROM) describing the dominant dynamics of climate

"Impacts of Climate Change on Mortality: An extrapolation of temperature
  effects based on time series data in France",2024-06-04T07:37:31Z,"Quentin Guibert, Gaëlle Pincemin, Frédéric Planchet","Most contemporary mortality models rely on extrapolating trends or past
events. However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate
change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected
mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a
stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting
mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or
insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to
disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate
models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional
mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data
stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing
climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains
and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality
induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk
factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical
differences across the Metropolitan France.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02054v3

The future of offshore wind power production: wake and climate impacts,2024-08-27T11:10:37Z,"Simon C Warder, Matthew D Piggott","Rapid deployment of offshore wind is expected within the coming decades to
help meet climate goals. With offshore wind turbine lifetimes of 25-30 years,
and new offshore leases spanning 60 years, it is vital to consider long-term
changes in potential wind power resource at the farm planning stage. Such
changes may arise from multiple sources, including climate change, and
increasing wake-induced power losses. In this work, we investigate and compare
these two sources of long-term change in wind power, for a case study
consisting of 21 wind farms within the German Bight. Consistent with previous
studies, we find a small but significant reduction in wind resource due to
climate change by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission RCP8.5
scenario, compared with a historical period, with a mean power reduction (over
an ensemble of seven climate models) of 2.1%. To assess the impact of
wake-induced losses due to increasingly dense farm build-out, we model wakes
within the German Bight region using an engineering wake model, under various
stages of (planned) build-out corresponding to the years 2010-2027. By
identifying clusters of wind farms, we decompose wake effects into long-range
(inter-cluster), medium-range (intra-cluster) and short-range (intra-farm)
effects. Inter-cluster wake-induced losses increase from 0 for the 2010
scenario to 2.5% for the 2027 scenario, with intra-cluster losses also
increasing from 0 to 4.3%. Intra-farm losses are relatively constant, at around
13%. While the evolution of wake effects therefore outweighs the climate
effect, and impacts over a shorter timescale, both factors are significant. We
also find evidence of an interaction between the climate and wake effects. Both
climate change and evolving wake effects must therefore be considered within

Process models account for dormancy stages and various phenology drivers, while

simulate the Earth's climate system. ESMs provide a framework to integrate
various physical systems, but their output is bound by the enormous
computational resources required for running and archiving higher-resolution

policies to enact impactful change. Decisions in this domain are incredibly
complex, involving conflicting entities and evidence. In the last decades,
policymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide
some of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such
methods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to
forecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for
their recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.
Traditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have
several shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty.
Recent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the
traditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and
noisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL
agents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of
socio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of

terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon
introducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward
functions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached. Modelling competition

"Capturing Climatic Variability: Using Deep Learning for Stochastic
  Downscaling",2024-05-31T03:04:10Z,"Kiri Daust, Adam Monahan","Adapting to the changing climate requires accurate local climate information,
a computationally challenging problem. Recent studies have used Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of deep learning, to learn complex
distributions and downscale climate variables efficiently. Capturing
variability while downscaling is crucial for estimating uncertainty and
characterising extreme events - critical information for climate adaptation.
Since downscaling is an undetermined problem, many fine-scale states are
physically consistent with the coarse-resolution state. To quantify this
ill-posed problem, downscaling techniques should be stochastic, able to sample
realisations from a high-resolution distribution conditioned on low-resolution
input. Previous stochastic downscaling attempts have found substantial
underdispersion, with models failing to represent the full distribution. We
propose approaches to improve the stochastic calibration of GANs in three ways:
a) injecting noise inside the network, b) adjusting the training process to
explicitly account for the stochasticity, and c) using a probabilistic loss
metric. We tested our models first on a synthetic dataset with known
distributional properties, and then on a realistic downscaling scenario,
predicting high-resolution wind components from low-resolution climate
covariates. Injecting noise, on its own, substantially improved the quality of
conditional and full distributions in tests with synthetic data, but performed
less well for wind field downscaling, where models remained underdispersed. For
wind downscaling, we found that adjusting the training method and including the
probabilistic loss improved calibration. The best model, with all three
changes, showed much improved skill at capturing the full variability of the
high-resolution distribution and thus at characterising extremes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02587v1

  Projections using Deep Learning",2024-11-27T22:55:48Z,"Reetam Majumder, Shiqi Fang, A. Sankarasubramanian, Emily C. Hector, Brian J. Reich","Global Climate Models (GCMs) are numerical models that simulate complex
physical processes within the Earth's climate system and are essential for
understanding and predicting climate change. However, GCMs suffer from systemic
biases due to simplifications made to the underlying physical processes. GCM
output therefore needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for future
climate projections. Most common bias correction methods, however, cannot
preserve spatial, temporal, or inter-variable dependencies. We propose a new
semi-parametric conditional density estimation (SPCDE) for density correction
of the joint distribution of daily precipitation and maximum temperature data
obtained from gridded GCM spatial fields. The Vecchia approximation is employed
to preserve dependencies in the observed field during the density correction
process, which is carried out using semi-parametric quantile regression. The
ability to calibrate joint distributions of GCM projections has potential
advantages not only in estimating extremes, but also in better estimating
compound hazards, like heat waves and drought, under potential climate change.
Illustration on historical data from 1951-2014 over two 5x5 spatial grids in
the US indicate that SPCDE can preserve key marginal and joint distribution
properties of precipitation and maximum temperature, and predictions obtained
using SPCDE are better calibrated compared to predictions using asynchronous

contribute to accelerated climate change. As wildfires are also affected by
climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although
they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities,
lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and
account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing
computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to
predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific
regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In
this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and
predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves
classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating
with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a
wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation.
Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in
lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on
this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models
using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings
highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and

first map global offshore ambient wind resource from reanalysis data. We
estimate wake-induced losses using an engineering wake model, revealing that
locations with low (high) resource typically experience larger (smaller)
percentage losses. However, we further find that the specific wind speed
distribution is important, with narrower distributions generally leading to
greater losses. This is due to the overlap between the wind speed distribution
and the high-sensitivity region of the turbine thrust and power curves.
Broadly, this leads to much stronger wake-induced losses in the tropics (which
experience the trade winds) than mid-latitudes. However, the tropics also
experience a narrower wind direction distribution; our results demonstrate that
this leads to greater potential for mitigation of wake effects via layout
optimisation. Finally, we assess projected changes in wind resource and wake
losses due to climate change under a high-emission scenario. Many regions are
projected to decrease in ambient wind resources, and furthermore these regions
will typically experience greater wake-induced losses, exacerbating the climate
impact. These results highlight the different challenges and opportunities

Mapping climate change awareness through spatial hierarchical clustering,2024-09-16T12:03:25Z,"Gianpaolo Zammarchi, Paolo Maranzano","Climate change is a critical issue that will be in the political agenda for
the next decades. While it is important for this topic to be discussed at
higher levels, it is also of paramount importance that the populations became
aware of the problem. As different countries may face more or less severe
repercussions, it is also useful to understand the degree of awareness of
specific populations. In this paper, we present a geographically-informed
hierarchical clustering analysis aimed at identify groups of countries with a
similar level of climate change awareness. We employ a Ward-like clustering
algorithm that combines information pertaining climate change awareness,
socio-economic factors, climate-related characteristics of different countries,

clustering hyperparameters, we propose a customized algorithm that takes into
account the within-clusters homogeneity, the between-clusters separation and
that explicitly compares the geographically-informed and non-geographical

provides more stability of the partitions and leads to interpretable and

change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km
remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which
need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a
major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate
projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from
computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great
promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of
interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations
result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient
supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to
physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible
computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key
features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently,
the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show
empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as

interception, lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration, and controlling net
radiation and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes. This
influence propagates through the atmosphere, from microclimate scales to the
entire atmospheric boundary layer, subsequently impacting large-scale
circulation and the global transport of heat and moisture. Understanding the

organisations, identifying and assessing climate-related risks is challenging,
as they can come from multiple sources. This study identifies and assesses the
main climate transition risks in the colombian processed food sector. As
transition risks are vague, our approach uses Fuzzy Logic and compares it to
various multi-criteria decision-making methods to classify the different
climate transition risks an organisation may be exposed to. This approach
allows us to use linguistic expressions for risk analysis and to better
describe risks and their consequences. The results show that the risks ranked
as the most critical for this organisation in their order were price volatility
and raw materials availability, the change to less carbon-intensive production
or consumption patterns, the increase in carbon taxes and technological change,
and the associated development or implementation costs. These risks show a
critical risk level, which implies that they are the most significant risks for
the organisation in the case study. These results highlight the importance of

"Feedback Processes causing an AMOC Collapse in the Community Earth
  System Model",2024-10-04T09:00:22Z,"Elian Vanderborght, René M. van Westen, Henk A. Dijkstra","The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is recognized as a
tipping element within the global climate system. Central to its tipping
behavior is the salt-advection feedback mechanism, which has been extensively
studied in box models and models of intermediate complexity. However, in
contemporary, highly complex climate models, the importance and functioning of
this feedback mechanism is less clear due to the intricate interplay of
numerous ocean-atmosphere-sea ice feedbacks. In this study, we conduct a
detailed mechanistic analysis of an AMOC collapse under quasi-equilibrium
forcing conditions using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). By
reconstructing the AMOC strength from the meridional density contrast across
the Atlantic Ocean, we demonstrate that AMOC stability can be related to the
Atlantic freshwater budget, revealing several important feedbacks. The dominant
contribution is the destabilising salt-advection feedback, which is quantified
through a negative sign of the overturning freshwater transport at
34$^{\circ}$S, indicated by $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$. Other feedbacks are related to
changes in North Atlantic sea-ice melt (destabilising), ocean-atmosphere
freshwater fluxes (destabilising) and gyre transports (stabilising). Our study
clarifies the role of $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ as an indicator of the background
state stability of the AMOC. As many modern climate models have a positive
$F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ bias this implies that their AMOC is too stable which leads
to an underestimation of the risk of an AMOC collapse under climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03236v1

  records",2024-04-21T05:53:27Z,Ian R. Edmonds,"Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked
and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal
strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for
variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral
content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as
resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year
period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible
with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is
frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on
an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the
Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar
cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which
is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed
spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has
been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible
to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single
frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year
period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely
with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate
variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal
spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method
to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate
records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar
cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and
assessing the Sun climate connection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13542v1

Generative Adversarial Models for Extreme Geospatial Downscaling,2024-02-21T18:25:04Z,"Guiye Li, Guofeng Cao","Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and
high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather
variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded
outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general
circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due
to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand.
Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images
and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper
describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that
can accommodates very high scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods,
the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very
low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the
uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in
existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of
plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result.
These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model
uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind
velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the
framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to $64\times$)

dominant land cover types (evergreen forest, shrubs, and grassland) in the
Pacific Northwest region. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
data, we estimated vegetation recovery by calculating the incremental enhanced
vegetation index (EVI) change during post-fire years. A machine learning
technique, random forest (RF), was employed to map relationships between the
input features (elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, temperature, burn
severity, and years after fire) and the target (incremental EVI recovery) for
each land cover type. Variable importance analysis and partial dependence plots
were generated to understand the influence of individual features. The observed
and predicted incremental EVI values showed good matches, with R2 values of
0.99 for training and between 0.89 and 0.945 for testing. The study found that
climate variables, specifically precipitation and temperature, were the most
important features overall, while elevation played the most significant role
among the topographic factors. Partial dependence plots revealed that lower
precipitation tended to cause a reduction in vegetation recovery for varying
temperature ranges across land cover types. These findings can aid in
developing targeted strategies for post-wildfire forest management, considering

episodes during which the long eccentricity cycle is very weak or absent and
Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable

amplitude modulation (frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide

language models that synthesize interdisciplinary research on climate change.
We trained two 7B models from scratch on a science-oriented dataset of 300B
tokens. For the first model, the 4.2B domain-specific tokens were included
during pre-training and the second was adapted to the climate domain after
pre-training. Additionally, ClimateGPT-7B, 13B and 70B are continuously
pre-trained from Llama~2 on a domain-specific dataset of 4.2B tokens. Each
model is instruction fine-tuned on a high-quality and human-generated
domain-specific dataset that has been created in close cooperation with climate
scientists. To reduce the number of hallucinations, we optimize the model for
retrieval augmentation and propose a hierarchical retrieval strategy. To
increase the accessibility of our model to non-English speakers, we propose to
make use of cascaded machine translation and show that this approach can
perform comparably to natively multilingual models while being easier to scale
to a large number of languages. Further, to address the intrinsic
interdisciplinary aspect of climate change we consider different research
perspectives. Therefore, the model can produce in-depth answers focusing on
different perspectives in addition to an overall answer. We propose a suite of
automatic climate-specific benchmarks to evaluate LLMs. On these benchmarks,
ClimateGPT-7B performs on par with the ten times larger Llama-2-70B Chat model

between dry and wet climates, the Iberian Peninsula (IP). With this purpose,
the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, driven CCSM4 and MPI-ESM-LR
GCMs previously bias-corrected, was used. Simulations were carried out for two
periods, 1980-2014 and 2071-2100, and under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The analysis
focused on changes in land-surface processes, their causes, and the potential
impact on the climate system. To achieve this, seasonal projected changes of
land-surface (soil moisture and surface evapotranspiration) and atmospheric
variables involved in the hydrologic (precipitation and runoff) and energy
balance (temperature and solar incoming radiation) were investigated. The
results reveal that the IP is likely to experience a soil dryness by the end of
the 21st century, particularly during summer and fall, more apparent in the
southern IP, and stronger under the RCP8.5. However, such trends would have
different implications throughout the year and directly affect the surface
evapotranspiration. Moreover, soil-drying trends are mainly associated with
reductions in the large-scale precipitation during spring, summer, and fall and
by enhanced evapotranspiration particularly in spring over the northwestern IP.
In addition, the results show notably changes in soil conditions at high
altitude, particularly during winter, which may alter the land-atmosphere
processes that currently occur in these regions. In this context, noteworthy
changes in the climate system are expected, leading to adverse impacts on water
resources and temperature. The results highlight the complex and nonlinear
nature of land-atmosphere interactions in regions such as the IP, which is a
tremendous challenge for adequately developing mitigation and adaptation
strategies to anthropogenic climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10164v1
Towards A Comprehensive Assessment of AI's Environmental Impact,2024-05-22T21:19:35Z,Srija Chakraborty,"Artificial Intelligence, machine learning (AI/ML) has allowed exploring
solutions for a variety of environmental and climate questions ranging from
natural disasters, greenhouse gas emission, monitoring biodiversity,
agriculture, to weather and climate modeling, enabling progress towards climate

always positive. The recent surge of interest in ML, made possible by
processing very large volumes of data, fueled by access to massive compute
power, has sparked a trend towards large-scale adoption of AI/ML. This interest
places tremendous pressure on natural resources, that are often overlooked and

policymakers, stakeholders to adequately implement standards and policies and
track the policy outcome over time. For these policies to be effective, AI's
environmental impact needs to be monitored in a spatially-disaggregated, timely
manner across the globe at the key activity sites. This study proposes a
methodology to track environmental variables relating to the multifaceted
impact of AI around datacenters using openly available energy data and globally

meteorological scenarios to explore the impacts of both average climatic
changes and the intensification of extreme weather events. We find that
addressing extreme weather in power system planning will require an extra 5-8
GW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, on top of the 50 GW of the additional solar
PV capacity required by the mitigation target alone. Despite the higher initial
investments, we find that the adoption of renewable technologies, especially

aridity index, and rooting depth as predictors, achieved an R2 of 0.66 and a

Regional differences were observed, with higher ET increases in mid-to-high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and decreases in some mid-to-low latitudes
and the Southern Hemisphere. In drylands, ET and temperature were weakly
correlated, while in humid areas, the correlation was much higher. The
correlation between ET and precipitation has remained stable over the

spread in future rainfall changes in the tropical Atlantic by the end of the

(ITCZ) and monsoonal regions. While existing studies have identified various
sources of uncertainty, our research uncovers a prominent role played by the
decline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the
inter-model spread. Firstly we examine 30 climate model simulations (using the
ssp5-8.5 scenario) from the CMIP6 archive and show that models that present a
more substantial AMOC decline exhibit an equatorward shift of the ascending
branch of the Atlantic regional Hadley circulation, resulting in a southward
displacement of the ITCZ. Conversely, models characterized by a smaller AMOC
decline do not indicate any ITCZ displacement. Secondly, we use targeted
experiments (using the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment) to specifically isolate the
effects of a weakened AMOC from the changes in precipitation that would occur
if, under continuous global warming, the AMOC did not weaken. Our results
demonstrate that net precipitation anomalies in the abrupt 4xCO2 experiments

  Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning",2024-03-05T08:41:41Z,"Philipp Hess, Michael Aich, Baoxiang Pan, Niklas Boers","Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are
essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic
climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently
high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown
promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming
state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require
computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to
climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a
consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM
simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields
probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the
observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art

weather is expected to increase over the coming decades. As fully-resolved
climate simulations remain computationally intractable, policy makers must rely
on coarse-models to quantify risk for extremes. However, coarse models suffer
from inherent bias due to the ignored ""sub-grid"" scales. We propose a framework
to non-intrusively debias coarse-resolution climate predictions using
neural-network (NN) correction operators. Previous efforts have attempted to
train such operators using loss functions that match statistics. However, this
approach falls short with events that have longer return period than that of
the training data, since the reference statistics have not converged. Here, the
scope is to formulate a learning method that allows for correction of dynamics

where the correction operator is trained using reference data and a coarse
model simulation nudged towards that reference. The method is demonstrated on
debiasing an under-resolved quasi-geostrophic model and the Energy Exascale
Earth System Model (E3SM). For the former, our method enables the
quantification of events that have return period two orders longer than the

"Carbon cycle instability for high-$\mathrm{CO_2}$ exoplanets:
  Implications for habitability",2024-05-08T19:55:13Z,"R. J. Graham, R. T. Pierrehumbert","Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ)
is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement
climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of
instellations by adjusting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ partial pressure
($p\mathrm{CO_2}$). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but
it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on
planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than
those received by even the Archean Earth and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is thought likely
to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to
ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the
hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like
conditions. Here, we use global climate model (GCM) simulations to demonstrate
that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on
planets with $\mathrm{CO_2}$-$\mathrm{H_2O}$ atmospheres at low instellations
and high $p\mathrm{CO_2}$, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing
as $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within
the MAC weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing
$p\mathrm{CO_2}$ for a range of instellations and $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ typical of
the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may
lead to either runaway $\mathrm{CO_2}$ accumulation or depletion of
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ to colder (possibly Snowball) conditions. While the behavior of
the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that
silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer
reaches of the nominal HZ.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05396v1
How optimal control of polar sea-ice depends on its tipping points,2024-07-24T15:29:20Z,"Parvathi Kooloth, Jian Lu, Craig Bakker, Derek DeSantis, Adam Rupe","Several Earth system components are at a high risk of undergoing rapid and
irreversible qualitative changes or `tipping', due to increasing climate
warming. Potential tipping elements include Arctic sea-ice, Atlantic meridional
overturning circulation, and tropical coral reefs. Amidst such immediate
concerns, it has become necessary to investigate the feasibility of arresting
or even reversing the crossing of tipping thresholds using feedback control. In
this paper, we study the control of an idealized diffusive energy balance model
(EBM) for the Earth's climate; this model has two tipping points due to strong
co-albedo feedback. One of these tipping points is a `small icecap' instability
responsible for a rapid transition to an ice-free climate state under
increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. We develop an optimal control strategy
for the EBM under different climate forcing scenarios with the goal of
reversing sea ice loss while minimizing costs. We find that effective control
is achievable for such a system, but the cost of reversing sea-ice loss nearly
quadruples for an initial state that has just tipped as compared to a state
before reaching the tipping point. We also show that thermal inertia may delay
tipping leading to an overshoot of the critical GHG forcing threshold. This may
offer a short intervention window (overshoot window) during which the control
required to reverse sea-ice loss only scales linearly with intervention time.
While systems with larger system inertia may have longer overshoot windows,
this increased elbow room comes with a steeper rise in the requisite control
once the intervention is delayed past this window. Additionally, we find that
the requisite control to restore sea-ice is localized in the polar region.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17357v1

demographic groups. In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is
predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data)
and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the
year 2100. The HeatPath Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to
predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35,999 trip
equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The
analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were

demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to
accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age

indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist,
particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By
showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted

Origin and Limits of Invariant Warming Patterns in Climate Models,2024-11-21T14:47:44Z,"Paolo Giani, Arlene M. Fiore, Glenn Flierl, Raffaele Ferrari, Noelle E. Selin","Climate models exhibit an approximately invariant surface warming pattern in
typical end-of-century projections. This observation has been used extensively
in climate impact assessments for fast calculations of local temperature
anomalies, with a linear procedure known as pattern scaling. At the same time,
emerging research has also shown that time-varying warming patterns are
necessary to explain the time evolution of effective climate sensitivity in
coupled models, a mechanism that is known as the pattern effect and that
seemingly challenges the pattern scaling understanding. Here we present a
simple theory based on local energy balance arguments to reconcile this
apparent contradiction. Specifically, we show that the pattern invariance is an
inherent feature of exponential forcing, linear feedbacks, a constant forcing
pattern and diffusive dynamics. These conditions are approximately met in most
CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), except in the Arctic where nonlinear
feedbacks are important and in regions where aerosols considerably alter the
forcing pattern. In idealized experiments where concentrations of CO2 are
abruptly increased, such as those used to study the pattern effect, the warming
pattern can change considerably over time because of spatially inhomogeneous
ocean heat uptake, even in the absence of nonlinear feedbacks. Our results
illustrate why typical future projections are amenable to pattern scaling, and
provide a plausible explanation of why more complicated approaches, such as
nonlinear emulators, have only shown marginal improvements in accuracy over
simple linear calculations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14183v1

of stochastic chaos and complexity for which the jump-diffusion processes are a
powerful tool to parameterize the missing physics or effects of the unresolved
scales onto the resolved ones.
  By generalizing concepts such as Kolmogorov operators and Green's functions
to this context, we derive fluctuation-dissipation relationships for such

from the eigenmodes of the Kolmogorov operator (Kolmogorov modes) decomposing
the time-lagged correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. The
underlying formulas offer a fresh look on the intimate relationships between
the system's natural variability and its forced variability.
  We apply our theory to a paradigmatic El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
subject to state-dependent jumps and additive white noise parameterizing
intermittent and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, key factors in the actual ENSO
phenomenon. Such stochastic parameterizations are shown to produce stochastic
chaos with an enriched time-variability. The Kolmogorov modes encoding the
latter are then computed, and our Green's functions formulas are shown to
achieve a remarkable accuracy to predict the system's response to
perturbations.
  This work enriches Hasselmann's program by providing a more comprehensive

focusing on historical hotspots, and our approach demonstrates better
performance compared to traditional numerical models in regions such as the
middle south Pacific, equatorial Atlantic near Africa, south Atlantic, and
high-latitude Indian Ocean. We highlight the potential of temporal diffusion to

informed timely decisions. To achieve this goal, we propose a method to
calculate the probability of breaching the limits set out by the Paris

different scenarios and calculating the number of possible outcomes that breach
the limits as a proportion of the total number of outcomes. The probabilities

this investigation decomposed changes in coastal water levels into its
fundamental components to predict maximum water levels for a given coastal

located near the coast of Miami. Hourly mean lower low water (MLLW) levels were
obtained from the National Data Buoy Center from January 28, 1994, through
December 31, 2023. In the temporal dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters were
used to extract long-term trends, annual and daily tides, and higher frequency
harmonics, while in the spectral dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms
with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing were used to confirm known tidal
frequencies and periods. A linear model predicted that the long-term trend in
water level will rise 2.02 feet from January 1994 to December 2050, while a
quadratic model predicted a rise of 5.91 during the same period. In addition,
the combined crests of annual tides, daily tides, and higher frequency
harmonics increase water levels up to 2.16 feet, yielding a combined total of
4.18 feet as a lower bound and a combined total of 8.09 feet as an upper bound.
These findings provide a foundation for more accurate prediction of coastal
flooding during severe weather events and provide an impetus for policy choices

  Deployment of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection",2024-02-19T09:35:18Z,"Ezra Brody, Daniele Visioni, Ewa M. Bednarz, Ben Kravitz, Douglas G. MacMartin, Jadwiga H. Richter, Mari R. Tye","Climate change is a prevalent threat, and it is unlikely that current
mitigation efforts will be enough to avoid unwanted impacts. One potential
option to reduce climate change impacts is the use of stratospheric aerosol
injection (SAI). Even if SAI is ultimately deployed, it might be initiated only
after some temperature target is exceeded. The consequences of such a delay are
assessed herein. This study compares two cases, with the same target global
mean temperature of 1.5C above preindustrial, but start dates of 2035 or a
delayed start in 2045. We make use of simulations in the Community Earth System
Model version 2 with the Whole Atmosphere Coupled Chemistry Model version 6
(CESM2-WACCM6), using SAI under the SSP2-4.5 emissions pathway. We find that
delaying the start of deployment (relative to the target temperature)
necessitates lower net radiative forcing (-30%) and thus larger sulfur dioxide
injection rates (+20%), even after surface temperatures converge, to compensate
for the extra energy absorbed by the Earth system. However, many of the surface
climate differences between the 2035 and 2045 start simulations appear to be
small during the 10-25 years following the delayed SAI start, although longer
simulations would be needed to assess any longer-term impacts in this model. In
addition, irreversibilities and tipping points that might be triggered during
the period of increased warming may not be adequately represented in the model
but could change this conclusion in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11992v1

used to simulate, for the period 1959-2015, the forage production of a mown

management conditions, with meteorological inputs extracted from the SAFRAN
atmospheric database. The aim was to generate purely climate-dependent
timeseries of optimal forage production, a variable that was maximized by
brighter and warmer weather conditions at the grassland. A long-term increase
was observed in simulated forage yield, with the 1995-2015 average being 29%
higher than the 1959-1979 average. Such increase seems consistent with observed
rising trends in temperature and CO2, and multi-decadal changes in incident
solar radiation. At interannual timescales, sea surface temperature anomalies
of the Mediterranean (MED), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), equatorial Pacific

burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to
climate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing
challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep
understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the
use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a
framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior
research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the
hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for
policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse
six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax,
Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our
findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing
emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide
additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence
supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally,
we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming

CO2 emission trends and classify countries based on their emission patterns to
effectively mitigate worldwide carbon emission. This paper presents an in-depth
comparative study on the determinants of CO2 emission in twenty countries with
high Human Development Index (HDI), exploring factors related to economy,

Reconciling risk-based and storyline attribution with Bayes theorem,2024-07-15T14:55:17Z,"Sebastian Buschow, Petra Friederichs, Andreas Hense","The question to what extent climate change is responsible for extreme weather
events has been at the forefront of public and scholarly discussion for years.
Proponents of the ""risk-based"" approach to attribution attempt to give an
unconditional answer based on the probability of some class of events in a
world with and without human influences. As an alternative, so-called
""storyline"" studies investigate the impact of a warmer world on a single,
specific weather event. This can be seen as a conditional attribution
statement. In this study, we connect conditional to unconditional attribution
using Bayes theorem: in essence, the conditional statement is composed of two
unconditional statements, one based on all available data (event and
conditions) and one based on the conditions alone. We explore the effects of
the conditioning in a simple statistical toy model and a real-world attribution
of European summer temperatures conditional on blocking. The resulting
attribution statement is generally strengthened if the conditions are not
affected by climate change. Conversely, if part of the trend is contained in
the conditions, a weaker attribution statement may result.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10776v1

extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our
results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise
tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in
intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and
assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings

climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution
studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes
this task a challenging one, even more so for ""record-shattering"" events that
have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to
simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge
computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of
centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows
to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct
simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons,
corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a
heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show
that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with
much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the
computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated
through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results
reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic
anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary
wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the
intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering
insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave

that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological

Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small
environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain
that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization
effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis.
Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne
for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC
cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC
costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's
DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning
cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in
Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC
identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced
by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in
cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning
by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate
change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale
have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology

"Deep Learning for Hydroelectric Optimization: Generating Long-Term River
  Discharge Scenarios with Ensemble Forecasts from Global Circulation Models",2024-12-16T16:37:27Z,Julio Alberto Silva Dias,"Hydroelectric power generation is a critical component of the global energy
matrix, particularly in countries like Brazil, where it represents the majority
of the energy supply. However, its strong dependence on river discharges, which
are inherently uncertain due to climate variability, poses significant
challenges. River discharges are linked to precipitation patterns, making the
development of accurate probabilistic forecasting models crucial for improving
operational planning in systems heavily reliant on this resource.
Traditionally, statistical models have been used to represent river discharges
in energy optimization. Yet, these models are increasingly unable to produce
realistic scenarios due to structural shifts in climate behavior. Changes in
precipitation patterns have altered discharge dynamics, which traditional
approaches struggle to capture. Machine learning methods, while effective as
universal predictors for time series, often focus solely on historical data,
ignoring key external factors such as meteorological and climatic conditions.
Furthermore, these methods typically lack a probabilistic framework, which is
vital for representing the inherent variability of hydrological processes. The
limited availability of historical discharge data further complicates the
application of large-scale deep learning models to this domain. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework based on a modified recurrent neural
network architecture. This model generates parameterized probability
distributions conditioned on projections from global circulation models,
effectively accounting for the stochastic nature of river discharges.
Additionally, the architecture incorporates enhancements to improve its
generalization capabilities. We validate this framework within the Brazilian
Interconnected System, using projections from the SEAS5-ECMWF system as
conditional variables.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12234v1

explored for storyline-based climate attribution due to their short inference
times, which can accelerate the number of events studied, and provide real time
attributions when public attention is heightened. The analysis is framed on the
extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the
Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future
simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the
pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals,
respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model
which represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments.
Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in
the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to
the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different
geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the
AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the
physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to
simulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the
dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for
the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (>500
members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial
attribution results, unlike the >20-member ensemble from the dynamical model.

which will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of
natural resources. It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate
change will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or
more significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known
as agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of
raising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible
for it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity.
The agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging
technologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors,
smart farming transforms traditional production methods and international
agricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is
optimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The
agricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the
fourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods
with cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and
efficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the
agriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities,

contemporary adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated the
contemporary evolution of four populations of the cold-water kelp Laminaria
digitata by analysing their spatial and temporal genomic variation using
ddRAD-sequencing. These populations were sampled from the center to the
southern margin of its north-eastern Atlantic distribution at two-time points,
spanning at least two generations. Through genome scans for local adaptation at
a single time point, we identified candidate loci that showed clinal variation
correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) along latitudinal
gradients. This finding suggests that SST may drive the adaptive response of
these kelp populations, although factors such as species' demographic history
should also be considered. Additionally, we performed a simulation approach to
distinguish the effect of selection from genetic drift in allele frequency
changes over time. This enabled the detection of loci in the southernmost
population that exhibited temporal differentiation beyond what would be
expected from genetic drift alone: these are candidate loci which could have
evolved under selection over time. In contrast, we did not detect any outlier
locus based on temporal differentiation in the population from the North Sea,
which also displayed low and decreasing levels of genetic diversity. The
diverse evolutionary scenarios observed among populations can be attributed to
variations in the prevalence of selection relative to genetic drift across
different environments. Therefore, our study highlights the potential of
temporal genomics to offer valuable insights into the contemporary evolution of
marine foundation species facing climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14003v1

changes, significantly impact regions on the leeward side of mountain ranges,
e.g., by spreading wildfires. Understanding how foehn occurrences change under
climate change is crucial. Unfortunately, foehn cannot be measured directly but
has to be inferred from meteorological measurements employing suitable
classification schemes. Hence, this approach is typically limited to specific
periods for which the necessary data are available. We present a novel approach
for reconstructing historical foehn occurrences using a combination of
unsupervised and supervised probabilistic statistical learning methods. We
utilize in-situ measurements (available for recent decades) to train an
unsupervised learner (finite mixture model) for automatic foehn classification.
These labeled data are then linked to reanalysis data (covering longer periods)
using a supervised learner (lasso or boosting). This allows to reconstruct past
foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to
ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves
accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence,

that when considered in the context of the long-term trend over the last

appear exceptional. Both the yearly means and the number of episodes with
extreme values for this period are within the one standard deviation of the
long-term trends. We conclude that the spatially and temporally very localized
reductions do not add up to statistically significant reductions in the global

  Environment: Analysis of GGDP based on SEEA model",2024-09-04T12:19:11Z,Mingpu Ma,"This paper presents an analysis of Green Gross Domestic Product (GGDP) using
the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) model to evaluate its
impact on global climate mitigation and economic health. GGDP is proposed as a
superior measure to tradi-tional GDP by incorporating natural resource
consumption, environmental pollution control, and degradation factors. The
study develops a GGDP model and employs grey correlation analysis and grey
prediction models to assess its relationship with these factors. Key findings
demonstrate that replacing GDP with GGDP can positively influence climate
change, partic-ularly in reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing global
temperatures. The analysis further explores the implications of GGDP adoption
across developed and developing countries, with specific predictions for China
and the United States. The results indicate a potential increase in economic
levels for developing countries, while developed nations may experi-ence a
decrease. Additionally, the shift to GGDP is shown to significantly reduce
natural re-source depletion and population growth rates in the United States,
suggesting broader envi-ronmental and economic benefits. This paper highlights
the universal applicability of the GGDP model and its potential to enhance
environmental and economic policies globally.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02642v1

Masked Autoregressive Model for Weather Forecasting,2024-09-30T09:17:04Z,"Doyi Kim, Minseok Seo, Hakjin Lee, Junghoon Seo","The growing impact of global climate change amplifies the need for accurate

this issue, but it struggles to maintain crucial correlations in atmospheric
events. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Masked Autoregressive
Model for Weather Forecasting (MAM4WF). This model leverages masked modeling,
where portions of the input data are masked during training, allowing the model
to learn robust spatiotemporal relationships by reconstructing the missing

traditional time-series models. Existing procedures, however, mostly consist of
testing necessary but not sufficient conditions, leading to under-rejection, or
sufficient but non-necessary ones, which leads to over-rejection. Moreover,

systematically collated and synthesized. A global evidence map of NCS
co-impacts would overcome key barriers to NCS implementation by providing
relevant information on co-benefits and trade-offs where carbon mitigation
potential alone does not justify NCS projects. We employ large language models
to assess over two million articles, finding 257,266 relevant articles on NCS

examine multiple NCS pathways, indicating natural NCS pathway complements, and
each NCS is often associated with two or more coimpacts. Finally, NCS
co-impacts evidence and priority areas for NCS are often mismatched--some

temperature (UST) and surface temperature, as well as various climate drivers

cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE). We strikingly found warming trends of
0.77(+/-0.57) and 0.69(+/-0.22) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the
Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar
regions since 2002. These UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing and no
significant trends in total GHG effect in polar and non-polar regions
respectively. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of surface cooling
trends in both the Antarctic since 2005 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE
started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which causes
the recent rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST). These temperature
changing patterns are consistent with the characteristics of the
cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction (CRE) mechanism of halogen-containing GHGs
(halo-GHGs) with larger destruction rates at higher latitudes. Moreover, the
no-parameter physics model of warming caused by halo-GHGs reproduces closely
the observed GMSTs from 2000 to 2024, including the almost no warming during
2000-2012 and the significant warming by 0.2-0.3 deg C during 2013-2023, of
which 0.27 deg C was calculated to arise from the net radiative forcing of
aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The results also show that the
physics model captures 76% of the variance in the observed GMSTs, exhibiting a
warming peak in October 2023 and predicting a gradual GMST reversal thereafter.

energy. Daily torpor, a temporally controlled reduction of the metabolic rate

fluctuations in ambient temperature and humidity, the higher was the general
resting metabolic rate and the rate of its reduction, but the lower was the

arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation.
Adversely affected biological productivity has a negative impact on social,
economic, and environmental factors. The term 'arid ecosystems' refers not only
to water-scarce landscapes but also to nutrient-poor environments.
Specifically, the vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity as aridity
increases, and the self-organized heterogeneous vegetation patterns developed
could eventually collapse into a bare state. It is still unclear whether this
transition would be gradual or abrupt, leading to the often-called catastrophic
shift of ecosystems. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities
in time or space can promote a gradual transition to bare soil, thus avoiding
catastrophic shifts. Environmental inhomogeneities include non-uniformities in
the spatial distribution of precipitation, spatial irregularities in topography
and other external factors. Employing a generic mathematical model including
environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation
patterns create a hysteresis loop when the effective mortality level changes.
These two branches correspond to qualitatively distinct vegetation
self-organized responses. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an
equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass forming self-organized patterns
with a well-defined wavelength. However, reversing the mortality trend, one
observes a low biomass branch lacking a wavelength. We call this phenomenon the
clustering of vegetation patches. This behavior can be connected to
historically significant trends of climate change in arid ecosystems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12581v1

temperature. This ``top-down'' approach produces an RCE state with a deeper,
drier boundary layer, which weakens convective precipitation extremes in three
distinct ways. First, the lifted condensation level is higher, leading to a
small thermodynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Second, the higher
lifted condensation level also reduces positive buoyancy in the lower
troposphere, leading to a dynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Third,
precipitation re-evaporates more readily when falling through a deeper, drier
boundary layer, leading to a substantial decrease in precipitation efficiency.
These three effects all follow from changes in near-surface relative humidity
and are physically distinct from the mechanism that underpins the
Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate. Overall, our results suggest that changes in
relative humidity must be taken into account when seeking to understand and
predict changes in convective precipitation extremes over land.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16306v1
"Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Change Detection: Novel
  Architecture and Analysis of Domain Shift",2024-07-10T12:54:51Z,"Elliot Vincent, Jean Ponce, Mathieu Aubry","Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on
Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and
disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with
satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection
and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves
over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and
leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases,
models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge.
We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global,
multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the
spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of
temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on
semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving
further attention.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07616v1
Detection of Critical Events in Renewable Energy Production Time Series,2024-01-31T13:13:37Z,"Laurens P. Stoop, Erik Duijm, Ad J. Feelders, Machteld van den Broek","The introduction of more renewable energy sources into the energy system
increases the variability and weather dependence of electricity generation.
Power system simulations are used to assess the adequacy and reliability of the
electricity grid over decades, but often become computational intractable for
such long simulation periods with high technical detail. To alleviate this
computational burden, we investigate the use of outlier detection algorithms to
find periods of extreme renewable energy generation which enables detailed
modelling of the performance of power systems under these circumstances.
Specifically, we apply the Maximum Divergent Intervals (MDI) algorithm to power
generation time series that have been derived from ERA5 historical climate
reanalysis covering the period from 1950 through 2019. By applying the MDI
algorithm on these time series, we identified intervals of extreme low and high
energy production. To determine the outlierness of an interval different
divergence measures can be used. Where the cross-entropy measure results in
shorter and strongly peaking outliers, the unbiased Kullback-Leibler divergence
tends to detect longer and more persistent intervals. These intervals are
regarded as potential risks for the electricity grid by domain experts,
showcasing the capability of the MDI algorithm to detect critical events in
these time series. For the historical period analysed, we found no trend in
outlier intensity, or shift and lengthening of the outliers that could be
attributed to climate change. By applying MDI on climate model output, power
system modellers can investigate the adequacy and possible changes of risk for
the current and future electricity grid under a wider range of scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17814v2

midcentury, there are questions about how these targets alter household welfare
and finances, including distributional effects across income groups. This paper
examines the distributional dimensions of technology transitions and net-zero
policies with a focus on welfare impacts across household incomes. The analysis
uses a model intercomparison with a range of energy-economy models using
harmonized policy scenarios reaching economy-wide, net-zero CO2 emissions
across the United States in 2050. We employ a novel linking approach that
connects output from detailed energy system models with survey microdata on
energy expenditures across income classes to provide distributional analysis of
net-zero policies. Although there are differences in model structure and input
assumptions, we find broad agreement in qualitative trends in policy incidence
and energy burdens across income groups. Models generally agree that direct
energy expenditures for many households will likely decline over time with
reference and net-zero policies. However, there is variation in the extent of
changes relative to current levels, energy burdens relative to reference
levels, and electricity expenditures. Policy design, primarily how climate
policy revenues are used, has first-order impacts on distributional outcomes.
Net-zero policy costs, in both absolute and relative terms, are unevenly
distributed across households, and relative increases in energy expenditures
are higher for lowest-income households. However, we also find that recycled
revenues from climate policies have countervailing effects when rebated on a
per-capita basis, offsetting higher energy burdens and potentially even leading
to net progressive outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18748v1

"At the junction between deep learning and statistics of extremes:
  formalizing the landslide hazard definition",2024-01-25T14:48:08Z,"Ashok Dahal, Raphaël Huser, Luigi Lombardo","The most adopted definition of landslide hazard combines spatial information
about landslide location (susceptibility), threat (intensity), and frequency
(return period). Only the first two elements are usually considered and
estimated when working over vast areas. Even then, separate models constitute
the standard, with frequency being rarely investigated. Frequency and intensity
are intertwined and depend on each other because larger events occur less
frequently and vice versa. However, due to the lack of multi-temporal
inventories and joint statistical models, modelling such properties via a
unified hazard model has always been challenging and has yet to be attempted.
Here, we develop a unified model to estimate landslide hazard at the slope unit
level to address such gaps. We employed deep learning, combined with a model
motivated by extreme-value theory to analyse an inventory of 30 years of
observed rainfall-triggered landslides in Nepal and assess landslide hazard for
multiple return periods. We also use our model to further explore landslide
hazard for the same return periods under different climate change scenarios up
to the end of the century. Our results show that the proposed model performs
excellently and can be used to model landslide hazard in a unified manner.
Geomorphologically, we find that under both climate change scenarios (SSP245

in the lower Himalayan regions while remaining the same in the middle Himalayan
region whilst decreasing slightly in the upper Himalayan region areas.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14210v1

such highly specific hardware. In this study, we perform a cradle-to-gate life
cycle assessment (LCA) of dedicated Bitcoin mining equipment, considering their
specific architecture. Our results show that the application-specific
integrated circuit designed for Bitcoin mining is the main contributor to
production-related impacts. This observation applies to most impact categories,
including the global warming potential. In addition, this finding stresses out
the necessity to carefully consider the specificity of the hardware. By
comparing these results with several usage scenarios, we also demonstrate that
the impacts of producing this type of equipment can be significant (up to 80%
of the total life cycle impacts), depending on the sources of electricity
supply for the use phase. Therefore, we highlight the need to consider the
production phase when assessing the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining

ecoinvent databases for the background modeling of our system. Surprisingly, it
leads to results with variations of up to 4 orders of magnitude for

  Earth's orbital eccentricity (g2-g5): Implications for astrochronology",2024-03-14T12:20:59Z,"Richard E. Zeebe, Margriet L. Lantink","The planets' gravitational interaction causes rhythmic changes in Earth's
orbital parameters (also called Milankovi\'c cycles), which have powerful
applications in geology and astrochronology. For instance, the primary
astronomical eccentricity cycle due to the secular frequency term (g2-g5) (~405
kyr in the recent past) utilized in deep-time analyses is dominated by Venus'
and Jupiter's orbits, aka long eccentricity cycle. The widely accepted and
long-held view is that (g2-g5) was practically stable in the past and may hence
be used as a ""metronome"" to reconstruct accurate ages and chronologies.
However, using state-of-the-art integrations of the solar system, we show here
that (g2-g5) can become unstable over long time scales, without major changes
in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. The (g2-g5) disruption is due to
the secular resonance $\sigma_{12}$ = (g1 - g2) + (s1 - s2), a major
contributor to solar system chaos. We demonstrate that entering/exiting the
$\sigma_{12}$ resonance is a common phenomenon on long time scales, occurring
in ~40% of our solutions. During $\sigma_{12}$-resonance episodes, (g2-g5) is
very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing
spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. Our results have
fundamental implications for geology and astrochronology, as well as climate
forcing because the paradigm that the longest Milankovi\'c cycle dominates
Earth's astronomical forcing, is stable, and has a period of ~405 kyr requires

hydrogen systems, can help mitigate climate change by ensuring a more stable
and sustainable power supply. To maximize the effectiveness of such energy
storage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each
time period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional
optimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to
dynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging
and discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete
reinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based
on state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement
learning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible
charge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for
learning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the
objectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value
learning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by
preventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous
full charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the

waves with return times of a few years like in previous studies, but we also
propose a new methodological approach, return time maps, that allows us to
study rare heat waves with return times from 10 to 50 years. We use the outputs
from three climate models, namely IPSL-CM6A-LR, EC-Earth3, and CNRM-CM6-1, in
which North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are restored towards the observed
AMV anomalies. The three models give consistent results, with the exception of
EC-Earth simulating a much greater influence of soil moisture. Typical AMV or
spring soil moisture anomalies induce changes in the temperature and duration
of heat waves that are of comparable amplitude, but follow different regional
patterns. As might be expected, a positive AMV phase or low soil moisture
induces hotter and longer typical heat waves over most of Europe. However,
counter-intuitively, they also induce less heat wave days and cooler heat waves
over part of Northeast Europe. For more extreme events, the influence of the
AMV and soil moisture increase, according to rather similar regional patterns

global biogeochemical cycles. Despite its importance, the complex architecture
of soil pores and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions remain poorly
understood. This perspective aims to address this gap by applying symmetry and
symmetry-breaking concepts through fractal geometry to elucidate the structural
and functional complexities of soil pores. We highlight how fractal parameters
can quantify the self-similar nature of soil pore structures, revealing their
size, shape, and connectivity. These geometric attributes influence soil
properties such as permeability and diffusivity, which are essential for
understanding gas exchange and microbial activity within the soil matrix.
Furthermore, we emphasize the effects of various land management practices,
including tillage and wetting-drying cycles, on soil pore complexity using
three-dimensional multi-fractal analysis. Literature indicates that different
agricultural practices significantly alter pore heterogeneity and connectivity,
affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional tillage decreases pore
connectivity and increases randomness, whereas no-tillage preserves larger,
more complex pore structures. We propose that integrating combinatorial,
geometric, and functional symmetry concepts offers a comprehensive framework
for examining the structure-property-function relationships in soil. This novel
approach could enhance our understanding of soil's role in the global cycle of

trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on
relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for
the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the

introduces a pipeline that integrates principles from both perturbation-based

The proposed pipeline simplifies the undertaking of diverse investigative

also acts as an air pollutant. Given its high radiative forcing potential and
relatively short atmospheric lifetime (9$\pm$1 years), methane has important
implications for climate change, therefore, cutting methane emissions is
crucial for effective climate change mitigation. This work expands existing
information on operational methane point source detection sensors in the
Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. It reviews the state-of-the-art for

Explainable artificial intelligence was used to analyze the model's predictions
during the October 2020 Central South America compound heatwave and drought

counterfactual, finding that the average temperature and surface pressure are
generally the best predictors under normal conditions. In contrast, minimum
anomalies of evaporation and surface latent heat flux take the lead during the
event. A change of regime is also observed in the attributions before the

housing, amplifying existing vulnerabilities within communities. Understanding
the interplay between climate change, wildfires, evacuation patterns, and
socioeconomic factors is crucial for developing effective mitigation and
adaptation strategies. To contribute to this challenge, we use high-definition
mobile phone records to analyse evacuation patterns during the wildfires in
Valpara\'iso, Chile, that took place between February 2-3, 2024. This data
allows us to track the movements of individuals in the disaster area, providing
insight into how people respond to large-scale evacuations in the context of
severe wildfires. We apply a causal inference approach that combines regression
discontinuity and difference-in-differences methodologies to observe evacuation
behaviours during wildfires, with a focus on socioeconomic stratification. This
approach allows us to isolate the impact of the wildfires on different
socioeconomic groups by comparing the evacuation patterns of affected
populations before and after the event, while accounting for underlying trends
and discontinuities at the threshold of the disaster. We find that many people
spent nights away from home, with those in the lowest socioeconomic segment
stayed away the longest. In general, people reduced their travel distance
during the evacuation, and the lowest socioeconomic group moved the least.
Initially, movements became more random, as people sought refuge in a rush, but

Hybrid Bayesian Smoothing on Surfaces,2024-10-28T19:14:55Z,"Matthew Hofkes, Douglas Nychka","Modeling spatial processes that exhibit both smooth and rough features poses
a significant challenge. This is especially true in fields where complex
physical variables are observed across spatial domains. Traditional spatial
techniques, such as Gaussian processes (GPs), are ill-suited to capture sharp
transitions and discontinuities in spatial fields. In this paper, we propose a
new approach incorporating non-Gaussian processes (NGPs) into a hybrid model
which identifies both smooth and rough components. Specifically, we model the
rough process using scaled mixtures of Gaussian distributions in a Bayesian
hierarchical model (BHM).
  Our motivation comes from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble
(CESM-LE), where we seek to emulate climate sensitivity fields that exhibit
complex spatial patterns, including abrupt transitions at ocean-land
boundaries. We demonstrate that traditional GP models fail to capture such
abrupt changes and that our proposed hybrid model, implemented through a full
Gibbs sampler. This significantly improves model interpretability and accurate
recovery of process parameters.
  Through a multi-factor simulation study, we evaluate the performance of
several scaled mixtures designed to model the rough process. The results
highlight the advantages of using these heavier tailed priors as a replacement
to the Bayesian fused LASSO. One prior in particular, the normal Jeffrey's
prior stands above the rest. We apply our model to the CESM-LE dataset,
demonstrating its ability to better represent the mean function and its
uncertainty in climate sensitivity fields.
  This work combines the strengths of GPs for smooth processes with the
flexibility of NGPs for abrupt changes. We provide a computationally efficient

At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to

in these changes, causing severe economic and environmental damage. This study
presents a novel predictive model that integrates systematically local and
global climatic signals to forecast Super El Ni\~no events, introducing the
Super El Ni\~no Index (SEI), which value of 80 or higher defines a Super El

Ni\~no events, including those from 1982-83, 1997-98, and 2015-16, with SEI
values for these periods containing 80 within the 2-sigma standard deviation.
Using data up to 2022, our model predicted an SEI of around 80 for 2023,
indicating a Super El Ni\~no for the 2023-24 period. Recent observations
confirm that the 2023-24 El Ni\~no is among the five strongest recorded Super
El Ni\~no events in history. An analysis of SEI trends from 1982 to 2023
reveals a gradual increase, with recent El Ni\~no events consistently exceeding
SEI values of 70. This trend suggests that El Ni\~no events are increasingly
approaching Super El Ni\~no intensity, potentially due to more favorable

ecological benefits is uncertain. Here, we quantified the long-term effects of
agricultural diversification practices on socioeconomic and ecological benefits

showed that, with neutral crop yield over time, financial profitability, most
variables related to biological communities, all aspects of soil quality, and
carbon sequestration benefits increased by up to 2823% over 20 years of
practice. Non-crop diversification practices and the use of organic amendments
increased benefits by up to 2000% after 50 years. A trade-off analysis between
yield and other services showed win-win outcomes during the first 25 years. Our

Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems,2024-05-01T08:42:22Z,"Fredrik Hagström, Vikas Garg, Fabricio Oliveira","Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption. A considerable
portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems
has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In
recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been
increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt
purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical
controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal
comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency,
requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them
inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. Hence, common research goals
are to improve the learning speed, as well as to improve their ability to
generalize, in order to facilitate transfer learning to unseen building
environments. In this paper, we take a federated learning approach to training
the reinforcement learning controller of an HVAC system. A global control
policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data
centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to
simultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. The
federated optimization strategy indirectly increases both the rate at which
experience data is collected and the variation in the data. We demonstrate
through experimental evaluation that these effects lead to a faster learning
speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy
compared to any individually trained policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00389v1

  and Demographic Shifts in Austrian Districts",2024-05-01T14:27:15Z,"Hannah Schuster, Axel Polleres, Amin Anjomshoaa, Johannes Wachs","The impact of hot weather on health outcomes of a population is mediated by a
variety of factors, including its age profile and local green infrastructure.
The combination of warming due to climate change and demographic aging suggests
that heat-related health outcomes will deteriorate in the coming decades. Here,
we measure the relationship between weekly all-cause mortality and heat days in
Austrian districts using a panel dataset covering $2015-2022$. An additional
day reaching $30$ degrees is associated with a $2.4\%$ increase in mortality
per $1000$ inhabitants during summer. This association is roughly doubled in
districts with a two standard deviation above average share of the population
over $65$. Using forecasts of hot days (RCP) and demographics in $2050$, we
observe that districts will have elderly populations and hot days $2-5$
standard deviations above the current mean in just $25$ years. This predicts a
drastic increase in heat-related mortality. At the same time, district green
scores, measured using $10\times 10$ meter resolution satellite images of
residential areas, significantly moderate the relationship between heat and
mortality. Thus, although local policies likely cannot reverse warming or
demographic trends, they can take measures to mediate the health consequences
of these growing risks, which are highly heterogeneous across regions, even in

Discrete element method model of soot aggregates,2024-07-16T03:31:47Z,"Egor V. Demidov, Gennady Y. Gor, Alexei F. Khalizov","Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by
scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates
composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire
coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction
of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently,
no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring,
reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a
discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot
aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by
sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy
data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of
necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer
necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking
prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of
nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging
through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot
aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured
simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly
compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254v3

Modeling Snow on Sea Ice using Physics Guided Machine Learning,2024-09-12T14:45:07Z,"Ayush Prasad, Ioanna Merkouriadi, Aleksi Nummelin","Snow is a crucial element of the sea ice system, affecting sea ice growth and
decay due to its low thermal conductivity and high albedo. Despite its
importance, present-day climate models have an idealized representation of
snow, often including only single-layer thermodynamics and omitting several
processes that shape its properties. Although advanced snow process models like
SnowModel exist, they are often excluded from climate modeling due to their
high computational costs. SnowModel simulates snow depth, density, blowing-snow
redistribution, sublimation, grain size, and thermal conductivity in a
multi-layer snowpack. It operates with high spatial (1 meter) and temporal (1
hour) resolution. However, for large regions like the Arctic Ocean, these
high-resolution simulations face challenges such as slow processing and large
resource requirements. Data-driven emulators are used to address these issues,
but they often lack generalizability and consistency with physical laws. In our

incorporates physical laws governing changes in snow density due to compaction.
We evaluated three machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Physics-Guided LSTM, and Random Forest across five Arctic regions. All models
achieved high accuracy, with the Physics-Guided LSTM showing the best

"Interpolation-Free Deep Learning for Meteorological Downscaling on
  Unaligned Grids Across Multiple Domains with Application to Wind Power",2024-10-04T22:04:40Z,"Jean-Sébastien Giroux, Simon-Philippe Breton, Julie Carreau","As climate change intensifies, the shift to cleaner energy sources becomes
increasingly urgent. With wind energy production set to accelerate, reliable
wind probabilistic forecasts are essential to ensure its efficient use.
However, since numerical weather prediction models are computationally
expensive, probabilistic forecasts are produced at resolutions too coarse to
capture all mesoscale wind behaviors. Statistical downscaling, typically
applied to enchance the resolution of climate model simulations, presents a
viable solution with lower computational costs by learning a mapping from
low-resolution (LR) variables to high-resolution (HR) meteorological variables.
Leveraging deep learning, we evaluate a downscaling model based on a
state-of-the-art U-Net architecture, applied to an ensemble member from a
coarse-scale probabilistic forecast of wind velocity. The architecture is
modified to incorporate (1) a learned grid alignment strategy to resolve LR-HR
grid mismatches and (2) a processing module for multi-level atmospheric
predictors. To extend the downscaling model's applicability from fixed spatial
domains to the entire Canadian region, we assess a transfer learning approach.
Our results show that the learned grid alignment strategy performs as well as
conventional pre-processing interpolation steps and that LR wind speed at
multiple levels is sufficient as a predictor, enabling a more compact
architecture. Additionally, they suggest that extending to new spatial domains
using transfer learning is promising, and that downscaled wind velocities
demonstrate potential in improving the detection of wind power ramps, a
critical phenomenon for wind energy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03945v1

  Revisited",2024-10-14T07:12:06Z,Axel Kleidon,"Life is a planetary feature that depends on its environment, but it has also
strongly shaped the physical conditions on Earth, having created conditions
highly suitable for a productive biosphere. Clearly, the second law of
thermodynamics must apply to these dynamics as well, but how? What insights can
we gain by placing life and its effects on planetary functioning in the context
of the second law? In Kleidon (2010), I described a thermodynamic Earth system
perspective by placing the functioning of the Earth system in terms of the
second law. The Earth system is represented by a planetary hierarchy of energy
transformations that are driven predominantly by incoming solar radiation,
these transformations are constrained by the second law, but they are also
modified by the feedbacks from various dissipative activities. It was then
hypothesised that life evolves its dissipative activity to the limits imposed
by this hierarchy and evolves feedbacks aimed at pushing these limits to higher
levels of dissipative activity. Here I provide an update of this perspective. I
first review applications to climate and global climate change to demonstrate
its success in predicting magnitudes of physical processes, particularly
regarding temperatures, heat redistribution and hydrological cycling. I then
focus on the limits to dissipative activity of the biosphere. It would seem
that the limitations by thermodynamics act indirectly by imposing limitations

"Simulation and Data Assimilation in an Idealized Coupled
  Atmosphere-Ocean-Sea Ice Floe Model with Cloud Effects",2024-10-30T15:53:51Z,"Changhong Mou, Samuel N. Stechmann, Nan Chen","Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the
Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice
between the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands,
understanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change
impacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely
overlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled
atmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects,
tackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems.
Sea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates
floes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a
two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and
ice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated
precipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces
and ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized
coupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between
atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds
and precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It
also serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of
unobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties.
Numerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data
assimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful
inference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These
results imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data
assimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23138v1

Types (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse
categorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate,
soil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant
adaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth
observations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing
environments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a
differentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the
spatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with
environmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our
model unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with
process-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions
and their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less
than half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon
fluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely
driven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned
environment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at
unseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics,
and agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying
parameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global
carbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding

analyzed using two drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI),

more moderate for the near future. However, the results also indicated key
differences between indices. Projected drought conditions by using the SPEI

sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link
between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST
patterns, known as the ""pattern effect"", is typically diagnosed by studying the
response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we
diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized
warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by
studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by
atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature.
Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled
interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a
novel ""sensitivity map"" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to
SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a
spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in
traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in
externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate
studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks.
The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the
traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way
influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective
by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This
alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the
coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further
impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585v4

Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in
temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the
Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it effects large biochemical networks
with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it
has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a
characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a

geopolitical instability, climate change, and black swan events such as the
unforeseen closure of the Suez Canal. The problem of predicting local price
change under modification of an underlying transport network or change in
supply characteristics unites elements of game theory, network theory and
transport. The Cournot Oligopoly models economic actors as rational players
attempting to maximise profit by optimising supply quantities with analytical
results now consolidated about equilibrium characteristics where transport
conditions are fixed. Similarly, where supply and demand are fixed, the routing
of goods in a transport network can be analytically solved through a traffic
assignment problem. Hence we can solve the coupled Cournot-congestion problem
by means of a 2-layer network. Where the layers are linked, inter-layer
feedback wherein players attempt to maximise their utility occurs. In this
respect we find players benefit from taking advantage of non-simultaneous
responses to the market rather than moving to a new equilibrium. We draw
conclusions about the nature of equilibria, finding that the concave utility
curve property results in unique and stable equilibrium for each uncoupled
layer, while linked layers have a non-unique stable equilibria for which
general solutions are stated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19079v1

Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in three temperature levels (15, 25

insecticides based on acephate, spinosad and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin,

other hand, methoxyfenozide + spinetoram caused average mortalities of 88.75%

caused by chlorfenapyr at 15, 25 and 30 {\deg}C were 1.25, 71.25 and 71.25%. On
the other hand, surviving adults in lethal toxicity bioassay did not show
differences in egg parasitism (F0 generation) and emergence of F1 generation in
all temperature levels studied; however, the insecticide methoxyfenozide +
spinetoram showed the lowest level of parasitism and emergence of T. podisi. In
addition, our results demonstrated significant changes in the proportion of
emerged males and females as the temperature increased; however, we did not
find any differences when comparing the insecticides studied. Furthermore, we
detected a significant interaction between insecticides and temperatures by
contaminating the host's parasitized eggs (parasitoid pupal stage). Generally,
the highest emergence reduction values were found at the highest temperature

"The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring
  changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs",2024-03-27T01:55:57Z,"Sage Anastasi, Giulio Dalla Riva","In this paper we present new methods that extend Baldassari and Gelman's
theory of polarisation. They show that it is useful to define polarisation as
increasing correlation between positions in an ideological field, which reduces
political pluralism. We also draw from post-structuralist work which argues
that deliberate development of these correlations is a feature of polarised
regimes such as apartheid.
  To measure polarisation in social networks, we use Random Dot Product Graphs
to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of a
social network provides an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the
number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. Each uncorrelated dimension
in a social network represents a part of that society which allows two people
from different groups to form a social connection, such as living in a racially
integrated neighbourhood. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the
embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are
becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We apply this method to the communication interactions among New Zealand
Twitter users discussing climate change issues from 2017 to 2023. We find that
the discussion is more polarised after 2020 than before, as shown by a decrease
in the dimensionality of the communication network. Second, we apply this
method to discussions of the COP climate change conferences, showing that our
methods agree with other researchers' detections of polarisation in this space.
Finally, we use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an
increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the
predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease
the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation
processes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191v2

  interacting bistable elements",2024-01-19T04:29:43Z,"Hidemasa Ishii, Hiroshi Kori","Diverse complex systems often undergo sudden changes in their states, such as
epileptic seizures, climate changes, and social uprisings. Such behavior has
been modeled by noise-induced escape of bistable elements, which is the escape
from an attracting state driven by a fluctuation in the system's state. We
consider a system of interacting bistable elements and investigate the effect
of diffusive coupling among elements on the process of noise-induced escape. We
focus on the influence of the coupling strength over the escape time, which is
the time it takes for noise-induced escape to occur. We performed numerical
simulations and observed that weak coupling reduced the mean escape time,
whereas strong coupling impeded escape. We argue that, although diffusive
coupling both facilitates and impedes escape, the facilitating effect is
dominant when coupling is weak. For weak coupling cases, we develop an
approximate theory that can predict the mean and variance of escape times. In
contrast, strong coupling reduces the effective noise intensity to impede
escape. Our results suggest that diffusive coupling among multistable elements
contributes to regulating the rate of transitions among attracting states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10489v1

population growth after successive warming events, with generalist species
demonstrating greater growth across all regions analyzed. The comparatively

rise and climate change. A key metric for evaluating transportation system
degradation is accessibility, yet the lack of temporally and spatially
disaggregate data means that the impact of recurrent flooding on accessibility,

crowdsourced WAZE flood incident data from the Hampton Roads region in
Virginia, this study (Part 1) examines changes in the roadway network
accessibility for travelers residing in 1,113 traffic analysis zones (TAZs)
across five time of day periods. Additionally, a social vulnerability index
framework is developed to understand the socioeconomic characteristics of TAZs
that experience high accessibility reduction under recurrent flooding.
  Results show that TAZs experience the most accessibility reduction under
recurrent flooding during the morning peak period (6 to 9am) with large
differences across different zones, ranging from 0 to 49.6 (percentage) for
work trips (with population weighted mean reduction of 1.71 percent) and 0 to
87.9 (percentage) for nonwork trips (with population weighted mean reduction of
0.81 percent). Furthermore, the social vulnerability analysis showed that zones
with higher percentages of lower socioeconomic status, unemployed, less
educated, and limited English proficiency residents experience greater
accessibility reduction for work trips. In contrast to previous studies that
aggregate the effects of recurrent flooding across a city, these results
demonstrate that there exists large spatial and temporal variation in recurrent

patterns is essential. Recent evidence suggests that more than half of the
reefs surveyed across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) exhibit deviations from
standard recovery modelling assumptions when the initial coral cover is low
($\leq 10$\%). New modelling is necessary to account for these observed
patterns to better inform management strategies. We consider a new model for
reef recovery at the coral cover scale that accounts for biphasic recovery

for uncertainty quantification of key parameters for assessing reef health and

for the future period were analyzed at annual and seasonal scales using several
evaluation metrics, such as the delta changes of the atmospheric and land
variables, the runoff and evapotranspiration ratios of the overall water
balance, the snowmelt contribution to the total streamflow and the centroid
position for the daily hydrograph of the average hydrologic year. Annual
streamflow reductions of up to 40% were attained in various parts of the basin
for 2071-2100 under RCP8.5 scenario, and resulted from the precipitation
decreases in the southern subwatersheds and the combined effect of the
precipitation decreases and evapotranspiration increases in the north. The
runoff and the evapotranspiration ratios evinced a tendency towards an
evaporative regime in the north part of the basin and a strengthening of the
evaporative response in the south. Seasonal streamflow changes were mostly
negative and dependent on the season considered, with greater detriments in
spring and summer, and less intense ones in autumn and winter. The snowmelt
contribution to the total streamflow was strongly diminished with decreases
reaching -80% in autumn and spring, thus pointing to a change in the snow
regime for the Duero mountains. Finally, the annual and seasonal changes of the

which are prime targets for characterisation. We introduce a parametrised
cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven
breakup, which we couple with the 1D `radiative-convective' atmospheric model

wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on

that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term
changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor $>10$ enhancement in
H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ abundances, and atmospheric opacity more generally, and the

VegeDiff: Latent Diffusion Model for Geospatial Vegetation Forecasting,2024-07-17T14:15:52Z,"Sijie Zhao, Hao Chen, Xueliang Zhang, Pengfeng Xiao, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang","In the context of global climate change and frequent extreme weather events,
forecasting future geospatial vegetation states under these conditions is of
significant importance. The vegetation change process is influenced by the
complex interplay between dynamic meteorological variables and static
environmental variables, leading to high levels of uncertainty. Existing
deterministic methods are inadequate in addressing this uncertainty and fail to
accurately model the impact of these variables on vegetation, resulting in
blurry and inaccurate forecasting results. To address these issues, we propose
VegeDiff for the geospatial vegetation forecasting task. To our best knowledge,
VegeDiff is the first to employ a diffusion model to probabilistically capture
the uncertainties in vegetation change processes, enabling the generation of

the global impact of dynamic meteorological variables and the local effects of
static environmental variables, thus accurately modeling the impact of these

demonstrate the effectiveness of VegeDiff. By capturing the uncertainties in
vegetation changes and modeling the complex influence of relevant variables,
VegeDiff outperforms existing deterministic methods, providing clear and

Social bots sour activist sentiment without eroding engagement,2024-03-19T16:58:45Z,"Linda Li, Orsolya Vasarhelyi, Balazs Vedres","Social media platforms have witnessed a substantial increase in social bot
activity, significantly affecting online discourse. Our study explores the
dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change
protests from 18 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. We find that bots exert a
greater influence on human behavior than vice versa during heated online
periods. To assess the causal impact of human-bot communication, we compared
communication histories between human users who directly interacted with bots
and matched human users who did not. Our findings demonstrate a consistent
negative impact of bot interactions on subsequent human sentiment, with exposed
users displaying significantly more negative sentiment than their counterparts.
Furthermore, the nature of bot interaction influences human tweeting activity
and the sentiment towards protests. Political astroturfing bots increase
activity, whereas other bots decrease it. Sentiment changes towards protests
depend on the user's original support level, indicating targeted manipulation.
However, bot interactions do not change activists' engagement towards protests.
Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative
effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings
underscore the importance of unrestricted access to social media data for
studying the prevalence and influence of social bots, as with new technological
advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes nearly impossible.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12904v1
"Tropical cyclone genesis potential using a ventilated potential
  intensity",2024-04-02T02:07:13Z,"Daniel R Chavas, Suzana J Camargo, Michael K Tippett","Genesis potential indices (GPIs) are widely used to understand the
climatology of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, the sign of projected future
changes depends on how they incorporate environmental moisture. Recent theory
combines potential intensity and mid-tropospheric moisture into a single
quantity called the ventilated potential intensity, which removes this
ambiguity. This work proposes a new GPI ($GPI_v$) that is proportional to the
product of the ventilated potential intensity and the absolute vorticity raised
to a power. This power is estimated to be approximately 5 by fitting observed
tropical cyclone best-track and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data. Fitting the
model with separate exponents yields nearly identical values, indicating that
their product likely constitutes a single joint parameter. Likewise, results
are nearly identical for a Poisson model as for the power law. $GPI_v$ performs
comparably well to existing indices in reproducing the climatological
distribution of tropical cyclone genesis and its covariability with El
Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, while only requiring a single fitting exponent.
When applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
projections, $GPI_v$ predicts that environments globally will become gradually
more favorable for TC genesis with warming, consistent with prior work based on
the normalized entropy deficit, though significant changes emerge only at
higher latitudes under relatively strong warming. $GPI_v$ helps resolve the
debate over the treatment of the moisture term and its implication for changes
in TC genesis favorability with warming, and its clearer physical
interpretation may offer a step forward towards a theory for genesis across
climate states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01572v1

Deep Learning for predicting rate-induced tipping,2024-09-11T19:40:57Z,"Yu Huang, Sebastian Bathiany, Peter Ashwin, Niklas Boers","Nonlinear dynamical systems exposed to changing forcing can exhibit
catastrophic transitions between alternative and often markedly different
states. The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) can be used to anticipate
such transitions if caused by a bifurcation and if the change in forcing is
slow compared to the internal time scale of the system. However, in many
real-world situations, these assumptions are not met and transitions can be
triggered because the forcing exceeds a critical rate. For example, given the
pace of anthropogenic climate change in comparison to the internal time scales
of key Earth system components, such as the polar ice sheets or the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation, such rate-induced tipping poses a severe
risk. Moreover, depending on the realisation of random perturbations, some
trajectories may transition across an unstable boundary, while others do not,
even under the same forcing. CSD-based indicators generally cannot distinguish
these cases of noise-induced tipping versus no tipping. This severely limits
our ability to assess the risks of tipping, and to predict individual
trajectories. To address this, we make a first attempt to develop a deep
learning framework to predict transition probabilities of dynamical systems
ahead of rate-induced transitions. Our method issues early warnings, as
demonstrated on three prototypical systems for rate-induced tipping, subjected
to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise perturbations. Exploiting
explainable artificial intelligence methods, our framework captures the
fingerprints necessary for early detection of rate-induced tipping, even in
cases of long lead times. Our findings demonstrate the predictability of
rate-induced and noise-induced tipping, advancing our ability to determine safe
operating spaces for a broader class of dynamical systems than possible so far.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07590v1
Super Resolution On Global Weather Forecasts,2024-09-17T19:07:13Z,"Lawrence Zhang, Adam Yang, Rodz Andrie Amor, Bryan Zhang, Dhruv Rao","Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from
planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling
weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable
nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence
the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly
lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical
forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic
techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such
forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely
computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns
change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to
update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep
learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying
learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The
current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the
industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice
due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep
learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global
weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super
resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global
precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately

the co-evolution of land, water, and energy sectors under different future

particular outcomes. The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth

Unified Momentum Model for Rotor Aerodynamics Across Operating Regimes,2024-01-17T22:27:24Z,"Jaime Liew, Kirby S. Heck, Michael F. Howland","Despite substantial growth in wind energy technology in recent decades,
aerodynamic modeling of wind turbines relies on momentum models derived in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, which are well-known to break down under
flow regimes in which wind turbines often operate. This gap in theoretical
modeling for rotors that are misaligned with the inflow and also for
high-thrust rotors has resulted in the development of numerous empirical
corrections which are widely applied in textbooks, research articles, and
open-source and industry design codes. This work reports a unified momentum
model to efficiently predict power production, thrust force, and wake dynamics
of rotors under arbitrary inflow angles and thrust coefficients without
empirical corrections. This unified momentum model can form a new basis for

Mid-latitude interactions expand the Hadley circulation,2024-05-04T21:52:52Z,"W. Moon, J. S. Wettlaufer","The Hadley circulation describes a planetary-scale tropical atmospheric flow,

is based upon angular momentum conservation, the basic dynamical constraint
governing the state of the flow pattern. However, despite the degree of success
in representing the Hadley circulation, the canonical theoretical model does
not treat interactions with other regions, particularly the mid-latitudes.
Here, we extend the original model of Held and Hou (1980) to include the
influence of mid-latitude large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which we treat
using the planetary-scale heat equation with a parameterized poleward heat flux
driven by synoptic eddies. The energy flux balance within the Hadley cell
includes the poleward heat flux at the poleward edge of the cell, which is
controlled by the baroclinic instability of the sub-tropical jet. We find that
an increase (decrease) in the poleward heat flux leads to a strengthening

dominated by fossil fuels can substantially raise domestic electricity prices,
if green hydrogen production is not regulated. Surprisingly, temporal matching
of hydrogen production lowers domestic electricity cost by up to 31% while the
effect on exporters is minimal. This policy instrument can steer the welfare

The Merit of River Network Topology for Neural Flood Forecasting,2024-05-30T08:45:45Z,"Nikolas Kirschstein, Yixuan Sun","Climate change exacerbates riverine floods, which occur with higher frequency
and intensity than ever. The much-needed forecasting systems typically rely on
accurate river discharge predictions. To this end, the SOTA data-driven
approaches treat forecasting at spatially distributed gauge stations as
isolated problems, even within the same river network. However, incorporating
the known topology of the river network into the prediction model has the
potential to leverage the adjacency relationship between gauges. Thus, we model
river discharge for a network of gauging stations with GNNs and compare the
forecasting performance achieved by different adjacency definitions. Our
results show that the model fails to benefit from the river network topology
information, both on the entire network and small subgraphs. The learned edge
weights correlate with neither of the static definitions and exhibit no regular
pattern. Furthermore, the GNNs struggle to predict sudden, narrow discharge
spikes. Our work hints at a more general underlying phenomenon of neural
prediction not always benefitting from graphical structure and may inspire a
systematic study of the conditions under which this happens.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19836v1

Carbon Market Simulation with Adaptive Mechanism Design,2024-06-12T05:08:51Z,"Han Wang, Wenhao Li, Hongyuan Zha, Baoxiang Wang","A carbon market is a market-based tool that incentivizes economic agents to
align individual profits with the global utility, i.e., reducing carbon
emissions to tackle climate change. Cap and trade stands as a critical
principle based on allocating and trading carbon allowances (carbon emission
credit), enabling economic agents to follow planned emissions and penalizing
excess emissions. A central authority is responsible for introducing and
allocating those allowances in cap and trade. However, the complexity of carbon
market dynamics makes accurate simulation intractable, which in turn hinders
the design of effective allocation strategies. To address this, we propose an
adaptive mechanism design framework, simulating the market using hierarchical,

allocate carbon credits, while enterprises engage in economic activities and
carbon trading. This framework illustrates agents' behavior comprehensively.

the stationary assumption is a significant challenge. In practice, this
challenge is common in many areas, such as retail sales, transportation

"Efficient fine-tuning of 37-level GraphCast with the Canadian global
  deterministic analysis",2024-08-26T19:16:08Z,Christopher Subich,"This work describes a process for efficiently fine-tuning the GraphCast
data-driven forecast model to simulate another analysis system, here the Global
Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) of Environment and Climate Change Canada
(ECCC). Using two years of training data (July 2019 -- December 2021) and 37
GPU-days of computation to tune the 37-level, quarter-degree version of
GraphCast, the resulting model significantly outperforms both the unmodified
GraphCast and operational forecast, showing significant forecast skill in the
troposphere over lead times from 1 to 10 days. This fine-tuning is accomplished
through abbreviating DeepMind's original training curriculum for GraphCast,
relying on a shorter single-step forecast stage to accomplish the bulk of the
adaptation work and consolidating the autoregressive stages into separate 12hr,
1d, 2d, and 3d stages with larger learning rates. Additionally, training over
3d forecasts is split into two sub-steps to conserve host memory while
maintaining a strong correlation with training over the full period.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14587v1

  Wildfire",2024-08-28T13:12:28Z,"Muhammad Waseem, Arash F. Soofi, Saeed D. Manshadi","Wildfires and other extreme weather conditions due to climate change are
stressing the aging electrical infrastructure. Power utilities have implemented
public safety power shutoffs as a method to mitigate the risk of wildfire by
proactively de-energizing some power lines, which leaves customers without

power lines to avoid the wildfire risk and energizing those lines to serve the
demand. In this work, with a quantified wildfire ignition risk of each line, a
resilient operation problem is presented in power systems with a high
penetration level of renewable generation resources. A two-stage robust
optimization problem is formulated and solved using column-and-constraint

the conditional predictive distributions, it is hard to find where this theory
has been applied. Here the theory is reviewed, and applied to identifying
useful predictive variables for simultaneous multiseason prediction of

  complex system models",2024-09-06T07:14:14Z,"Daniel Pals, Sebastian Bathiany, Richard Wood, Niklas Boers","Numerical models of complex systems like the Earth system are expensive to
run and involve many uncertain and typically hand-tuned parameters. In the
context of anthropogenic climate change, there is particular concern that
specific tipping elements, like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation, might be overly stable in models due to imperfect parameter
choices. However, estimates of the critical forcing thresholds are highly
uncertain because the parameter spaces can practically not be explored. Here,
we introduce a method for efficient, systematic, and objective calibration of

"Managing Basis Risks in Weather Parametric Insurance: A Quantitative
  Study of Diversification and Key Influencing Factors",2024-09-25T03:53:45Z,"Hang Gao, Shuohua Yang, Xinli Liu","Weather parametric insurance relies on weather indices rather than actual
loss assessments, enhancing claims efficiency, reducing moral hazard, and
improving fairness. In the context of increasing climate change risks, despite
growing interest and demand,, weather parametric insurance's market share
remains limited due to inherent basis risk, which is the mismatch between
actual loss and payout, leading to loss without payout or payout without loss.
This paper proposes a novel empirical research using Monte Carlo simulations to
test whether basis risk can be managed through diversification and hedged like
other risks. Key findings include: Firstly, portfolio basis risk and volatility
decrease as the number of contracts increases. Secondly, spatial relationships
significantly impact basis risk, with risk levels correlating with the ratio
between insured location, weather station, and disaster footprint radius, and
thirdly, event severity does not significantly impact basis risk, suggesting
that catastrophic disaster severity should not hinder parametric insurance

is representative of applied uses of pre-trained models more generally. Through
extensive tests of different multi-temporal input schemes across diverse model

environmental conditions trigger a sudden shift to a new, potentially
catastrophic state. Early warning signals for these events are crucial for
decision-making in fields such as ecology, biology and climate science. Generic
early warning signals motivated by dynamical systems theory have had mixed
success on real noisy data. More recent studies found that deep learning
classifiers trained on synthetic data could improve performance. However,
neither of these methods take advantage of historical, system-specific data.
Here, we introduce an approach that trains machine learning classifiers
directly on surrogate data of past transitions, namely surrogate data-based
machine learning (SDML). The approach provides early warning signals in
empirical and experimental data from geology, climatology, sociology, and
cardiology with higher sensitivity and specificity than two widely used generic
early warning signals -- variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Since the approach
is trained directly on surrogates of historical data, it is not bound by the

concern: wanting to be perceived as talented, which implies being able to
distinguish proper from fake news, and wanting to signal one's worldview. Our
model can rationalize the empirical finding that fake news may be shared with a

flood detection model that leverages the cloud-penetrating capabilities of
Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery, enabling
consistent flood extent mapping in any weather condition. By applying this

flood-prone areas in Ethiopia and demonstrate real-time disaster response
capabilities during the May 2024 floods in Kenya. Additionally, our
longitudinal analysis reveals potential increasing trends in global flood

cointegrated with rank three and identify anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions as the

three cointegrated relations correspond to the physical relations that the

collective artificial learning is understudied, with today's machine learning
paradigms commonly favoring homogeneous agent strategies over heterogeneous
ones, mainly due to computational considerations. In this work, we employ
diversity measurement and control paradigms to study the impact of behavioral

unbiased behavioral roles that improve team outcomes; how behavioral diversity
synergizes with morphological diversity; how diverse agents are more effective
at finding cooperative solutions in sparse reward settings; and how
behaviorally heterogeneous teams learn and retain latent skills to overcome

critical for NASA-JPL's tsunami detection, real-time operations, and

steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic
features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative
Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs)

and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics,
Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while
preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further
retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART
datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic
properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved
robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting
high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the

cumulative travel disruption effects are not well understood. In Part 1 of this
study, the accessibility impacts of recurrent flooding on the auto mode were
examined. In this paper (Part 2 of the study), the impact of recurrent flooding
on transit service accessibility was quantified with the aid of spatially and
temporally disaggregated crowdsourced flood incident data from WAZE. A fixed
route transit network is built for five time of day periods for 710 traffic
analysis zones (TAZs), to capture the spatial and temporal variation of transit
accessibility reduction due to recurrent flooding. Results show that the
greatest transit accessibility reduction occurs during the morning peak hour,

indicates that TAZs with a greater share of people with higher vulnerability in
transportation and socioeconomic status are more likely to experience recurrent
flooding-induced transit accessibility reduction. Results from this study
reinforce the notion that transportation impacts under recurrent flooding are

  climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system",2024-03-05T17:58:32Z,"Philip David Kennedy, Abhirup Banerjee, Armin Köhl, Detlef Stammer","A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for chaotic climate models
is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This approach aims to optimise an
Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising an adjoint
model of a different, potentially simpler ESM. The technique relies on
synchronisation of the model to observed time series data employing the
dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) method to stabilise the tangent
linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values.
Therefore, long windows can be used to improve parameter estimation. In this
new extension a second layer of synchronisation is added between the two
models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the
trajectory of the model without an adjoint. The method is conceptually
demonstrated by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, representing two ESMs,
one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an
idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in
which they differ from one another. If employed with a coarser ESM with an
adjoint, the method will save computational power as only one forward run with
the full ESM per iteration needs to be carried out. It is demonstrated that
there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the 'traditional'
optimisation of full ESM with an adjoint. In a variation of the method
outlined, synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter
noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by
approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for
seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166v3

engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range
scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood,
physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate
simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible,
particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the
quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven
modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of
high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such
models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon
simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions
generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately
captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural
network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations
of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing
correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a
high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the
underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data,
even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through
the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the
uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation
capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of

temperature structure, and albedo of the substellar atmosphere. The properties
of clouds are governed by complex microphysics but these complexities are often
not captured by the simpler parameterized cloud models used in climate models
or retrieval models. Here, we combine microphysical cloud modeling and 1D
climate modeling to incorporate insights from microphysical models into a
self-consistent, parameterized cloud model. Using the 1D Community Aerosol and
Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), we generate microphysical water clouds
and compare their properties with those from the widely-used EddySed cloud
model (Ackerman & Marley 2001) for a grid of Y dwarfs. We find that the mass of
water condensate in our CARMA water clouds is significantly limited by
available condensation nuclei; in models without additional seed particles for
clouds added, the atmosphere becomes supersaturated. We incorporate water
latent heat release in the convective and radiative parts of the atmosphere and
find no significant impact on water-ice cloud formation for typical gas giant
compositions. Our analysis reveals the CARMA cloud profiles have a gradual
decrease in opacity of approximately 4% per bar below the cloud base.
Incorporating this gradual cloud base falloff and a variable $f_{sed}$

as plants are usually darker than the bare surface of the continents. We
updated ESTM (Earth-like Surface Temperature Model) to incorporate the
presence, distribution and evolution of two dynamically competing vegetation
types that resemble grasslands and trees (the latter in the double stages of
life: adults and seedlings). The newly developed model was applied to estimate
how the climate-vegetation system reaches equilibrium across different rocky
planetary configurations, and to assess its impact on temperature and
habitability. With respect to a world with bare granite continents, the effect
of vegetation-albedo feedback is to increase the average surface temperature.
Since grasses and trees exhibit different albedos, they affect temperature to
different degrees. The ultimate impact on climate depends on the outcome of the
competition between these vegetation types. The change in albedo due to
vegetation extends the habitable zone and enhances the overall planetary
habitability beyond its traditional outer edge. This effect is especially
relevant for planets that have a larger extension of continents than Earth. For
Earth, the semi-major axis d = 1.04 UA represents the turning point where
vegetation enhances habitability from h = 0.0 to h = 0.485 (in the
grass-dominance case), to h = 0.584 (in the case of coexistence between grasses
and trees), and to h = 0.612 (in the tree-dominance case). This illustrates the

gap by investigating the relationship between aviation-induced contrails, as
observed in Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite imagery, and their
impact on radiative forcing (RF) over a two-week study. Results show that while
daytime contrails generally have a cooling effect, the higher number of

the early Late Triassic that significantly affected marine ecosystems and
carbon cycles. One of the most prominent features of the CPE is the coupled
multiple negative carbonate-organic carbon isotope excursions. However, at
Erguan and Xiashulao from eastern Tethys, a decoupling between
carbonate-organic carbon isotope during CPE was observed. At the end of early
Carnian (Julian), the carbonate carbon isotope showed a negative excursion of
2-3 per-mille, while the organic carbon isotope exhibited a positive excursion
of about 3-4 per-mille. In addition, increased terrestrial inputs is indicated
by the rising C/N (3 to 10) and decreasing Y/Ho (42 to 27) that coexist with
this decoupling. The coupling of carbon isotope negative excursions is from the
shallow shelves and the deep slopes, whereas the decoupling occurs from the
deep shelf to the shallow slope. In the deep shelf to the shallow slope,
sedimentary organic matter is mainly sourced from pelagic before the CPE as
evidenced by low C/N (3) and high Y/Ho (36-42). During the CPE, the increased
fresh water flux (Sr/Ba <1) enhanced terrestrial input in organic matter, which
may cause positive excursions in the carbon isotope record with elevated TOC

due to the intrinsic nonlinearities and non-stationarity of the process, even
with the use of the most advanced machine learning techniques. In this study, a
physics-informed machine learning-based approach is proposed to efficiently and
accurately simulate time-series wave runup. The methodology combines the
computational efficiency of the Surfbeat (XBSB) mode with the accuracy of the
nonhydrostatic (XBNH) mode of the XBeach model. Specifically, a conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) is used to map the image representation
of wave runup from XBSB to the corresponding image from XBNH. These images are
generated by first converting wave runup signals into time-frequency scalograms
and then transforming them into image representations. The cGAN model achieves
improved performance in image-to-image mapping tasks by incorporating
physics-based knowledge from XBSB. After training the model, the high-fidelity
XBNH-based scalograms can be predicted, which are then employed to reconstruct
the time-series wave runup using the inverse wavelet transform. The simulation

sector. Measures to decarbonize the building sector include energy retrofits
and the expansion of renewable, decentralized power generators and low-CO2 heat
generators. These measures thus change both the load and the generation of the
future energy supply concept. Considering the interactions of the changed
installed technologies on the building level and their influence on the
electrical grid infrastructure is necessary. The grid operator will remedy the
future congested grid states by grid expansion measures and pass on the costs
to the connected grid users, which in turn could influence their behaviour and
decisions. The aim of this work is a holistic analysis of the staggered
interactions of generation expansion and grid expansion for a future
decentralized energy supply concept conditioned by the expansion in the field
of self-generation. To enable the analysis of the interactions, a
multi-criteria optimization procedure for expansion and operation decisions at
the building level is combined with an approach to determine grid expansion. As
part of this work, the effect of an expansion of hosting capacity on the grid
charges and thus the decision-making behaviour was investigated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14371v1
Multi-layer diffusion model of photovoltaic installations,2024-08-19T11:20:52Z,Tomasz Weron,"Nowadays, harmful effects of climate change are becoming increasingly
apparent. A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from
non-renewable and often polluting sources. For this reason, the development of
renewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid
spread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to
energy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring
sustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we
propose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels. It is an
extension of the q-voter model that utilizes a multi-layer network structure.
The novelty is that both opinion dynamics and diffusion of innovation are
studied simultaneously on a multidimensional structure. The model is analyzed
using Monte Carlo simulations and the mean-field approximation. The impact of
parameters and specifications on the basic properties of the model is
discussed. Firstly, we show that for a certain range of parameters, innovation
always succeeds, regardless of the initial conditions. Secondly, that the
mean-field approximation gives qualitatively the same results as computer
simulations, even though it does not utilize knowledge of the network
structure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09904v3
Lévy walk of pions in heavy-ion collisions,2024-09-16T15:15:59Z,"Dániel Kincses, Márton Nagy, Máté Csanád","The process of L\'evy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed
random walks, plays a role in various phenomena, from chemical and
microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent
experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion
collisions. However, the theoretical interpretation supporting such findings is
still debated. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly
interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early
Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to hadronic matter.
In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic
freeze-out, when their momenta stop changing, and they freely transition toward
the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in
understanding the dynamics of the created matter and the interactions among its
constituents. In this paper, we introduce a three-dimensional analysis of the
spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such
collisions). Utilising Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we
show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length
distribution leading to L\'evy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that
simulated pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be
described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric L\'evy-stable
distribution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10373v2
"The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets I:
  Tidally-Locked exo-Earths",2024-09-17T13:03:42Z,"Felix Sainsbury-Martinez, Catherine Walsh, Greg Cooke","Impacts by rocky and icy bodies are thought to have played a key role in
shaping the composition of solar system objects, including the Earth's
habitability. Hence, it is likely that they play a similar role in exoplanetary
systems. We investigate how an icy cometary impact affects the atmospheric
chemistry, climate, and composition of an Earth-like, tidally-locked,
terrestrial exoplanet, a prime target in the search for a habitable exoplanet
beyond our solar system. We couple a cometary impact model which includes
thermal ablation and pressure driven breakup with the 3D Earth System Model
WACCM6/CESM2, and use this model to investigate the effects of the water and
thermal energy delivery associated with an $R=2.5$ km pure water ice cometary
impact on an Earth-like atmosphere. We find that water is the primary driver of
longer timescale changes to the atmospheric chemistry and composition by acting
as a source of opacity, cloud ice, and atmospheric hydrogen/oxygen. The water
opacity drives heating at $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ bar, and cooling below, due to a
decreased flux reaching the surface. The increase in atmospheric hydrogen and
oxygen also drives an increase in the abundance of hydrogen/oxygen rich
molecules, with the exception of ozone, whose column density decreases by
$\sim10\%$. These atmospheric changes are potentially observable for $\sim$ 1-2
years post-impact, particularly those associated with cloud ice scattering.
They also persist, albeit at a much reduced level, to our quasi-steady-state,
suggesting that sustained bombardment or multiple large impacts have the
potential to shape the composition and habitability of terrestrial exoplanets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11151v2

Soil organic carbon sequestration potential and policy optimization,2024-09-26T18:27:34Z,"Jacob Spertus, Philip Stark, Whendee Silver, Eric Slessarev","Land management could help mitigate climate change by sequestering
atmospheric carbon dioxide as soil organic carbon (SOC). The impact of a given
management change on the SOC content of a given volume of soil is generally
unknown, but is likely moderated by features of the land that collectively
determine its sequestration potential. To maximize sequestration, management
interventions should be preferentially applied to fields with the highest
sequestration potential and the lowest cost of application. We present a
design-based statistical framework for estimating sequestration potential,
average treatment effects, and optimal management policies from a randomized
experiment with baseline covariate information. We review the myriad and nested
sources of uncertainty that arise in this context and formalize the problem
using potential outcomes. We show that a particular regression estimator --
regressing field-level SOC on management indicators and their interactions with
covariates -- can help identify effective policies. The regression estimator
also gives asymptotically valid inference on average treatment effects under
the randomized design -- without modeling assumptions -- and can increase
precision and power compared to the difference-in-means $T$-test. We conclude
by discussing the saturation hypothesis in relation to sequestration potential,

characterized by significant interannual variability. In this study, the
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Global Deterministic Prediction
System is used to investigate the medium-range predictability of ozone and
weather throughout the anomalous polar ozone depletion events of 2020. The
system includes ozone assimilation and makes use of a prognostic ozone field
for the computation of heating rates. The ozone scheme uses simplified
photochemical modules to represent the impact of both gas-phase and
heterogeneous reactions throughout polar ozone depletion events. The study
shows that during the Boreal and Austral spring seasons, the predictability of
the total ozone column exceeds 10 days and is comparable to the predictability
of large-scale weather variables. It also demonstrates that over both polar
regions, the inclusion of ozone radiative coupling has a significant impact on
the temperature and wind distributions throughout the stratosphere. Over
Antarctica, the ozone coupled forecasts are systematically colder at all lead
times, which helps eliminate a temperature bias present in the model using
climatological ozone. The strength of the polar vortex also increases
significantly throughout the lower stratosphere, in better agreement with zonal
wind analyses. Over the Arctic the use of an ozone-interactive model also
produces significant changes in the temperature and wind forecasts, but the
impact on the quality of the weather forecasts is generally neutral. The study
shows the overall benefits of using ozone coupled models in the highly

  Forecasting model",2024-10-20T04:46:42Z,"Shirong Zheng, Shaobo Liu, Zhenhong Zhang, Dian Gu, Chunqiu Xia, Huadong Pang, Enock Mintah Ampaw","With the advancement of global climate change and sustainable development
goals, urban building energy consumption optimization and carbon emission
reduction have become the focus of research. Traditional energy consumption
prediction methods often lack accuracy and adaptability due to their inability
to fully consider complex energy consumption patterns, especially in dealing
with seasonal fluctuations and dynamic changes. This study proposes a hybrid
deep learning model that combines TRIZ innovation theory with GWO, SARIMA and
LSTM to improve the accuracy of building energy consumption prediction. TRIZ
plays a key role in model design, providing innovative solutions to achieve an
effective balance between energy efficiency, cost and comfort by systematically
analyzing the contradictions in energy consumption optimization. GWO is used to
optimize the parameters of the model to ensure that the model maintains high
accuracy under different conditions. The SARIMA model focuses on capturing
seasonal trends in the data, while the LSTM model handles short-term and
long-term dependencies in the data, further improving the accuracy of the

robust model that leverages the strengths of TRIZ and advanced deep learning
techniques, improving the accuracy of energy consumption predictions. Our

simulate, predict, and optimize the behavior of physical systems, with
applications that span manufacturing, healthcare, climate science, and more.
However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data
requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic
changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by
dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic
data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines
the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the
physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical

process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling
wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior
from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental
results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can
adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction
is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of
10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we
analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their
potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and

Cross Domain Early Crop Mapping using CropSTGAN,2024-01-15T00:27:41Z,"Yiqun Wang, Hui Huang, Radu State","Driven by abundant satellite imagery, machine learning-based approaches have
recently been promoted to generate high-resolution crop cultivation maps to
support many agricultural applications. One of the major challenges faced by
these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the
absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the ""direct transfer
strategy"" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other
regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately,
the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual
variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop
progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or
years. Despite recent efforts, such as the application of the deep adaptation
neural network (DANN) model structure in the deep adaptation crop
classification network (DACCN), to tackle the above cross-domain challenges,
their effectiveness diminishes significantly when there is a large
dissimilarity between the source and target regions. This paper introduces the
Crop Mapping Spectral-temporal Generative Adversarial Neural Network
(CropSTGAN), a novel solution for cross-domain challenges, that doesn't require
target domain labels. CropSTGAN learns to transform the target domain's
spectral features to those of the source domain, effectively bridging large
dissimilarities. Additionally, it employs an identity loss to maintain the
intrinsic local structure of the data. Comprehensive experiments across various
regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed
approach. In experiments, CropSTGAN is benchmarked against various
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Notably, CropSTGAN significantly outperforms
these methods in scenarios with large data distribution dissimilarities between

correlations between disjoint areas. We reformulate precipitation nowcasting as
a spatiotemporal graph sequence problem. Specifically, we propose Graph
Dual-stream Convolutional Attention Fusion, a novel extension of the graph
attention network. Our model's dual-stream design employs distinct attention
mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions, capturing their unique
dynamics. A gated fusion module integrates both streams, leveraging spatial and
temporal information for improved predictive accuracy. Additionally, our
framework enhances graph attention by directly processing three-dimensional
tensors within graph nodes, removing the need for reshaping. This capability
enables handling complex, high-dimensional data and exploiting higher-order
correlations between data dimensions. Depthwise-separable convolutions are also
incorporated to refine local feature extraction and efficiently manage
high-dimensional inputs. We evaluate our model using seven years of

Narratives of Collective Action in YouTube's Discourse on Veganism,2024-01-17T13:44:36Z,"Arianna Pera, Luca Maria Aiello","Narratives can be powerful tools for inspiring action on pressing societal
issues such as climate change. While social science theories offer frameworks
for understanding the narratives that arise within collective movements, these
are rarely applied to the vast data available from social media platforms,
which play a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing
collective action. This gap in the empirical evaluation of online narratives
limits our understanding of their relationship with public response. In this
study, we focus on plant-based diets as a form of pro-environmental action and
employ natural language processing to operationalize a theoretical framework of
moral narratives specific to the vegan movement. We apply this framework to
narratives found in YouTube videos promoting environmental initiatives such as
Veganuary, Meatless March, and No Meat May. Our analysis reveals that several
narrative types, as defined by the theory, are empirically present in the data.
To identify narratives with the potential to elicit positive public engagement,
we used text processing to estimate the proportion of comments supporting
collective action across narrative types. Video narratives advocating social
fight, whether through protest or through efforts to convert others to the
cause, are associated with a stronger sense of collective action in the
respective comments. These narrative types also demonstrate increased semantic
coherence and alignment between the message and public response, markers
typically associated with successful collective action. Our work offers new
insights into the complex factors that influence the emergence of collective
action, thereby informing the development of effective communication strategies

an open problem for improving humanity across domains ranging from climate
change to pandemic response. To shed light on how behavioral norms can resolve
the social dilemma of cooperation, here we present a formal mathematical model
of individuals' decision making under general social norms, encompassing a
variety of concerns and motivations an individual may have beyond simply
maximizing their own payoffs. Using the canonical game of the Prisoner's
Dilemma, we compare four different norms: compassion, universalizability,
reciprocity, and equity, to determine which social forces can facilitate the
evolution of cooperation, if any. We analyze our model through a variety of
limiting cases, including weak selection, low mutation, and large population
sizes. This is complemented by computer simulations of population dynamics via
a Fisher process, which confirm our theoretical results. We find that the first
two norms lead to the emergence of cooperation in a wide range of games, but
the latter two do not on their own. Due to its generality, our framework can be
used to investigate many more norms, as well as how norms themselves emerge and

extreme temperature (e.g., due to climate change) is particularly dangerous for
bee health. Anticipating such extremities would allow beekeepers to take early
preventive action. Thus, given sensor (temperature) time series data from
beehives, how can we find patterns and do forecasting? Forecasting is crucial
as it helps spot unexpected behavior and thus issue warnings to the beekeepers.
In that case, what are the right models for forecasting? ARIMA, RNNs, or
something else?
  We propose the EBV (Electronic Bee-Veterinarian) method, which has the
following desirable properties: (i) principled: it is based on a) diffusion
equations from physics and b) control theory for feedback-loop controllers;
(ii) effective: it works well on multiple, real-world time sequences, (iii)
explainable: it needs only a handful of parameters (e.g., bee strength) that
beekeepers can easily understand and trust, and (iv) scalable: it performs
linearly in time. We applied our method to multiple real-world time sequences,
and found that it yields accurate forecasting (up to 49% improvement in RMSE
compared to baselines), and segmentation. Specifically, discontinuities
detected by EBV mostly coincide with domain expert's opinions, showcasing our
approach's potential and practical feasibility. Moreover, EBV is scalable and
fast, taking about 20 minutes on a stock laptop for reconstructing two months
of sensor data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01902v1
"Intelligent Agricultural Greenhouse Control System Based on Internet of

agricultural greenhouse control system grounded in the amalgamation of the
Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. Through meticulous monitoring of
intrinsic environmental parameters within the greenhouse and the integration of
machine learning algorithms, the conditions within the greenhouse are aptly
modulated. The envisaged outcome is an enhancement in crop growth efficiency
and yield, accompanied by a reduction in resource wastage. In the backdrop of
escalating global population figures and the escalating exigencies of climate
change, agriculture confronts unprecedented challenges. Conventional
agricultural paradigms have proven inadequate in addressing the imperatives of
food safety and production efficiency. Against this backdrop, greenhouse
agriculture emerges as a viable solution, proffering a controlled milieu for
crop cultivation to augment yields, refine quality, and diminish reliance on
natural resources [b1]. Nevertheless, greenhouse agriculture contends with a
gamut of challenges. Traditional greenhouse management strategies, often
grounded in experiential knowledge and predefined rules, lack targeted
personalized regulation, thereby resulting in resource inefficiencies. The
exigencies of real-time monitoring and precise control of the greenhouse's
internal environment gain paramount importance with the burgeoning scale of
agriculture. To redress this challenge, the study introduces IoT technology and
machine learning algorithms into greenhouse agriculture, aspiring to institute
an intelligent agricultural greenhouse control system conducive to augmenting

climate change, food security and biodiversity loss. This expansion is largely
concentrated in so-called frontiers, defined here as places experiencing marked
transformations due to rapid resource exploitation. Understanding the
mechanisms shaping these frontiers is crucial for sustainability. Previous work
focused mainly on explaining how active frontiers advance, in particular into
tropical forests. Comparatively, our understanding of how frontiers emerge in
territories considered marginal in terms of agricultural productivity and
global market integration remains weak. We synthesize conceptual tools
explaining resource and land-use frontiers, including theories of land rent and
agglomeration economies, of frontiers as successive waves, spaces of
territorialization, friction, and opportunities, anticipation and expectation.
We then propose a new theory of frontier emergence, which identifies exogenous
pushes, legacies of past waves, and actors anticipations as key mechanisms by
which frontiers emerge. Processes of abnormal rent creation and capture and the
built-up of agglomeration economies then constitute key mechanisms sustaining
active frontiers. Finally, we discuss five implications for the governance of
frontiers for sustainability. Our theory focuses on agriculture and
deforestation frontiers in the tropics, but can be inspirational for other

that LLMs could be used to promote a marginally more balanced footing among
decision makers in policy negotiations by assisting with certain tedious work,
particularly benefiting developing countries who face capacity constraints that
put them at a disadvantage in negotiations. However, the risks are particularly
concerning for environmental and marine policy uses, due to the urgency of
crises like climate change, high uncertainty, and trans-boundary impact.
  To explore the realistic potentials, limitations, and equity risks for LLMs
in marine policymaking, we present a case study of an AI chatbot for the
recently adopted Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (BBNJ),

the dangers of LLMs in marine policymaking via their potential bias towards
generating text that favors the perspectives of mainly Western economic centers

several ways these biases can enter the system, including: (1) biases in the
underlying foundational language models; (2) biases arising from the chatbot's
connection to UN negotiation documents, and (3) biases arising from the

assessed existing classification algorithms and proposed a new multi-label
method for automatically detecting coral conditions and extracting ecological

ensemble learning approach was proposed. The proposed method accurately
classified coral conditions as healthy, compromised, dead, and rubble; it also
identified corresponding stressors, including competition, disease, predation,
and physical issues. This method can help develop the coral image archive,
guide conservation activities, and provide references for decision-making for

Although El Ni\~no/ events in the equatorial Pacific make dry days and whole
summers more likely throughout India, their influence on daily extremes is not

Conversely, extremes are broadly suppressed in the drier southeast and far

data on the temporal evolution of water composition, and a few provide
identification of secondary precipitates and their compositions, offering
empirical and semi-quantitative information about the reactivity of basalts and
the likelihood of secondary carbonate mineralization at various temperatures,

multi-sink inverse mass balance problem with insufficient constraints on the
bulk system in which the temporal evolution of major ions does not provide

influence on global climate. There is much debate about whether the current
strong AMOC may collapse as a result of anthropogenic forcing and/or internal
variability. Increasing the noise in simple salt-advection models can change
the apparent AMOC tipping threshold. However, it's not clear if 'present-day'
variability is strong enough to induce a collapse. Here, we investigate how
internal variability affects the likelihood of AMOC collapse. We examine
internal variability of basin-scale salinities and temperatures in four CMIP6

model, and find that noise-induced AMOC collapse (defined as a decade in which
the mean AMOC strength falls below 5 Sv) is unlikely for pre-industrial CMIP6
variability unless external forcing shifts the AMOC closer to a threshold.
However, CMIP6 models seem to underestimate present-day Atlantic Ocean
variability, and stronger variability substantially increases the likelihood of
noise-induced collapse, especially if forcing brings the AMOC close to a
stability threshold. Surprisingly, we find a case where forcing temporarily
overshoots a stability threshold but noise decreases the probability of
collapse. Accurately modelling internal decadal variability is essential for
understanding the increased uncertainty in AMOC projections.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10929v2

ash species will be exacerbated in the near future by westward expansion of the
emerald ash borer and climate change, systematic conservation frameworks need
to be developed to avoid long-term population-genetic consequences and
depletion of genomic diversity. In this article, we address the advantages and
obstacles of conservation approaches aiming to conserve genetic diversity
in-situ or ex-situ during tree pandemics. We are reviewing 47 studies which
were published on ash dieback to unravel three important dimensions of ongoing
conservation approaches or perceived conservation problems: i) conservation
philosophy (i.e. natural selection, resistance breeding or genetic
conservation), ii) the spatial scale (ecosystem, country, continent), and iii)
the integration of genetic safety margins in conservation planning. Although
nearly equal proportions of the reviewed studies mention breeding or active
conservation as possible long-term solutions, only 17% consider that additional
threats exist which may further reduce genetic diversity in both ash species.
We also identify and discuss several knowledge gaps and limitations which may
have limited the initiation of conservation projects at national and

imagery analysis. To train and evaluate our system, we employ a dataset
consisting of 400 original underwater images. We increased the number of
annotated images to 580 through image manipulation using data augmentation
techniques, which can improve the model's performance by providing more diverse
examples for training. The dataset is carefully collected from underwater
videos that capture various coral reef environments, species, and lighting
conditions. Our system leverages the YOLOv5 algorithm's real-time object
detection capabilities, enabling efficient and accurate coral detection. We
used YOLOv5 to extract discriminating features from the annotated dataset,
enabling the system to generalize, including previously unseen underwater
images. The successful implementation of the automatic coral detection system
with YOLOv5 on our original image dataset highlights the potential of advanced
computer vision techniques for coral reef research and conservation. Further
research will focus on refining the algorithm to handle challenging underwater
image conditions, and expanding the dataset to incorporate a wider range of
coral species and spatio-temporal variations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14879v1

food production is critical. Marine aquaculture offers a viable solution,
providing a sustainable protein source. However, the industry's expansion
requires novel technologies for remote management and autonomous operations.
Digital twin technology can advance the aquaculture industry, but its adoption
has been limited. Fish net cages, which are flexible floating structures, are
critical yet vulnerable components of aquaculture farms. Exposed to harsh and
dynamic marine environments, the cages experience significant loads and risk
damage, leading to fish escapes, environmental impacts, and financial losses.
We propose a multifidelity surrogate modeling framework for integration into a
digital twin for real-time monitoring of aquaculture net cage structural
dynamics under stochastic marine conditions. Central to this framework is the
nonlinear autoregressive Gaussian process method, which learns complex,
nonlinear cross-correlations between models of varying fidelity. It combines
low-fidelity simulation data with a small set of high-fidelity field sensor
measurements, which offer the real dynamics but are costly and spatially
sparse. Validated at the SINTEF ACE fish farm in Norway, our digital twin
receives online metocean data and accurately predicts net cage displacements
and mooring line loads, aligning closely with field measurements. The proposed
framework is beneficial where application-specific data are scarce, offering
rapid predictions and real-time system representation. The developed digital
twin prevents potential damages by assessing structural integrity and
facilitates remote operations with unmanned underwater vehicles. Our work also
compares GP and GCNs for predicting net cage deformation, highlighting the

the harvest value in wine using structured and unstructured open data sources.
With climate change and new environmental and ecological policies, wine
producers are facing new challenges. The ability to model the evolution of
these risks is strategic for wine producers and research in order to adapt.
Many research projects require the values exposed to risk. For example, to
assess the economic impact of risks or the premium of crop insurance, or to
choose between different agroecological solutions in a cost-benefit approach.
The high spatial heterogeneity and complexity of wine characteristics add to
the challenge of these production values and the need to improve our spatial

several techniques available to merge, combine or complete missing data. We
have chosen to use optimization methods to re-estimate the area by appellation

Climate change analysis from LRD manifold functional regression,2024-06-29T09:29:47Z,"Diana P. Ovalle-Muñoz, M. Dolores Ruiz-Medina","This work is motivated by the problem of predicting downward solar radiation
flux spherical maps from the observation of atmospheric pressure at high cloud

reduces uncertainty in the support of this operator. An additive long-memory
manifold-supported functional time series error models persistence in time of
random fluctuations observed in the response. Time is incorporated via the
scalar covariates in the latent linear functional regression model. The
functional regression parameters in this model are supported on a connected and

platforms often facilitate such tendencies of homophily and echo-chambers as
they promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. However,
increased belief rigidity can negatively affect real-world policy decisions
such as leading to climate change inaction and increased vaccine hesitancy. To
understand and effectively tackle belief rigidity on online social networks,
designing and evaluating various intervention strategies is crucial, and
increasing randomization in the network can be considered one such
intervention. In this paper, we empirically quantify the effects of a
randomized social network structure on belief rigidity, specifically examining
the potential benefits of introducing randomness into the network. We show that
individuals' beliefs are positively influenced by peer opinions, regardless of
whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own by passively
sensing belief rigidity through our experimental framework. Moreover, people
incorporate a slightly higher variety of different peers (based on their
opinions) into their networks when the recommendation algorithm provides them
with diverse content, compared to when it provides them with similar content.
Our results indicate that in some cases, there might be benefits to
randomization, providing empirical evidence that a more randomized network

Dynamics of Heatwave Intensification over the Indian Region,2024-07-05T04:58:04Z,"Lekshmi S, Rajib Chattopadhyay, D. S. Pai","In a warming world, heatwaves over India have become intense and are causing
severe health impacts. Studies have identified the presence of amplified Rossby
waves and their association with the intensification of heatwaves. Earlier
studies have identified two dominant modes of temperature variability in India
and their possible role in the development of dry (mode 1) and moist (mode 2)
heatwaves. These modes are associated with midlatitude Rossby waves intruding
over the Indian region. However the role of regional forcing and the
teleconnection behind the intensification of the heatwaves over India is
missing. The present study has analyzed the dynamical mechanisms for the
regional intensification of the circulation features associated with the
dominant moist heatwave mode (mode 2). Considering the predominant barotropic
nature of the observed circulation features of the mode, a simple barotropic
vorticity equation model forced with extratropical and regional vorticity
sources is used to understand the intensification of the heat waves. It was
found that a wave response initiated by a cyclonic vorticity over the Bay of
Bengal superimposes with the mid-latitude anticyclonic vorticity generated
Rossby waves intruding over India. This superimposition results in the
amplification and persistence of the anticyclonic vorticity phase over the
Northwest Indian region, leading to the intensification of circulation. It was
also found that the barotropically forced intensified circulation leads to the
intensification of the heat stress. Under a climate change scenario, different
circulation regimes, characterized by zonal stationary wave number and jet
speed, which can favor the intensification are also identified.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04256v1

in this sector crucial for attaining global emission targets. Carbon sink
trading serves as a supplementary mechanism to achieve carbon peaking and
neutrality, helping to lower the rate ofcarbon emissions. However, practical
projects and research in the field of carbon sink trading are not enough
currently. This work aims to thoroughly explore the cooperative models between
farmers and retailers within the context of agricultural carbon sink trading,
as well as the optimal decisions on the efforts to reduce carbon emission for
both parties under different cooperative models. To this end, we delve into
three distinct cooperative frameworks: the decentralized, the Stackelberg, and
the centralized models, each accompanied by a corresponding differentialgame
model. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is utilized to investigate the
equilibrium strategies of each participant under these three cooperative
models, respectively. Furthermore, we conducte numerical simulations to analyze
the carbon emission reduction efforts of farmers and retailers, the carbon
emission reduction level of the agricultural supply chain, and the overall
profits of the supply chain. We also compare scenarios with and without carbon
sink trading to provide a comprehensive assessment. The numerical results
indicate that the centralized modelexcels in all aspects, followed by the
Stackelberg model, with the decentralized model showing the weakest
performance. Additionally, carbon sink trading can significantly increase the
profits of the participants under each cooperative model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05099v1

Aims: We constrain the properties and long-term (decade) behaviour of the
transiting dust cloud from the ""evaporating"" planet K2-22b. Methods: We
observed K2-22b around 40 predicted transits with MuSCAT ground-based
multi-optical channel imagers, and complemented these data with long-term
monitoring by the ground-based ATLAS (2018-2024) and space-based TESS

wavelength dependence indicates that dust grains are large or the cloud is
optically thick. Long-term trends of depth could be due to a magnetic cycle on
the host star or overturn of the planet's dayside surface magma ocean. The

A Stochastic Precipitating Quasi-Geostrophic Model,2024-07-30T15:01:25Z,"Nan Chen, Changhong Mou, Leslie M. Smith, Yeyu Zhang","Efficient and effective modeling of complex systems, incorporating cloud
physics and precipitation, is essential for accurate climate modeling and
forecasting. However, simulating these systems is computationally demanding
since microphysics has crucial contributions to the dynamics of moisture and
precipitation. In this paper, appropriate stochastic models are developed for
the phase-transition dynamics of water, focusing on the precipitating
quasi-geostrophic (PQG) model as a prototype. By treating the moisture, phase
transitions, and latent heat release as integral components of the system, the
PQG model constitutes a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that
involve Heaviside nonlinearities due to phase changes of water. Despite
systematically characterizing the precipitation physics, expensive iterative
algorithms are needed to find a PDE inversion at each numerical integration
time step. As a crucial step toward building an effective stochastic model, a
computationally efficient Markov jump process is designed to randomly simulate
transitions between saturated and unsaturated states that avoids using the
expensive iterative solver. The transition rates, which are deterministic, are
derived from the physical fields, guaranteeing physical and statistical
consistency with nature. Furthermore, to maintain the consistent spatial
pattern of precipitation, the stochastic model incorporates an adaptive
parameterization that automatically adjusts the transitions based on spatial
information. Numerical tests show the stochastic model retains critical
properties of the original PQG system while significantly reducing
computational demands. It accurately captures observed precipitation patterns,
including the spatial distribution and temporal variability of rainfall,
alongside reproducing essential dynamic features such as potential vorticity
fields and zonal mean flows.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20886v1

utilization. Among them, the conversion of CO2 with green H2 to sustainable
aviation fuel (SAF) with high energy density has gained much attention. It
offers a promising way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the fossil
fuel crises, and transform a climate killer into valuable products. However,
this low-carbon technology is intrinsically complicated. It involves the
development of a catalyst, the design of a reaction system, and its operation
and product refining. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical process
of CO2 hydrogenation in the reactor. In this study, numerical simulations of a
fixed bed catalytic reactor for CO2-to-SAF conversion are conducted by coupling
CFD with heterogeneous catalytic reactions at the catalytic surface. The heat
and mass transfer between the catalyst surface and surrounding fluid flow are
resolved in the simulation. A detailed understanding of the reacting flow and
catalytic processes is obtained from this study. The impact of operating
parameters, i.e., temperature, pressure, mass flow rate, and the ratio between

Penalized Likelihood Approach for the Four-parameter Kappa Distribution,2024-08-19T01:28:28Z,"Nipada Papukdee, Jeong-Soo Park, Piyapatr Busababodhin","The four-parameter kappa distribution (K4D) is a generalized form of some
commonly used distributions such as generalized logistic, generalized Pareto,
generalized Gumbel, and generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. Owing to
its flexibility, the K4D is widely applied in modeling in several fields such
as hydrology and climatic change. For the estimation of the four parameters,
the maximum likelihood approach and the method of L-moments are usually
employed. The L-moment estimator (LME) method works well for some parameter
spaces, with up to a moderate sample size, but it is sometimes not feasible in
terms of computing the appropriate estimates. Meanwhile, the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) is optimal for large samples and applicable to a very wide
range of situations, including non-stationary data. However, using the MLE of
K4D with small sample sizes shows substantially poor performance in terms of a
large variance of the estimator. We therefore propose a maximum penalized
likelihood estimation (MPLE) of K4D by adjusting the existing penalty functions
that restrict the parameter space. Eighteen combinations of penalties for two
shape parameters are considered and compared. The MPLE retains modeling
flexibility and large sample optimality while also improving on small sample
properties. The properties of the proposed estimator are verified through a
Monte Carlo simulation, and an application case is demonstrated taking
Thailand's annual maximum temperature data. Based on this study, we suggest
using combinations of penalty functions in general.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09631v1

Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will

to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations,
which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures.
Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the
complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for

global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and
local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors.
Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of

Water flow model on vegetated hillslopes with erosion,2024-08-22T15:06:18Z,"Stelian Ion, Dorin Marinescu, Stefan-Gicu Cruceanu","The water circulation in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum and particularly
the soil erosion induced by water are problems of main concern in the new era
of climate change. The present paper aims to provide a mathematical tool to
investigate the water-soil and water-plant interactions involved in the complex
process of water flow on plant-covered soil surfaces. Basically, the
mathematical model consists of an extended Saint-Venant system of equations for
water flow coupled with Hairsine-Rose equations for soil erosion. The classical
Saint-Venant model is thus modified in order to take into account the presence
of plants on the soil surface. On the premise that the model adequately
reflects the essence of the reality, a series of numerical experiments are
performed to analyze the plant induced effects on water dynamics and soil
erosion intensity.
  Given that both, the mathematical model and the accompanying software are
flexible enough to reflect the variability of the environmental variables such
as soil structure, soil surface roughness, or plant cover structure, each
numerical experiment is constructed as an image of a target hydrological
context. The dam break problem, flash floods, water-induced soil erosion in a
catchment basin are all subjects of numerical analysis. It is shown that the
presence of the plant cover drastically modifies the water dynamics and the
distribution of the soil eroded particles and one can quantitatively evaluate
such effects. The methods described in the paper can also help one to manage

Subsequently, a comprehensive set of criteria from the literature were

this work we first quantify the extreme temperature and precipitation events in
Brazil using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes
634 meteorological stations that have worked intermittently since 1961. We show
that the anomaly in temperature has increased by more than 1{\deg}C in the last

lacks a dense atmosphere. This line of thought is based on a prevailing theory
that magnetic fields can shield the atmosphere from solar wind erosion.
However, we present observations here to demonstrate a counterintuitive
understanding: unlike the global intrinsic magnetic field, the remnant crustal
magnetic fields can enhance atmosphere loss when considering loss induced by
plasma wave-particle interactions. An analysis of MAVEN data, combined with
observation-based simulations, reveals that the bulk of O+ ions would be in
resonance with ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves when the latter were present.
This interaction then results in significant particle energization, thus
enhancing ion escaping. A more detailed analysis attributes the occurrence of
the resonance to the presence of Mars' crustal magnetic fields, which cause the
majority of nearby ions to gyrate at a frequency matching the resonant
condition ({\omega}-k_{\parallel} v_{\parallel}={\Omega}_i) of the waves. The
ULF waves, fundamental drivers of this entire process, are excited and

25km x 25km grid. This high-quality sea ice forecasting can be utilized as
reliable guidance for the next stage. Subsequently, an unconditional diffusion

"Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models for Crop
  Production Process Management Optimization and Control through A New
  Knowledge-Based Deep Learning Paradigm",2024-10-13T00:31:16Z,"Dong Chen, Yanbo Huang","Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to
meet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing
environmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed
through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the
dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as
climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring
transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn
optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across
agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This
paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop
management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in
agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms,
their application within crop management, and the use of crop management
simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with
crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural
practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the
uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration
also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these
challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and
enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of
crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and
innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming
agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09680v1

  for Sustainable Streetscape Design",2024-10-12T04:03:36Z,"Sijie Yang, Adrian Chong, Pengyuan Liu, Filip Biljecki","In response to climate change and urban heat island effects, enhancing human
thermal comfort in cities is crucial for sustainable urban development.
Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and
corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive,
inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1)
introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalizes the
integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal
comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method
to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance -- VATA), which
combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and
statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image
features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for
streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic
net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend
thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with
field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and
transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban
streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially
explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for
long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and
inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This
framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and
resilient urban environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11887v4

"Hiformer: Hybrid Frequency Feature Enhancement Inverted Transformer for
  Long-Term Wind Power Prediction",2024-10-17T08:00:36Z,"Chongyang Wan, Shunbo Lei, Yuan Luo","The increasing severity of climate change necessitates an urgent transition
to renewable energy sources, making the large-scale adoption of wind energy
crucial for mitigating environmental impact. However, the inherent uncertainty
of wind power poses challenges for grid stability, underscoring the need for
accurate wind energy prediction models to enable effective power system
planning and operation. While many existing studies on wind power prediction
focus on short-term forecasting, they often overlook the importance of
long-term predictions. Long-term wind power forecasting is essential for
effective power grid dispatch and market transactions, as it requires careful
consideration of weather features such as wind speed and direction, which
directly influence power output. Consequently, methods designed for short-term
predictions may lead to inaccurate results and high computational costs in
long-term settings. To adress these limitations, we propose a novel approach
called Hybrid Frequency Feature Enhancement Inverted Transformer (Hiformer).
Hiformer introduces a unique structure that integrates signal decomposition
technology with weather feature extraction technique to enhance the modeling of
correlations between meteorological conditions and wind power generation.
Additionally, Hiformer employs an encoder-only architecture, which reduces the
computational complexity associated with long-term wind power forecasting.
Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, Hiformer: (i) can improve the

of climate change, with more intense and more volatile rainfall events.
Currently, state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are known
to struggle to produce skillful rainfall forecasts in tropical regions of
Africa. There is thus a pressing need for improved rainfall forecasting in
these regions. Over the last decade or so, the increased availability of
large-scale meteorological datasets and the development of powerful machine
learning models have opened up new opportunities for data-driven weather
forecasting. Focusing on Ghana in this study, we use these tools to develop two
U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) models, to predict 24h rainfall at 12h

interpretability. We developed a novel statistical methodology that allowed us
to probe the relative importance of the meteorological variables input in our
model, offering useful insights into the factors that drive precipitation in
the Ghana region. Empirically, we found that our 12h lead-time model has
performances that match, and in some accounts are better than the 18h lead-time

forecasting of battery degradation over both short and long time spans are
essential for optimizing performance, extending battery life, and ensuring

The role of edge states for early-warning of tipping points,2024-10-04T06:21:19Z,"Johannes Lohmann, Alfred B. Hansen, Alessandro Lovo, Ruth Chapman, Freddy Bouchet, Valerio Lucarini","Tipping points (TP) are often described as low-dimensional bifurcations, and
are associated with early-warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down
(CSD). CSD is an increase in amplitude and correlation of noise-induced
fluctuations away from a reference attractor as the TP is approached. But for
high-dimensional systems it is not obvious which variables or observables would
display the critical dynamics and carry CSD. Many variables may display no CSD,
or show changes in variability not related to a TP. It is thus helpful to
identify beforehand which observables are relevant for a given TP. Here we
propose this may be achieved by knowledge of an unstable edge state that
separates the reference from an alternative attractor that remains after the
TP. This is because stochastic fluctuations away from the reference attractor
are preferentially directed towards the edge state along a most likely path
(the instanton). As the TP is approached the edge state and reference attractor
typically become closer, and the fluctuations can evolve further along the
instanton. This can be exploited to find observables with substantial CSD,
which we demonstrate using conceptual dynamical systems models and climate
model simulations of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16277v2

  Adjoint model based study",2024-10-22T15:08:03Z,"Abhirup Banerjee, Armin Koehl, Frank Lunkeit, Detlef Stammer","Continental heatwaves can dramatically impact ecosystems and societies, e.g.,
by leading to excess mortality, wildfires, and harvest failures. With a warming
climate, their impacts potentially intensify globally, but the Indian
subcontinent appears to be particularly vulnerable to such extreme events. In
this study, we use reanalysis and the adjoint of the atmospheric model, PlaSim,
to identify drivers of heatwaves occurring April and May over north-central
India. Reanalysis results suggest that the existence of high temperatures in
the study region is highly sensitive to the low local soil moisture which is
observed weeks before a heatwave commences. Soil moisture variability in
northern India is influenced by moisture transport from the west during
winter--spring. Preceding dry soil moisture conditions can be associated with a
`persistent jet' conditions linked to atmospheric dynamical changes in the
North Atlantic region. An associated northward shift in the upper tropospheric
zonal wind occurs approximately a month prior to the heatwaves, influencing the
area and intensity of western disturbances embedded in the jet stream. This
weakens the moisture flow from the north of the Arabian Sea, further reducing
soil moisture levels and creating conditions conducive to heatwaves. An adjoint
sensitivity analysis and forward model perturbation experiments confirm the
causal relationships for the proposed heatwave development mechanism over
north-central India, identifying the remote influence of North Atlantic sea
surface temperature variability on extreme temperatures in India. Our findings
highlight the complex interplay of local and remote factors in heatwave
development over India.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17083v1

aboveground biomass and carbon stock dynamics, supporting ecosystem monitoring
services like timber provisioning, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity
conservation. However, despite advancements in spaceborne LiDAR technology,
data for northern high latitudes remain limited due to orbital and sampling
constraints. This study introduces a methodology for generating spatially
continuous, high-resolution canopy height and uncertainty estimates using Deep
Learning Regression models. We integrate multi-source, multi-seasonal satellite
data from Sentinel-1, Landsat, and ALOS-PALSAR-2, with spaceborne GEDI LiDAR as
reference data. Our approach was tested in Ontario, Canada, and validated with
airborne LiDAR, demonstrating strong performance. The best results were
achieved by incorporating seasonal Sentinel-1 and Landsat features alongside
PALSAR data, yielding an R-square of 0.72, RMSE of 3.43 m, and bias of 2.44 m.
Using seasonal data instead of summer-only data improved variability by 10%,
reduced error by 0.45 m, and decreased bias by 1 m. The deep learning model's
weighting strategy notably reduced errors in tall canopy height estimates
compared to a recent global model, though it overestimated lower canopy
heights. Uncertainty maps highlighted greater uncertainty near forest edges,
where GEDI measurements are prone to errors and SAR data may encounter
backscatter issues like foreshortening, layover, and shadow. This study
enhances canopy height estimation techniques in areas lacking spaceborne LiDAR
coverage, providing essential tools for forestry, environmental monitoring, and

However, largely due to the absence of granular spatiotemporal outage data, we
lack data-driven evidence and analytics-based metrics to quantify power system
vulnerability. This limitation has hindered the ability to effectively evaluate
and address vulnerability to power outages in US communities. Here, we
collected ~179 million power outage records at 15-minute intervals across 3022
US contiguous counties (96.15% of the area) from 2014 to 2023. We developed a
power system vulnerability assessment framework based on three dimensions
(intensity, frequency, and duration) and applied interpretable machine learning
models (XGBoost and SHAP) to compute Power System Vulnerability Index (PSVI) at
the county level. Our analysis reveals a consistent increase in power system
vulnerability over the past decade. We identified 318 counties across 45 states
as hotspots for high power system vulnerability, particularly in the West Coast
(California and Washington), the East Coast (Florida and the Northeast area),
the Great Lakes megalopolis (Chicago-Detroit metropolitan areas), and the Gulf
of Mexico (Texas). Heterogeneity analysis indicates that urban counties,
counties with interconnected grids, and states with high solar generation

surrogate framework that integrates the U-Net Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO)
with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ensemble Smoother with Multiple

seawater intrusion while significantly reducing uncertainty in model
predictions. We apply GeoFUSE to a 2D cross-section of the Beaver Creek tidal
stream-floodplain system in Washington State. Using 1,500 geological
realizations, we train the U-FNO surrogate model to approximate salinity
distribution and accumulation. The U-FNO model successfully reduces the
computational time from hours (using PFLOTRAN simulations) to seconds,
achieving a speedup of approximately 360,000 times while maintaining high
accuracy. By integrating measurement data from monitoring wells, the framework
significantly reduces geological uncertainty and improves the predictive
accuracy of the salinity distribution over a 20-year period. Our results
demonstrate that GeoFUSE improves computational efficiency and provides a

systems to flooding, while cyber threats and emerging technologies such as
unmanned aerial vehicles are exposing such systems to targeted disruptions. An
imperative has emerged to model how networked infrastructure systems fail and
devise strategies to efficiently recover from disruptions. Passenger flow
approaches can quantify more dimensions of resilience than network
science-based approaches, but the former typically requires granular data from

the subways of Boston, New York, and Osaka. Results show that centrality-based
strategies are most effective when measuring performance via GCC, while
centrality-ridership hybrid strategies perform strongest by HRCC. We show that

participation is still emerging. This study aims to identify potential CSA
participants in Japan and validate existing theories on CSA participation
through a quantitative analysis of 2,484 Japanese consumers. Using choice
experiments, Latent Class Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Modeling, we identified five distinct consumer segments. The
""Sustainable Food Seekers"" group showed the highest positive utility for CSA,
driven primarily by ""Food Education and Learning Opportunities"" and
""Contribution to Environmental and Social Issues."" These factors were
consistently significant across all segments, suggesting that many Japanese
consumers value CSA for its educational and environmental benefits. In
contrast, factors related to ""Variety of Ingredients"" were less influential in
determining participation intentions. The findings suggest that promoting CSA
in Japan may be most effective by emphasizing its role in environmental and
social impact, rather than focusing solely on product attributes like organic
certification, which is readily available in supermarkets. This reflects a key
distinction between CSA adoption in Japan and in other cultural contexts, where
access to organic produce is a primary driver. For ""Sustainable Food Seekers,""

methods have widely demonstrated strong competitiveness among the weather
forecasting systems. However, these methods are insufficient for
high-spatial-resolution short-term nowcasting within 6 hours, which is crucial
for warning short-duration, mesoscale and small-scale weather events.
Geostationary satellite remote sensing provides detailed, high spatio-temporal
and all-day observations, which can address the above limitations of existing
methods. Therefore, this paper proposed an advanced data-driven thermal
infrared cloud images forecasting model, ""DaYu."" Unlike existing data-driven
weather forecasting models, DaYu is specifically designed for geostationary
satellite observations, with a temporal resolution of 0.5 hours and a spatial
resolution of ${0.05}^\circ$ $\times$ ${0.05}^\circ$. DaYu is based on a
large-scale transformer architecture, which enables it to capture fine-grained
cloud structures and learn fast-changing spatio-temporal evolution features
effectively. Moreover, its attention mechanism design achieves a balance in
computational complexity, making it practical for applications. DaYu not only
achieves accurate forecasts up to 3 hours with a correlation coefficient higher
than 0.9, 6 hours higher than 0.8, and 12 hours higher than 0.7, but also
detects short-duration, mesoscale, and small-scale weather events with enhanced

"The role of Solar Activity in shaping Precipitation Extremes: A Regional
  Exploration in Kerala, India",2024-11-02T17:02:22Z,"Elizabeth Thomas, S. Vineeth, Noble P. Abraham","There has been global attention focused on extreme climatic changes. The
purpose of this paper is to explore the response of extreme precipitation
events to solar activity, over Kerala, India. The three solar indices - sunspot
number, F10.7 index, and cosmic ray intensity - are examined, and their
relationship to rainfall is examined during a 57-year period (1965 - 2021),
starting with Solar Cycle 20. Both solar and rainfall data are considered on an
annual scale as well as on a seasonal scale by dividing them into winter,
pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The solar indices are used to
calculate correlation coefficients with seasonal rainfall. Through correlation
analysis, it is found that the precipitation in Kerala is correlated with the
sunspot activity, but with different significance. When solar activity is high,
the winter and monsoon seasons exhibit strong correlations with high
significance. The solar influence at the regional level is also studied. The
central and southern parts of Kerala appear to be influenced by the Sun during
periods of high activity. The years with excess and deficiency of rainfall are
calculated and compared with the solar indices. It was observed that the years
with excessive and insufficient rainfall coincide with the years when the solar
activity is at its highest or minimum. It is suggested that there is a physical
link and a way to predict extreme rainfall events in Kerala based on the
association between solar activity and those events.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10460v1
Efficient Denoising Method to Improve The Resolution of Satellite Images,2024-11-11T03:33:53Z,Jhanavi Hegde,"Satellites are widely used to estimate and monitor ground cover, providing
critical information to address the challenges posed by climate change.
High-resolution satellite images help to identify smaller features on the
ground and classification of ground cover types. Small satellites have become
very popular recently due to their cost-effectiveness. However, smaller
satellites have weaker spatial resolution, and preprocessing using recent
generative models made it possible to enhance the resolution of these satellite
images. The objective of this paper is to propose computationally efficient
guided or image-conditioned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to perform
super-resolution on low-quality images. Denoising based on stochastic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) typically takes hundreds of iterations and it can
be reduced using deterministic ODEs. I propose Consistency Models (CM) that
utilize deterministic ODEs for efficient denoising and perform super resolution
on satellite images. The DOTA v2.0 image dataset that is used to develop object
detectors needed for urban planning and ground cover estimation, is used in
this project. The Stable Diffusion model is used as the base model, and the DDM
in Stable Diffusion is converted into a Consistency Model (CM) using
Teacher-Student Distillation to apply deterministic denoising. Stable diffusion
with modified CM has successfully improved the resolution of satellite images
by a factor of 16, and the computational time was reduced by a factor of 20
compared to stochastic denoising methods. The FID score of low-resolution
images improved from 10.0 to 1.9 after increasing the image resolution using my
algorithm for consistency models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10476v1

  Virus Infection",2024-11-16T21:09:04Z,"Xu Cao, Wenqian Ye, Kenny Moise, Megan Coffee","In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid accelerating climate
change, emerging infectious diseases, particularly those arising from zoonotic
spillover, remain a global threat. Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a
notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially
as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse
populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO
Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of
international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep
learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust
and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking
due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal
clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we
propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by
analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM
integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT)
classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned
on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released
mpox skin lesion dataset. Our work achieves 90.38% accuracy for mpox detection,

across different polarimetric configurations and geosplit configurations. We
investigated the impact of these variations on classification accuracy,
comparing the performance of various tabular machine-learning models and
optimizing them using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we incorporated a

  Concentrations",2024-11-20T01:58:20Z,"Runlong Yu, Chonghao Qiu, Robert Ladwig, Paul C. Hanson, Yiqun Xie, Yanhua Li, Xiaowei Jia","This paper introduces a \textit{Process-Guided Learning (Pril)} framework
that integrates physical models with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
enhance the prediction of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in lakes, which
is crucial for sustaining water quality and ecosystem health. Unlike
traditional RNNs, which may deliver high accuracy but often lack physical
consistency and broad applicability, the \textit{Pril} method incorporates
differential DO equations for each lake layer, modeling it as a first-order
linear solution using a forward Euler scheme with a daily timestep. However,
this method is sensitive to numerical instabilities. When drastic fluctuations
occur, the numerical integration is neither mass-conservative nor stable.
Especially during stratified conditions, exogenous fluxes into each layer cause
significant within-day changes in DO concentrations. To address this challenge,
we further propose an \textit{Adaptive Process-Guided Learning (April)} model,
which dynamically adjusts timesteps from daily to sub-daily intervals with the
aim of mitigating the discrepancies caused by variations in entrainment fluxes.
\textit{April} uses a generator-discriminator architecture to identify days
with significant DO fluctuations and employs a multi-step Euler scheme with
sub-daily timesteps to effectively manage these variations. We have tested our
methods on a wide range of lakes in the Midwestern USA, and demonstrated robust
capability in predicting DO concentrations even with limited training data.
While primarily focused on aquatic ecosystems, this approach is broadly
applicable to diverse scientific and engineering disciplines that utilize

biomedicine.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12973v1

contributions to aerosol research, the vast AERONET dataset (1993-2023) calls
for a comprehensive reevaluation to refine global aerosol models and improve
satellite retrievals. This is particularly important in light of major
environmental changes such as industrialization, land use shifts, and natural
events like wildfires and dust storms. In this study, a set of fine and coarse
aerosol models called AERONET-Extended (AEROEX) models are developed based on
cluster analysis of 30-years AERONET data, analyzing over 202,000 samples using
Gaussian Mixture Models to classify aerosol types by season and region.
Aerosols are categorized into spherical, spheroidal, and mixed types using
particle linear depolarization ratio and fine mode fraction. Four fine-mode
aerosol models were derived based on differences in scattering and absorption
properties, revealing regional/seasonal variations, particularly in North
America, Europe and Asia. Additionally, two coarse-mode aerosol models were
identified, separated by their absorbing properties in dust-prone and polluted
regions. We performed simulation analysis showing that the new models
significantly improve satellite-based aerosol optical depth retrievals compared

Norway to explore how machine learning can be used to optimize biological
nitrate ($\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) reduction to molecular nitrogen ($\mathrm{N_2}$) in
the biogeochemical process known as \textit{denitrification}. Rather than
focusing solely on predictive accuracy, our approach prioritizes understanding
the foundational requirements for effective data-driven modelling of wastewater

effectively, and what properties are required by the models. We find that
nonlinear models perform best on the training and validation data sets,

better to the unseen test data, which comes later in time. The variable
measuring the water temperature has a particularly detrimental effect on the
models, owing to a significant change in distributions between training and

developed to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of
predictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through
fine-tuning. The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge
polygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are
more challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated
formation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence
and changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change. The
results show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to
support AI-augmented terrain mapping. The spatial and domain generalizability
of this finding is further validated using a more general dataset EuroCrop for
agricultural field mapping. Finally, we discuss future research directions that
strengthen SAM's applicability in challenging geospatial domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08787v1

  region",2024-01-17T07:34:48Z,"Ala A. M. Salameh, Sonia R. Gámiz-Fortis, Yolanda Castro-Díez, Ahmad Abu Hammad, María Jesús Esteban-Parra","The temporal and spatial trends of 16 climate extreme indices based on daily
maximum and minimum temperatures during the period 1987-2016 at 28 stations
distributed across Israel and Palestine in the Levant region were annually and
seasonally analysed. The Man-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator were
employed for the trend analysis. Results showed that the region has
significantly experienced a dominant warming trend for the last three decades,
with more intense changes for minimum temperatures than for maximum. At annual
scale, maximum values of minimum temperatures exhibited significant increasing
trends up to 0.68{\deg}C/decade. Changes detected were more pronounced than
those for the absolute extreme temperature indices, with 93 and 89% of stations
significantly showed increasing trends in TX90p and TN90p, respectively. The
duration and fixed threshold extreme indices confirmed the trend toward a
warming, with the 86% of the stations exhibited significant increasing trends
in the annual SU25 and TR20. Moreover, 57% of stations showed significant
increasing trends in their SU30 index. At seasonal scale, the analysis of
trends for extreme temperature indices showed intense and broad significant
increasing trends in all absolute extreme temperature indices. In summer, more
than 75% of total stations exhibited significant increasing trends for warm
days and warm nights. In winter and spring, 71% of the total stations also
showed significant increasing trends in SU25 index, whereas the percentage of
stations reached 82% in summer and 64% in autumn for significant increasing
trends in TR20 index. Finally, the influence of large-scale circulation
patterns on temperature extremes was examined. The results highlighted the
presence of significant correlations between most of the selected extreme
temperature indices and the North Sea-Caspian pattern at annual and seasonal

cybersecurity practitioners employ various approaches like detection and
mitigate in coping with this issue. Some old mannerisms like signature-based
detection and behavioral analysis are slow to adapt to the speedy evolution of

provides better accuracy and performance than the traditional methods.
Integration of LSTM and GAN model is the technique that is used for the
synthetic generation of data, leading to the expansion of the training
datasets, and as a result, the detection accuracy is improved. The paper uses
the VirusShare dataset which has more than one million unique samples of the
malware as the training and evaluation set for the presented models. Through
thorough data preparation including tokenization, augmentation, as well as
model training, the LSTM and GAN models convey the better performance in the
tasks compared to straight classifiers. The research outcomes come out with 98%

possibilities for the accurate and unbiased estimation of forest AGB at high

Radar (SAR) and passive optical data exhibit saturation. However, GEDI is a
sampling instrument, collecting dispersed footprints, and its data must be
combined with that from other continuous cover satellites to create
high-resolution maps, using local machine learning methods. In this study, we
developed local models to estimate forest AGB from GEDI L2A data, as the models
used to create GEDI L4 AGB data incorporated minimal field data from China. We
then applied LightGBM and random forest regression to generate wall-to-wall AGB

Random Forest across two contrasting regions. However, in both regions, the
computation speed of LightGBM is substantially faster than that of the random

the Earth's system, as it is fundamental to correctly calculate the energy
budget of the planet. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
instruments on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites continuously monitor daily and
yearly changes in reflection at the planetary surface. The MODIS Surface
Reflectance black-sky albedo dataset (MCD43D, version 6.1) gives detailed
albedo maps in seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared range.
These albedo maps allow us to classify different Lambertian surface types and
their seasonal and yearly variability and change, albeit only in seven spectral
bands. However, a complete set of albedo maps covering the entire wavelength
range is required to simulate radiance spectra, and to correctly retrieve
atmospheric and cloud properties from Earth's remote sensing. We use a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression algorithm to generate
hyperspectral albedo maps of Earth. Combining different datasets of
hyperspectral reflectance laboratory measurements for various dry soils,
vegetation surfaces, and mixtures of both, we reconstruct the albedo maps in
the entire wavelength range from 400 to 2500~nm. The PCA method is trained with
a 10-years average of MODIS data for each day of the year. We obtain
hyperspectral albedo maps with a spatial resolution of 0.05{\deg} in latitude

refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they

refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase

new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational
design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl
glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational
modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time
the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the
use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with
quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive
microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the
molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in
calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular
rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen
bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main
reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve
an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change.
These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the
thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly

the other incorporating atmospheric forcing, to study the behavior of the
Yucatan Channel transport (YCT), the Loop Current (LC), the Loop Current Eddies
(LCEs), their relationships, and the atmospheric forcing effect on them in
short (daily) and long (monthly) time scales. A more comprehensive description
of the LC intrusion and LCE separations was obtained by considering the upper
eastern or western YCT (whose magnitudes are determined by the longitudinal
displacements of the Yucatan Current's core), a perspective not evident when
considering the upper total YCT; specifically, the eastern YCT provides the
most meaningful description of the studied processes. Atmospheric forcing
mainly affects the extended stage of the LC by creating a higher dispersion in
the YCT and LC circulation values in comparison when considering only ocean
dynamics. For the long-term analysis, standardized indexes that integrate the
daily values of the eastern YCT and LC circulation in time were used; their
temporal propagation and persistence (the changes of their characteristics from
short to long time scales) were studied. Intrinsic ocean dynamics produces a
persistent YCT and LC intrusion behavior and consistent LCE separation patterns
from daily to 5-month scales. The atmospheric forcing effects are more
emphasized on the LC intrusion and LCE separations than on the YCT: the YCT
persistence is maintained but not that of the LC intrusion. An increased
occurrence of LCE separations with low or moderate LC intrusion is expected due

timely dengue outbreak forecasts have the potential to prevent such outbreaks,
the majority of dengue prediction studies have predominantly relied on data
that impose significant burdens on individual countries for collection. In this
study, our aim is to improve health equity in resource-constrained countries by
exploring the effectiveness of high-resolution satellite imagery as a
nontraditional and readily accessible data source. By leveraging the wealth of
publicly available and easily obtainable satellite imagery, we present a
scalable satellite extraction framework based on Sentinel Hub, a cloud-based

new energy efficiency strategies in Smart Grids (SGs). In 2018, with proper
legislation, the European Union (EU) defined the Renewable Energy Community
(REC) as a local electrical grid whose participants share their self-produced
renewable energy, aiming at reducing bill costs by taking advantage of proper
incentives. That action aspires to accelerate the spread of local renewable
energy exploitation, whose costs could not be within everyone's reach. Since a
REC is technically an SG, the strategies above can be applied, and
specifically, practical Energy Management Systems (EMSs) are required.
Therefore, in this work, an online Hierarchical EMS (HEMS) is synthesized for
REC cost minimization to evaluate its superiority over a local self-consumption
approach. EU technical indications (as inherited from Italy) are diligently
followed, aiming for results that are as realistic as possible. Power flows
between REC nodes, or Microgrids (MGs) are optimized by taking Energy Storage

hybrid Fuzzy Inference System - Genetic Algorithm (FIS-GA) model is implemented
with the GA encoding the FIS parameters. Power generation and consumption,
which are the overall system input, are predicted by a LSTM trained on
historical data. The proposed hierarchical model achieves good precision in
short computation times and outperforms the self-consumption approach, leading
to about 20% savings compared to the latter. In addition, the Explainable AI
(XAI), which characterizes the model through the FIS, makes results more
reliable thanks to an excellent human interpretation level. To finish, the HEMS

Examining the detectability of ringing on highly eccentric exoplanets,2024-03-01T23:23:44Z,"Mathijs Vanrespaille, Robin Baeyens, Aaron David Schneider, Ludmila Carone, Leen Decin","Eccentric exoplanets offer an opportunity to study the response of an
atmosphere to changing thermal forcing and the robustness of the super-rotating
equatorial jet seen on tidally locked hot Jupiters. However, the atmospheric
dynamics on eccentric planets strongly depend on the planetary rotation period,
which is difficult to constrain observationally. The ringing phenomenon,
whereby the observed emission increases and decreases after the periastron
passage as the flash-heated hemisphere rotates into and out of view, can
provide a tight constraint on rotation. We studied five highly eccentric
transiting exoplanets HAT-P-2 b, HD 80606 b, TOI-3362 b, TOI-4127 b and HD
17156 b to find which displays strong ringing signals that are sufficiently
strong for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect. We implemented the
treatment of eccentricity and non-synchronous rotation in the non-grey climate
model expeRT/MITgcm and generated synthetic light curves. We find four
detectable ringing peaks on HD 80606 b and some undetectable ringing on
TOI-4127 b and HD 17156 b. The lack of clouds, photo-chemistry and obliquity in
our models may have led us to overestimate the amplitude of the ringing
however. The strength of the ringing signal is mostly determined by the
eccentricity, planetary rotation period, planet-to-star radius ratio and
apparent magnitude of the system. We searched for more exoplanets that could
show ringing but found no candidates as promising as HD 80606 b. We recommend
prioritising HD 80606 b as a target for ringing with JWST. A baseline of five
days after the periastron passage would capture three ringing peaks, which is
sufficient to tightly constrain the planetary rotation period. An extension to
seven days would add a fourth peak, which would allow us to verify the rotation
period.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01026v2

adsorption energy, height, and CO2 angle, demonstrating the B and N-doped
fullerenes had the stronger interaction with CO2, which by far exceeded C20's,
improving its physisorption to physicochemical adsorption. Although the
adsorption energy of P-doped fullerenes was not as satisfactory, in most cases,
increasing the electric field led to enhancing CO2 adsorption and incorporating

storage of hydrogen (H$_2$) fuel and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), technologies
which are being pursued to mitigate climate change and advance the energy
transition. Once injected underground, CO$_2$ and H$_2$ will exist in
multiphase fluid-water-rock systems: being partially-soluble, injected fluids
can flow through the porous rack in a connected plume, become disconnected and
trapped as ganglia surrounded by groundwater within the storage rock pore
space, and also dissolve and migrate through the aqueous phase. Recent analyses
have focused on the concentration gradients induced by differing capillary
pressure between fluid ganglia which can drive diffusive transport (""Ostwald
ripening""). However, studies have neglected or excessively simplified important
factors; namely: the non-ideality of gases under geologic conditions, the
opposing equilibrium state of dissolved CO$_2$ and H$_2$ driven by the partial
molar density of dissolved solutes, and entropic and thermodiffusive effects
resulting from geothermal gradients. We conduct an analysis from thermodynamic
first principles and use this to provide numerical estimates at conditions
relevant to underground storage reservoirs. We show that entropic contributions
to the free energy are so significant as to cause a reversal in the direction
of diffusive transport in systems with geothermal gradients. For CO$_2$, even
geothermal gradients less than 10 C/km induce downwards diffusion at depths
relevant to storage. Diffusive transport of H$_2$ is less affected, but still
reverses direction under typical gradients. Contrary to previous studies, we
find that in diffusion and convection will likely work in concert - both
driving CO$_2$ downwards, and both driving H$_2$ upwards - for conditions
representative of their respective storage reservoirs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16659v3

and global scales. Systematic review is employed to construct a literature
database of 271 studies relevant to compound flood hazards in a coastal
context. This review explores the types of compound flood events, their
mechanistic processes, and synthesizes the definitions and terms exhibited
throughout the literature. Considered in the review are six flood drivers
(fluvial, pluvial, coastal, groundwater, damming/dam failure, and tsunami) and
five precursor events and environmental conditions (soil moisture, snow,
temp/heat, fire, and drought). Furthermore, this review summarizes the trends
in research methodology, examines the wide range of study applications, and
considers the influences of climate change and urban environments. Finally,
this review highlights the knowledge gaps in compound flood research and
discusses the implications of review findings on future practices. Our five
recommendations for future compound flood research are to: 1) adopt consistent
definitions, terminology, and approaches; 2) expand the geographic coverage of
research; 3) pursue more inter-comparison projects; 4) develop modelling
frameworks that better couple dynamic earth systems; and 5) design urban and
coastal infrastructure with compound flooding in mind. We hope this review will
help to enhance understanding of compound flooding, guide areas for future
research focus, and close knowledge gaps.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01321v1
"Re-pseudonymization Strategies for Smart Meter Data Are Not Robust to
  Deep Learning Profiling Attacks",2024-04-05T08:27:36Z,"Ana-Maria Cretu, Miruna Rusu, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye","Smart meters, devices measuring the electricity and gas consumption of a
household, are currently being deployed at a fast rate throughout the world.
The data they collect are extremely useful, including in the fight against
climate change. However, these data and the information that can be inferred
from them are highly sensitive. Re-pseudonymization, i.e., the frequent
replacement of random identifiers over time, is widely used to share smart
meter data while mitigating the risk of re-identification. We here show how, in
spite of re-pseudonymization, households' consumption records can be pieced
together with high accuracy in large-scale datasets. We propose the first deep
learning-based profiling attack against re-pseudonymized smart meter data. Our
attack combines neural network embeddings, which are used to extract features
from weekly consumption records and are tailored to the smart meter
identification task, with a nearest neighbor classifier. We evaluate six neural
networks architectures as the embedding model. Our results suggest that the
Transformer and CNN-LSTM architectures vastly outperform previous methods as
well as other architectures, successfully identifying the correct household
73.4% of the time among 5139 households based on electricity and gas
consumption records (54.5% for electricity only). We further show that the
features extracted by the embedding model maintain their effectiveness when
transferred to a set of users disjoint from the one used to train the model.
Finally, we extensively evaluate the robustness of our results. Taken together,
our results strongly suggest that even frequent re-pseudonymization strategies
can be reversed, strongly limiting their ability to prevent re-identification
in practice.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03948v1

  Effective Firebreak Placement",2024-04-12T15:10:57Z,"Lucas Murray, Tatiana Castillo, Jaime Carrasco, Andrés Weintraub, Richard Weber, Isaac Martín de Diego, José Ramón González, Jordi García-Gonzalo","Over the past decades, the increase in both frequency and intensity of
large-scale wildfires due to climate change has emerged as a significant
natural threat. The pressing need to design resilient landscapes capable of
withstanding such disasters has become paramount, requiring the development of
advanced decision-support tools. Existing methodologies, including Mixed
Integer Programming, Stochastic Optimization, and Network Theory, have proven
effective but are hindered by computational demands, limiting their
applicability.
  In response to this challenge, we propose using artificial intelligence
techniques, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning, to address the complex
problem of firebreak placement in the landscape. We employ value-function based
approaches like Deep Q-Learning, Double Deep Q-Learning, and Dueling Double
Deep Q-Learning. Utilizing the Cell2Fire fire spread simulator combined with
Convolutional Neural Networks, we have successfully implemented a computational
agent capable of learning firebreak locations within a forest environment,
achieving good results.
  Furthermore, we incorporate a pre-training loop, initially teaching our agent
to mimic a heuristic-based algorithm and observe that it consistently exceeds
the performance of these solutions. Our findings underscore the immense
potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning for operational research challenges,
especially in fire prevention. Our approach demonstrates convergence with
highly favorable results in problem instances as large as 40 x 40 cells,
marking a significant milestone in applying Reinforcement Learning to this
critical issue.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents a pioneering effort in
using Reinforcement Learning to address the aforementioned problem, offering
promising perspectives in fire prevention and landscape management",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08523v1

Artificial Greenhouse Gases as Exoplanet Technosignatures,2024-05-18T02:37:23Z,"Edward W. Schwieterman, Thomas J. Fauchez, Jacob Haqq-Misra, Ravi K. Kopparapu, Daniel Angerhausen, Daria Pidhorodetska, Michaela Leung, Evan L. Sneed, Elsa Ducrot","Atmospheric pollutants such as CFCs and NO$_{2}$ have been proposed as
potential remotely detectable atmospheric technosignature gases. Here we
investigate the potential for artificial greenhouse gases including CF$_{4}$,
C$_{2}$F$_{6}$, C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, SF$_{6}$, and NF$_{3}$ to generate detectable
atmospheric signatures. In contrast to passive incidental byproducts of
industrial processes, artificial greenhouse gases would represent an
intentional effort to change the climate of a planet with long-lived, low
toxicity gases and would possess low false positive potential. An
extraterrestrial civilization may be motivated to undertake such an effort to
arrest a predicted snowball state on their home world or to terraform an
otherwise uninhabitable terrestrial planet within their system. Because
artificial greenhouse gases strongly absorb in the thermal mid-infrared window
of temperate atmospheres, a terraformed planet will logically possess strong
absorption features from these gases at mid-IR wavelengths ($\sim$8-12 $\mu$m),
possibly accompanied by diagnostic features in the near-IR. As a proof of
concept, we calculate the needed observation time to detect 1 [10](100) ppm of
C$_{2}$F$_{6}$/C$_{3}$F$_{8}$/SF$_{6}$ on TRAPPIST-1f with JWST MIRI/LRS and
NIRSpec. We find that a combination of 1[10](100) ppm each of C$_{2}$F$_{6}$,
C$_{3}$F$_{8}$, and SF$_{6}$ can be detected with an S/N $\geq$ 5 in as few as
25[10](5) transits with MIRI/LRS. We further explore mid-infrared
direct-imaging scenarios with the LIFE mission concept and find these gases are
more detectable than standard biosignatures at these concentrations.
Consequently, artificial greenhouse gases can be readily detected (or excluded)
during normal planetary characterization observations with no additional
overhead.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11149v2

grand challenges such as fostering resilience and climate adaptation.
Information exchange across such diverse groups is crucial for collective
intelligence, especially in volatile environments. To facilitate inter-group
information exchange, Informational Boundary Spanners (IBSs) as pivotal
information exchange 'hubs' are promising. However, the mechanisms that drive
the emergence of IBSs remain poorly understood. To address this gap there is
first a need for a method to identify and measure the emergence of IBSs.
Second, an Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) framework is not available to
systematically study mechanisms for the emergence of IBSs in volatile
environments. Third, even though the ability to learn who provides high-quality
information is thought to be essential to explain the emergence of IBSs, a
rigorous test of this mechanism is missing. The learning mechanism is
formalized using an ABM framework, with the model's outputs analyzed using the
proposed IBS emergence measurement method. To illustrate both the method and
the learning mechanism, we present a case study focused on information sharing
in the volatile environment of a disaster. The study shows that learning
constitutes a mechanism for the emergence of effective IBSs in (a)
low-volatility environments characterised by low uncertainty and (b) in
high-volatility environments characterised by rapid change if the number of
inter-group connections is sufficient. With the method and model, this paper
aims to lay the foundations for exploring mechanisms for the emergence of IBSs

collective intelligence by providing the essential elements for measuring and
understanding the emergence of IBSs and exploring the effect of learning on
their emergence in volatile environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11998v1

  insight on the individual scale: a contribution to green computing",2024-06-06T09:09:42Z,"Julia Bicker, René Schmieding, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Martin J. Kühn","Emerging infectious diseases and climate change are two of the major
challenges in 21st century. Although over the past decades, highly-resolved
mathematical models have contributed in understanding dynamics of infectious
diseases and are of great aid when it comes to finding suitable intervention
measures, they may need substantial computational effort and produce
significant CO2 emissions. Two popular modeling approaches for mitigating
infectious disease dynamics are agent-based and population-based models.
Agent-based models (ABMs) offer a microscopic view and are thus able to capture
heterogeneous human contact behavior and mobility patterns. However, insights
on individual-level dynamics come with high computational effort that scales
with the number of agents. On the other hand, population-based models using
e.g. ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are computationally efficient even
for large populations due to their complexity being independent of the
population size. Yet, population-based models are restricted in their
granularity as they assume a (to some extent) homogeneous and well-mixed
population. To manage the trade-off between computational complexity and level
of detail, we propose spatial- and temporal-hybrid models that use ABMs only in
an area or time frame of interest. To account for relevant influences to
disease dynamics, e.g., from outside, due to commuting activities, we use
population-based models, only adding moderate computational costs. Our
hybridization approach demonstrates significant reduction in computational
effort by up to 98% -- without losing the required depth in information in the
focus frame. Concluding, hybrid epidemiological models can provide insights on
the individual scale where necessary, using aggregated models where possible,
thereby making a contribution to green computing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04386v2

"A Sociotechnical Lens for Evaluating Computer Vision Models: A Case
  Study on Detecting and Reasoning about Gender and Emotion",2024-06-12T13:52:30Z,"Sha Luo, Sang Jung Kim, Zening Duan, Kaiping Chen","In the evolving landscape of computer vision (CV) technologies, the automatic
detection and interpretation of gender and emotion in images is a critical area
of study. This paper investigates social biases in CV models, emphasizing the
limitations of traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and
accuracy. These metrics often fall short in capturing the complexities of
gender and emotion, which are fluid and culturally nuanced constructs. Our
study proposes a sociotechnical framework for evaluating CV models,
incorporating both technical performance measures and considerations of social
fairness. Using a dataset of 5,570 images related to vaccination and climate
change, we empirically compared the performance of various CV models, including
traditional models like DeepFace and FER, and generative models like GPT-4
Vision. Our analysis involved manually validating the gender and emotional
expressions in a subset of images to serve as benchmarks. Our findings reveal
that while GPT-4 Vision outperforms other models in technical accuracy for
gender classification, it exhibits discriminatory biases, particularly in
response to transgender and non-binary personas. Furthermore, the model's
emotion detection skew heavily towards positive emotions, with a notable bias
towards associating female images with happiness, especially when prompted by
male personas. These findings underscore the necessity of developing more
comprehensive evaluation criteria that address both validity and discriminatory
biases in CV models. Our proposed framework provides guidelines for researchers
to critically assess CV tools, ensuring their application in communication
research is both ethical and effective. The significant contribution of this
study lies in its emphasis on a sociotechnical approach, advocating for CV
technologies that support social good and mitigate biases rather than
perpetuate them.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08222v2

implemented a semantic segmentation method such as Unet, Linknet, FPN, and
PSPnet for categorizing vegetation, water, and others (i.e., soil and

of an M dwarf star. Upcoming observations are expected to reveal new rocky
exoplanets and their atmospheres around M dwarf stars. To interpret these
future observations we need to model the atmospheres of such exoplanets. We
configured CESM2-WACCM6, a chemistry climate model, for the orbit and stellar
irradiance of TRAPPIST-1e assuming an initial Earth-like atmospheric
composition. Our aim is to characterize the possible ozone (O$_3$) distribution
and explore how this is influenced by the atmospheric circulation shaped by
orography, using the Helmholtz wind decomposition and meridional mass
streamfunction. The model included Earth-like orography and the substellar
point was located over the Pacific Ocean. For such a scenario, our analysis
reveals a North-South asymmetry in the simulated O$_3$ distribution. The O$_3$
concentration is highest at pressures $>$ 10 hPa (below $\sim$30 km) near the
South Pole. This asymmetry arises from the higher landmass fraction in the
Northern Hemisphere, which causes drag in near-surface flows and leads to an
asymmetric meridional overturning circulation. Catalytic species were roughly
symmetrically distributed and were not found to be primary driver for the O$_3$
asymmetry. The total ozone column (TOC) density was higher for TRAPPIST-1e
compared to Earth, with 8000 Dobson Units (DU) near the South Pole and 2000 DU
near the North Pole. The results emphasise the sensitivity of O$_3$ to model

A Comprehensive Study of Disaster Support Mobile Apps,2024-07-11T02:58:12Z,"Muhamad Syukron, Anuradha Madugalla, Mojtaba Shahin, John Grundy","Context: Disasters are a common global occurrence with climate change leading
to increase both their frequency and intensity. To reduce the impact of these
disasters on lives and livelihoods it is important to provide accurate warnings
and information about recovery and mitigation. Today most emergency management
agencies deliver this information via mobile apps.
  Objective: There is a large collection of disaster mobile apps available
across the globe. But a detailed study is not yet conducted on these apps and
their reviews to understand their key features and user feedback. In this paper
we present a comprehensive analysis to address this research gap.
  Method: We conducted a detailed analysis of 45 disaster apps and 28,161
reviews on these apps. We manually analysed the features of these 45 apps and
for review analysis employed topic modelling and sentiment analysis techniques.
  Results: We identified 13 key features in these apps and categorised them in
to the 4 stages of disaster life cycle. Our analysis revealed 22 topics with
highest discussions being on apps alert functionality, app satisfaction and use
of maps. Sentiment analysis of reviews showed that while 22\% of users provided
positive feedback, 9.5\% were negative and 6.8\% were neutral. It also showed
that signup/signin issues, network issues and app configuration issues were the
most frustrating to users. These impacted user safety as these prevented them
from accessing the app when it mattered most.
  Conclusions: We provide a set of practical recommendations for future
disaster app developers. Our findings will help emergency agencies develop
better disaster apps by ensuring key features are supported in their apps, by
understanding commonly discussed user issues. This will help to improve the
disaster app eco-system and lead to more user friendly and supportive disaster

the previous year, and hitting a record high since observations began in 1958,
while global fossil fuel CO2 emissions only increased by 0.6 +/- 0.5%. This
implies an unprecedented weakening of land and ocean sinks, and raises the
question of where and why this reduction happened. Here we show a global net
land CO2 sink of 0.44 +/- 0.21 GtC yr-1, the weakest since 2003. We used
dynamic global vegetation models, satellites fire emissions, an atmospheric
inversion based on OCO-2 measurements, and emulators of ocean biogeochemical
and data driven models to deliver a fast-track carbon budget in 2023. Those
models ensured consistency with previous carbon budgets. Regional flux
anomalies from 2015-2022 are consistent between top-down and bottom-up
approaches, with the largest abnormal carbon loss in the Amazon during the
drought in the second half of 2023 (0.31 +/- 0.19 GtC yr-1), extreme fire
emissions of 0.58 +/- 0.10 GtC yr-1 in Canada and a loss in South-East Asia

declined by half to 1.13 +/- 0.24 GtC yr-1 in 2023. Meanwhile, the tropics
recovered from the 2015-16 El Nino carbon loss, gained carbon during the La
Nina years (2020-2023), then switched to a carbon loss during the 2023 El Nino
(0.56 +/- 0.23 GtC yr-1). The ocean sink was stronger than normal in the
equatorial eastern Pacific due to reduced upwelling from La Nina's retreat in
early 2023 and the development of El Nino later. Land regions exposed to
extreme heat in 2023 contributed a gross carbon loss of 1.73 GtC yr-1,

"Enhancing Worldwide Image Geolocation by Ensembling Satellite-Based
  Ground-Level Attribute Predictors",2024-07-18T19:15:52Z,"Michael J. Bianco, David Eigen, Michael Gormish","We examine the challenge of estimating the location of a single ground-level
image in the absence of GPS or other location metadata. Currently, geolocation
systems are evaluated by measuring the Great Circle Distance between the
predicted location and ground truth. Because this measurement only uses a
single point, it cannot assess the distribution of predictions by geolocation
systems. Evaluation of a distribution of potential locations (areas) is
required when there are follow-on procedures to further narrow down or verify
the location. This is especially important in poorly-sampled regions e.g. rural
and wilderness areas.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, Recall vs Area (RvA), which
measures the accuracy of estimated distributions of locations. RvA treats image
geolocation results similarly to document retrieval, measuring recall as a
function of area: For a ranked list of (possibly discontiguous) predicted
regions, we measure the area required for accumulated regions to contain the
ground truth coordinate. This produces a curve similar to a precision-recall
curve, where ""precision"" is replaced by square kilometers area, enabling
evaluation for different downstream search area budgets.
  Following from this view of the problem, we then examine an ensembling
approach to global-scale image geolocation, which incorporates information from
multiple sources, and can readily incorporate multiple models, attribute
predictors, and data sources. We study its effectiveness by combining the
geolocation models GeoEstimation and the current state-of-the-art, GeoCLIP,
with attribute predictors based on Oak Ridge National Laboratory LandScan and
European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover. We find significant
improvements in image geolocation for areas that are under-represented in the

observable changes in the climate and environment in general. Each year global
carbon dioxide emissions hit a new record, and it is reported that 0.5% of
total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to data centres as of 2021.
The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked social interest in Large Language
Models (LLMs), the new generation of Language Models with a large number of
parameters and trained on massive amounts of data. Currently, numerous
companies are releasing products featuring various LLMs, with many more models
in development and awaiting release. Deep Learning research is a competitive
field, with only models that reach top performance attracting attention and
being utilized. Hence, achieving better accuracy and results is often the first
priority, while the model's efficiency and the environmental impact of the
study are neglected. However, LLMs demand substantial computational resources
and are very costly to train, both financially and environmentally. It becomes
essential to raise awareness and promote conscious decisions about algorithmic
and hardware choices. Providing information on training time, the approximate
carbon dioxide emissions and power consumption would assist future studies in
making necessary adjustments and determining the compatibility of available
computational resources with model requirements. In this study, we infused T5
LLM with external knowledge and fine-tuned the model for Question-Answering

impact for both steps. The findings demonstrate that the smaller models may not
always be sustainable options, and increased training does not always imply
better performance. The most optimal outcome is achieved by carefully

"A Framework for Assessing Cumulative Exposure to Extreme Temperatures
  During Transit Trip",2024-08-07T20:47:39Z,"Huiying Fan, Hongyu Lu, Geyu Lyu, Angshuman Guin, Randall Guensler","The combined influence of urban heat islands, climate change, and extreme
temperature events are increasingly impacting transit travelers, especially
vulnerable populations such as older adults, people with disabilities, and
those with chronic diseases. Previous studies have generally attempted to
address this issue at either the micro- or macro-level, but each approach
presents different limitations in modeling the impacts on transit trips. Other
research proposes a meso-level approach to address some of these gaps, but the
use of additive exposure calculation and spatial shortest path routing poses
constraints meso-modeling accuracy. This study introduces HeatPath Analyzer, a
framework to assess the exposure of transit riders to extreme temperatures,
using TransitSim 4.0 to generate second-by-second spatio-temporal trip
trajectories, the traveler activity profiles, and thermal comfort levels along
the entire journey. The approach uses heat stress combines the standards
proposed by the NWS and CDC to estimate cumulative exposure for transit riders,
with specific parameters tailored to the elderly and people with disabilities.
The framework assesses the influence of extreme heat and winter chill. A case
study in Atlanta, GA, reveals that 10.2% of trips on an average summer weekday
in 2019 were at risk of extreme heat. The results uncover exposure disparities
across different transit trip mode segments, and across mitigation-based and
adaptation-based strategies. While the mitigation-based strategy highlights
high-exposure segments such as long ingress and egress, adaptation should be
prioritized toward the middle or second half of the trip when a traveler is
waiting for transit or transferring between routes. A comparison between the
traditional additive approach and the dynamic approach presented also shows
significant disparities, which, if overlooked, can mislead policy decisions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04081v1
"Experimental Investigation of Tidally-Forced Internal Wave Turbulence at
  High Reynolds Number",2024-08-10T16:42:56Z,"Zachary Taebel, Alberto Scotti, Pierre-Yves Passaggia, Dylan Bruney","Through basin-scale circulations, the ocean regulates global distributions of
heat, nutrients, and greenhouse gases. To properly predict the future of the
ocean under climate change, we need to develop a thorough understanding of the
underlying mechanisms that drive global circulations. An estimated 2 TW of
power is required to support interior mixing. Roughly half of this power is
believed to come from tidal flow over topography, producing internal gravity
waves (IGW's), which can radiate energy throughout the ocean interior. But it
is difficult to track the subsequent journey from tidal injection to
dissipation, as the energy cascade spans an enormous range of spatio-temporal
scales and multiple different nonlinear transfer mechanisms. To investigate the
full energy pathway from topographic forcing to irreversible mixing, we built a
model ocean in a large-scale laboratory wavetank (9 m x 2.9 m x 0.75 m)
allowing Reynolds numbers up to O(10$^5$). We replicate the tidal forcing by
oscillating an idealized ocean ridge. We track energy transfer across the first
cascade, driven by wave turbulence, using Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)
over the full tank. Through the BOS we observe the formation of various sets of
subharmonics, driven by Triadic Resonant Instabilities (TRI). At later times,
the subharmonics born from TRI engage in different interactions, which
ultimately develop a continuum of waves at frequencies up to $N$. We validate
the three-wave resonant conditions through a Fourier decomposition and confirm
a backward cascade in frequency but a forward cascade in vertical wavenumber.
Through our spatial analysis, we identify relevant three-wave interactions and
show the significance of elastic scattering, a nonlocal interaction, in our
fully evolved system. We note however that the majority of our triads are
local, which have been historically overlooked.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05593v1

to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon
emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be
programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands
and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle
on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to
the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We
address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using
multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network
decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of
dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US
metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find
that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide
intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety,
and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel
and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50%
of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of
intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the
composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably
across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful
strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of
eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle
electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly,

dynamics like epidemics, or agents like animal species, disperse over a larger
area. Understanding these processes is becoming increasingly important as we
attempt to better prepare for potential pandemics and as species ranges shift
in response to climate change. Unfortunately, modeling of stochastic diffusion
is mostly done through inaccurate deterministic tools that fail to capture the
random nature of dispersal or else through expensive computational simulations.
In particular, standard tools fail to fully capture the heterogeneity of the
area over which this diffusion occurs. Rural areas with low population density
require different epidemic models than urban areas; likewise, the edges of a
species range require us to explicitly track low integer numbers of individuals
rather than vague averages. In this work, we introduce a series of new tools
called ""mean-FLAME"" models that track stochastic dispersion using approximate
master equations that explicitly follow the probability distribution of an area
of interest over all of its possible states, up to states that are active
enough to be approximated using a mean-field model. In one limit, this approach
is locally exact if we explicitly track enough states, and in the other limit
collapses back to traditional deterministic models if we track no state
explicitly. Applying this approach, we show how deterministic tools fail to
capture the uncertainty around the speed of nonlinear dynamical processes. This
is especially true for marginal areas that are close to unsuitable for
diffusion, like the edge of a species range or epidemics in small populations.
Capturing the uncertainty in such areas is key to producing accurate forecasts

plant-environment interactions and human management, presents significant
scientific and technical challenges for developing sustainable practices.
Addressing these challenges necessitates transdisciplinary research, involving
intense collaboration among fields such as plant science, engineering, computer
science, and social sciences. Here, we present five case studies from two
research centers demonstrating successful transdisciplinary approaches toward
more sustainable water and fertilizer use. These case studies span multiple
scales. Starting from whole-plant signaling, we explore how reporter plants can
transform our understanding of plant communication and enable efficient
application of water and fertilizers. We then show how new fertilizer

accelerate advancements in breeding new cultivars, we discuss robotic
technologies for high-throughput plant screening in different environments at a
population scale. At the ecosystem scale, we investigate phosphorus recovery
from aquatic systems and methods to minimize phosphorus leaching. Finally, as
agricultural outputs affect all people, we show how to integrate stakeholder

A random planting model,2024-09-24T19:53:15Z,"Julian Talbot, Pascal Viot, David Colliaux","The adoption of agroecological practices will be crucial to address the
challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Such practices favor the
cultivation of plants in complex mixtures with layouts differing from the
monoculture approach of conventional agriculture. Inspired by random sequential
adsorption processes, we propose a one-dimensional model in which the plants
are represented as line segments that start as points and grow at a constant
rate until they reach length $\sigma$ after a time interval $\tau$. The
planting positions and times are randomly chosen with the constraint that plant
overlap is forbidden. We apply an exact, event-driven simulation to investigate
the resulting spatiotemporal patterns and yields in both mono- and duocultures.
After a transient period, with oscillations in the density and coverage, the
field reaches a steady state in which the mean age of plants is one half of the
time to maturity. The structure of the active plants is characterized by
correlation functions between the fluctuation of the age of a plant and its
$k$th neighbour. Nearest neighbours are negatively correlated, while next
nearest neighbours tend to have similar ages. The steady state yield increases
with the planting rate and approaches a maximum value of 4/3 plants per unit
length per unit time. For two species with the same size at maturity but
different growth rates, the more slowly growing species is enriched in the
harvest compared to the seed mix composition. If two species have the same time
to maturity but different sizes, the smaller one is enriched in the harvest
and, at a sufficiently high planting rate, the larger species may be completely
absent. For two species with the same ratio of $\sigma/\tau$ the selectivity is
insensitive to the planting rate. The model may be extended to higher
dimensions, more species and other planting strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16432v1

applications ranging from foreign exchange trading to climate modeling. A
recurring feature across these systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade,
where energy is transferred across the system's length scales, following a
simple power law. The statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, in which only
leading order interactions are considered, successfully predicts scaling laws
for stationary states in idealised scenarios. Realistic conditions, such as
finite size and amplitude effects, and strong dissipation, remain beyond our
current understanding. Lacking comprehensive theoretical insight, we
experimentally trace the formation of a spectral cascade under these

resolve individual wave modes and track their real-time evolution from one to

density is fully characterised by a power-law scaling. We further quantify
specific interactions through statistical correlations to reveal a hierarchy in
the wave-mixing order, thus confirming a key assumption of weak-wave
turbulence. We present a comprehensive time-evolution analysis that is crucial

strong contrast in flux increase and decrease timescales before and after
periapse indicates an opacity term that emerges during the planet's heating
phase, potentially due to more H$^{-}$ than expected from chemical equilibrium

were analysed over 122 years (1901-2022) on an annual scale. A negative
correlation was observed in the winter and post-monsoon seasons, while positive
correlations were seen in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, all of which
were statistically significant. Using cross-wavelet transform, the temporal
relationship between sunspot number and rainfall values was investigated,
revealing significant cross-power at an 8-12 year scale across all seasons.
Wavelet coherence between the two data sets demonstrated significant
correlation at the 2-4 and 4-8 year scales throughout the four seasons. The
results show that the seasonal rainfall over Kerala is related to solar
activity. The solar phases of Solar Cycles 14-24 were determined for all
seasons, and the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall were
identified. It was observed that the descending phase had an impact on excess
rainfall events during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, while the ascending
phase notably affected the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The study
specifically examined the different magnetic polarities of sunspots in
alternating solar cycles, focusing on even and odd cycles. It was found that
extreme rainfall events were more frequent during the winter and pre-monsoon
seasons in the even cycles, whereas in the odd cycles, they were more prevalent

Current RSICI technology encompasses change detection and change captioning,

  For better comprehension of breaking changes in the NPM ecosystem and to
enhance breaking change detection tools, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study to investigate breaking changes in the NPM ecosystem. We construct a

behavioral breaking changes. Additionally, we investigate the reasons why
developers make breaking changes in NPM and find three major reasons, i.e., to
reduce code redundancy, to improve identifier name, and to improve API design,

  We provide actionable implications for future research, e.g., automatic
naming and renaming techniques should be applied in JavaScript projects to

This framework aims to fully leverage the intrinsic knowledge of large language

disasters or other reasons. Furthermore, while most supervised change detection
methods require large-scale training datasets, in many applications only one or

"ChangeGuard: Validating Code Changes via Pairwise Learning-Guided
  Execution",2024-10-21T15:13:32Z,"Lars Gröninger, Beatriz Souza, Michael Pradel","Code changes are an integral part of the software development process. Many
code changes are meant to improve the code without changing its functional
behavior, e.g., refactorings and performance improvements. Unfortunately,
validating whether a code change preserves the behavior is non-trivial,
particularly when the code change is performed deep inside a complex project.
This paper presents ChangeGuard, an approach that uses learning-guided
execution to compare the runtime behavior of a modified function. The approach
is enabled by the novel concept of pairwise learning-guided execution and by a
set of techniques that improve the robustness and coverage of the
state-of-the-art learning-guided execution technique. Our evaluation applies
ChangeGuard to a dataset of 224 manually annotated code changes from popular
Python open-source projects and to three datasets of code changes obtained by
applying automated code transformations. Our results show that the approach
identifies semantics-changing code changes with a precision of 77.1% and a
recall of 69.5%, and that it detects unexpected behavioral changes introduced
by automatic code refactoring tools. In contrast, the existing regression tests
of the analyzed projects miss the vast majority of semantics-changing code
changes, with a recall of only 7.6%. We envision our approach being useful for
detecting unintended behavioral changes early in the development process and
for improving the quality of automated code transformations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16092v1
An Empirical Study of Token-based Micro Commits,2024-05-15T07:52:13Z,"Masanari Kondo, Daniel M. German, Yasutaka Kamei, Naoyasu Ubayashi, Osamu Mizuno","In software development, developers frequently apply maintenance activities
to the source code that change a few lines by a single commit. A good
understanding of the characteristics of such small changes can support quality
assurance approaches (e.g., automated program repair), as it is likely that
small changes are addressing deficiencies in other changes; thus, understanding
the reasons for creating small changes can help understand the types of errors
introduced. Eventually, these reasons and the types of errors can be used to
enhance quality assurance approaches for improving code quality. While prior
studies used code churns to characterize and investigate the small changes,
such a definition has a critical limitation. Specifically, it loses the
information of changed tokens in a line. For example, this definition fails to
distinguish the following two one-line changes: (1) changing a string literal
to fix a displayed message and (2) changing a function call and adding a new
parameter. These are definitely maintenance activities, but we deduce that
researchers and practitioners are interested in supporting the latter change.
To address this limitation, in this paper, we define micro commits, a type of
small change based on changed tokens. Our goal is to quantify small changes
using changed tokens. Changed tokens allow us to identify small changes more
precisely. In fact, this token-level definition can distinguish the above
example. We investigate defined micro commits in four OSS projects and
understand their characteristics as the first empirical study on token-based
micro commits. We find that micro commits mainly replace a single name or
literal token, and micro commits are more likely used to fix bugs.
Additionally, we propose the use of token-based information to support software
engineering approaches in which very small changes significantly affect their
effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09165v1

  Multimodal Instruction Tuning",2024-09-13T07:00:44Z,"Pei Deng, Wenqian Zhou, Hanlin Wu","Remote sensing (RS) change analysis is vital for monitoring Earth's dynamic
processes by detecting alterations in images over time. Traditional change
detection excels at identifying pixel-level changes but lacks the ability to
contextualize these alterations. While recent advancements in change captioning
offer natural language descriptions of changes, they do not support
interactive, user-specific queries. To address these limitations, we introduce
ChangeChat, the first bitemporal vision-language model (VLM) designed

generated using a combination of rule-based methods and GPT-assisted
techniques. Experiments show that ChangeChat offers a comprehensive,
interactive solution for RS change analysis, achieving performance comparable

"LRNet: Change detection of high-resolution remote sensing imagery via
  strategy of localization-then-refinement",2024-04-07T09:05:04Z,"Huan Zhong, Chen Wu, Ziqi Xiao","Change detection, as a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing, has
witnessed continuous development and progress. However, the discrimination of
boundary details remains a significant bottleneck due to the complexity of
surrounding elements between change areas and backgrounds. Discriminating the
boundaries of large change areas results in misalignment, while connecting
boundaries occurs for small change targets. To address the above issues, a
novel network based on the localization-then-refinement strategy is proposed in
this paper, namely LRNet. LRNet consists of two stages: localization and
refinement. In the localization stage, a three-branch encoder simultaneously
extracts original image features and their differential features for
interactive localization of the position of each change area. To minimize
information loss during feature extraction, learnable optimal pooling (LOP) is
proposed to replace the widely used max-pooling. Additionally, this process is
trainable and contributes to the overall optimization of the network. To
effectively interact features from different branches and accurately locate
change areas of various sizes, change alignment attention (C2A) and
hierarchical change alignment module (HCA) are proposed. In the refinement
stage, the localization results from the localization stage are corrected by
constraining the change areas and change edges through the edge-area alignment
module (E2A). Subsequently, the decoder, combined with the difference features
strengthened by C2A in the localization phase, refines change areas of
different sizes, ultimately achieving accurate boundary discrimination of
change areas. The proposed LRNet outperforms 13 other state-of-the-art methods
in terms of comprehensive evaluation metrics and provides the most precise
boundary discrimination results on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04884v1
Understanding Code Change with Micro-Changes,2024-09-16T01:47:25Z,"Lei Chen, Michele Lanza, Shinpei Hayashi","A crucial activity in software maintenance and evolution is the comprehension
of the changes performed by developers, when they submit a pull request and/or
perform a commit on the repository. Typically, code changes are represented in
the form of code diffs, textual representations highlighting the differences
between two file versions, depicting the added, removed, and changed lines.
This simplistic representation must be interpreted by developers, and mentally
lifted to a higher abstraction level, that more closely resembles natural
language descriptions, and eases the creation of a mental model of the changes.
However, the textual diff-based representation is cumbersome, and the lifting
requires considerable domain knowledge and programming skills. We present an
approach, based on the concept of micro-change, to overcome these difficulties,
translating code diffs into a series of pre-defined change operations, which
can be described in natural language. We present a catalog of micro-changes,
together with an automated micro-change detector. To evaluate our approach, we
performed an empirical study on a large set of open-source repositories,

Causal Change Point Detection and Localization,2024-03-19T12:23:48Z,"Shimeng Huang, Jonas Peters, Niklas Pfister","Detecting and localizing change points in sequential data is of interest in

this work, we consider settings in which a response variable $Y$ and a set of
covariates $X=(X^1,\ldots,X^{d+1})$ are observed over time and aim to find
changes in the causal mechanism generating $Y$ from $X$. More specifically, we
assume $Y$ depends linearly on a subset of the covariates and aim to determine
at what time points either the dependency on the subset or the subset itself
changes. We call these time points causal change points (CCPs) and show that
they form a subset of the commonly studied regression change points. We propose
general methodology to both detect and localize CCPs. Although motivated by
causality, we define CCPs without referencing an underlying causal model. The
proposed definition of CCPs exploits a notion of invariance, which is a purely
observational quantity but -- under additional assumptions -- has a causal

Survey in Characterization of Semantic Change,2024-02-29T12:13:50Z,"Jader Martins Camboim de Sá, Marcos Da Silveira, Cédric Pruski","Live languages continuously evolve to integrate the cultural change of human
societies. This evolution manifests through neologisms (new words) or
\textbf{semantic changes} of words (new meaning to existing words).
Understanding the meaning of words is vital for interpreting texts coming from
different cultures (regionalism or slang), domains (e.g., technical terms), or
periods. In computer science, these words are relevant to computational
linguistics algorithms such as translation, information retrieval, question
answering, etc. Semantic changes can potentially impact the quality of the
outcomes of these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to understand and
characterize these changes formally. The study of this impact is a recent
problem that has attracted the attention of the computational linguistics
community. Several approaches propose methods to detect semantic changes with
good precision, but more effort is needed to characterize how the meaning of
words changes and to reason about how to reduce the impact of semantic change.
This survey provides an understandable overview of existing approaches to the
\textit{characterization of semantic changes} and also formally defines three
classes of characterizations: if the meaning of a word becomes more general or
narrow (change in dimension) if the word is used in a more pejorative or
positive/ameliorated sense (change in orientation), and if there is a trend to
use the word in a, for instance, metaphoric or metonymic context (change in

concerned with change-points that have already occurred. The arguably more
important question of when future change-points may occur, remains largely
unexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical model that describes
the mechanism of change-point occurrence. Specifically, the model assumes a
latent process in the form of a random walk driven by non-negative innovations,
and an observed process which behaves differently when the latent process
belongs to different regimes. By construction, an occurrence of a change-point
is equivalent to hitting a regime threshold by the latent process. Therefore,
by predicting when the latent process will hit the next regime threshold,
future change-points can be forecasted. The probabilistic properties of the
model such as stationarity and ergodicity are established. A composite
likelihood-based approach is developed for parameter estimation and model
selection. Moreover, we construct the predictor and prediction interval for

from high-resolution images obtained at various time intervals. Specifically,
for Orange County, crosswalk changes between 2019 and 2021 were manually

lengths of line segments intercepted by the inner axis to explicitly encode the
state changes. Users can interactively adjust the inner axis to filter large
changes of their interest and magnify the difference of relatively-similar
state changes, enhancing its visual scalability and comparison accuracy. We

"SeFi-CD: A Semantic First Change Detection Paradigm That Can Detect Any
  Change You Want",2024-07-13T12:49:58Z,"Ling Zhao, Zhenyang Huang, Dongsheng Kuang, Chengli Peng, Jun Gan, Haifeng Li","The existing change detection(CD) methods can be summarized as the
visual-first change detection (ViFi-CD) paradigm, which first extracts change
features from visual differences and then assigns them specific semantic
information. However, CD is essentially dependent on change regions of interest
(CRoIs), meaning that the CD results are directly determined by the semantics
changes of interest, making its primary image factor semantic of interest
rather than visual. The ViFi-CD paradigm can only assign specific semantics of
interest to specific change features extracted from visual differences, leading
to the inevitable omission of potential CRoIs and the inability to adapt to
different CRoI CD tasks. In other words, changes in other CRoIs cannot be
detected by the ViFi-CD method without retraining the model or significantly
modifying the method. This paper introduces a new CD paradigm, the
semantic-first CD (SeFi-CD) paradigm. The core idea of SeFi-CD is to first
perceive the dynamic semantics of interest and then visually search for change
features related to the semantics. Based on the SeFi-CD paradigm, we designed
Anything You Want Change Detection (AUWCD). Experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the AUWCD outperforms the current state-of-the-art CD methods,
achieving an average F1 score 5.01\% higher than that of these advanced
supervised baselines on the SECOND dataset, with a maximum increase of 13.17\%.
The proposed SeFi-CD offers a novel CD perspective and approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09874v1

in objects of interest within bi-temporal remote sensing images using natural
language. Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general
features across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in
providing granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a
novel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and
semantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the
dependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by
harnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more
comprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics
from change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based
encoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation
neck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a
straightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level
semantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language
model (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the
stability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training
strategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the
proposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results
corroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC
can generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance
across both tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14032v1
Time Variation of the Solar Tachocline,2024-10-02T18:00:10Z,"Sarbani Basu, Wesley Antônio Machado Andrade de Aguiar, Sylvain G. Korzennik","We have used solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings obtained
over solar cycles 23, 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 to investigate
whether the tachocline properties (jump i.e., the change in the rotation rate
across the tachocline, width and position) show any time variation. We confirm
that the change in rotation rate across the tachocline changes substantially,
however, the change does not show a simple correlation with solar cycle unlike,
for instance, changes in mode frequencies. The change during the ascending
phase of solar cycle 25 is almost a mirror image of the change during the
descending part of solar cycle 24, tempting us to speculate that the tachocline
has a much longer period than either the sunspot or the magnetic cycle. We also
find that the position of the tachocline, defined as the mid-point of the
change in rotation rate, showed significant changes during solar cycle 24. The
width of the tachocline, on the other hand, has showed significant changes
during solar cycle 23, but not later. The change in the tachocline becomes more
visible if we look at the upper and lower extents of the tachocline, defined as
(position +/- width). We find that for epochs around solar maxima and minima,
the extent decreases before increasing again - a few more years of data should
clarify this trend. Our results reinforce the need to continue helioseismic
monitoring of the Sun to understand solar activity and its evolution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01895v1

Sigmoid Inference (KD-MSI) that leverages image-level labels. In our approach,
the Class Activation Maps (CAM) are utilized not only to derive a change

distillation process. This is done through a joint training strategy of the
teacher and student networks, enabling the student network to highlight
potential change areas more accurately than teacher network based on
image-level labels. Moreover, we designed a Multiscale Sigmoid Inference (MSI)

Confidence Estimation in Unsupervised Deep Change Vector Analysis,2024-05-16T08:36:20Z,Sudipan Saha,"Unsupervised transfer learning-based change detection methods exploit the
feature extraction capability of pre-trained networks to distinguish changed

many applications, it is of utmost importance to provide trustworthy or
confident results, even if over a subset of pixels. The core challenge in this
problem is to identify changed pixels and confident pixels in an unsupervised
manner. To address this, we propose a two-network model - one tasked with mere
change detection and the other with confidence estimation. While the change
detection network can be used in conjunction with popular transfer
learning-based change detection methods such as Deep Change Vector Analysis,
the confidence estimation network operates similarly to a randomized smoothing

this paper, the dynamic behavior of a TCL fleet is modeled and used to

However it is challenging as the naive approach would use the data twice, first

from post-selection inference, which conditions on the information in the data
used to choose which changes to test. As a result this produces valid p-values;
that is, p-values that have a uniform distribution if there is no change.
Currently such methods have been developed for detecting changes in mean only.
This paper presents two approaches for constructing post-selection p-values for

Additionally, they exhibit computational abilities and can be controlled

real-time speed control, which adjusts the vehicle speed by taking advantage of
broadcasted traffic information, such as signal timings. However, the optimal
control is likely to increase the gap in front of the controlled CAV, which
induces lane changing by other drivers. This study proposes a modified traffic
flow model that aims to predict lane-changing occurrences and assess the impact

control strategy is then developed, subject to the predicted trajectory
generated for the preceding vehicle. Lane change prediction estimates future

edge integrity and internal holes phenomenon of change features. In order to
solve these problems, we design the Change Guiding Network (CGNet), to tackle
the insufficient expression problem of change features in the conventional
U-Net structure adopted in previous methods, which causes inaccurate edge
detection and internal holes. Change maps from deep features with rich semantic
information are generated and used as prior information to guide multi-scale
feature fusion, which can improve the expression ability of change features.
Meanwhile, we propose a self-attention module named Change Guide Module (CGM),
which can effectively capture the long-distance dependency among pixels and
effectively overcome the problem of the insufficient receptive field of
traditional convolutional neural networks. On four major CD datasets, we verify
the usefulness and efficiency of the CGNet, and a large number of experiments
and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CGNet. We're going to
open-source our code at https://github.com/ChengxiHAN/CGNet-CD.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09179v1
"Explainable Self-Organizing Artificial Intelligence Captures Landscape
  Changes Correlated with Human Impact Data",2024-02-29T16:22:59Z,"John M. Wandeto, Birgitta Dresp-Langley","Novel methods of analysis are needed to help advance our understanding of the
intricate interplay between landscape changes, population dynamics, and
sustainable development. Self organized machine learning has been highly
successful in the analysis of visual data the human expert eye may not be able
to see. Thus, subtle but significant changes in fine visual detail in images
relating to trending alterations in natural or urban landscapes may remain
undetected. In the course of time, such changes may be the cause or the
consequence of measurable human impact. Capturing such change in imaging data
as early as possible can make critical information readily available to
citizens, professionals and policymakers. This promotes change awareness, and
facilitates early decision making for action. Here, we use unsupervised
Artificial Intelligence (AI) that exploits principles of self-organized
biological visual learning for the analysis of imaging time series. The
quantization error in the output of a Self Organizing Map prototype is
exploited as a computational metric of variability and change. Given the proven
sensitivity of this neural network metric to the intensity and polarity of
image pixel colour, it is shown to capture critical changes in urban
landscapes. This is achieved here on imaging data for two regions of geographic
interest in Las Vegas County, Nevada, USA. The SOM analysis is combined with
the statistical analysis of demographic data revealing human impacts. These
latter are significantly correlated with the structural change trends in the
numerical data for the specific regions of interest. By correlating data
relative to the impact of human activities with numerical data indicating
structural evolution, human footprint related environmental changes can be
predictably scaled.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09547v1
ExelMap: Explainable Element-based HD-Map Change Detection and Update,2024-09-16T11:17:33Z,"Lena Wild, Ludvig Ericson, Rafael Valencia, Patric Jensfelt","Acquisition and maintenance are central problems in deploying high-definition
(HD) maps for autonomous driving, with two lines of research prevalent in
current literature: Online HD map generation and HD map change detection.
However, the generated map's quality is currently insufficient for safe
deployment, and many change detection approaches fail to precisely localize and
extract the changed map elements, hence lacking explainability and hindering a
potential fleet-based cooperative HD map update. In this paper, we propose the
novel task of explainable element-based HD map change detection and update. In
extending recent approaches that use online mapping techniques informed with an
outdated map prior for HD map updating, we present ExelMap, an explainable
element-based map updating strategy that specifically identifies changed map
elements. In this context, we discuss how currently used metrics fail to
capture change detection performance, while allowing for unfair comparison
between prior-less and prior-informed map generation methods. Finally, we
present an experimental study on real-world changes related to pedestrian
crossings of the Argoverse 2 Map Change Dataset. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first comprehensive problem investigation of real-world end-to-end
element-based HD map change detection and update, and ExelMap the first
proposed solution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10178v1

  Remote Sensing Change Detection",2024-10-31T11:20:13Z,"Ke Li, Fuyu Dong, Di Wang, Shaofeng Li, Quan Wang, Xinbo Gao, Tat-Seng Chua","Remote sensing change detection aims to perceive changes occurring on the
Earth's surface from remote sensing data in different periods, and feed these
changes back to humans. However, most existing methods only focus on detecting
change regions, lacking the capability to interact with users to identify
changes that the users expect. In this paper, we introduce a new task named
Change Detection Question Answering and Grounding (CDQAG), which extends the
traditional change detection task by providing interpretable textual answers
and intuitive visual evidence. To this end, we construct the first CDQAG
benchmark dataset, termed QAG-360K, comprising over 360K triplets of questions,
textual answers, and corresponding high-quality visual masks. It encompasses 10
essential land-cover categories and 8 comprehensive question types, which
provides a valuable and diverse dataset for remote sensing applications.

classic change detection-based visual question answering (CDVQA) and the

"Distributed Tracing for Cascading Changes of Objects in the Kubernetes
  Control Plane",2024-11-02T18:40:01Z,"Tomoyuki Ehira, Daisuke Kotani, Yasuo Okabe","Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that employs a declarative
configuration management approach. In Kubernetes, each desired and actual state
is represented by an ``object'', and multiple controllers autonomously monitor
related objects and update their objects towards the desired state in the
control plane. Because of this design, changes to one object propagate to other
objects in a chain. The cluster operators need to know the time required for
these cascading changes to complete, as it directly affects the quality of
service of applications running on the cluster. However, there is no practical
way to observe this kind of cascading change, including breakdown of the time
taken by each change. Distributed tracing techniques are commonly used in the
microservices architecture to monitor application performance, but they are not
directly applicable to the control plane of Kubernetes; the microservices
architecture relies on explicitly calling APIs on other services, but in
Kubernetes the controllers just monitor objects to know when to start
processing, and never call functions on other controllers directly. In this
paper, we propose a system that automatically traces changes to objects in the
control plane. Our method adds one identifier, a Change Propagation ID (CPID),
to the metadata of an object, and the controller that observes an object change
propagates its CPID to the objects that the controller is updated. When
multiple changes need to be merged on an object, a new CPID is generated, and
the relationship between the original CPID and the new CPID is sent to the
external trace server. We confirmed that change propagation can be visualized
and the required time measured. We also showed that this system's overhead is
not significant.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01336v1

  Change Detection",2024-12-22T08:27:15Z,"Yuhang Gan, Wenjie Xuan, Zhiming Luo, Lei Fang, Zengmao Wang, Juhua Liu, Bo Du","When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing
the appearance ({\it e.g., color, texture}) with the help of semantics ({\it
e.g., objects, relations}). However, mainstream change detection models adopt a
supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main
constraint. Thus, these methods primarily emphasize the difference-aware
features between bi-temporal images and neglect the semantic understanding of
the changed landscapes, which undermines the accuracy in the presence of noise
and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating
semantic priors to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Change Detection network, namely SA-CDNet, which transfers the
common knowledge of the visual foundation models ({\it i.e., FastSAM}) to
change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream
feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware
features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we design a single-temporal
semantic pre-training strategy to enhance the semantic understanding of
landscapes, which brings further increments. Specifically, we construct
pseudo-change detection data from public single-temporal remote sensing
segmentation datasets for large-scale pre-training, where an extra branch is
also introduced for the proxy semantic segmentation task. Experimental results
on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over
the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

  Model",2024-06-26T01:03:39Z,"Zhuo Zheng, Stefano Ermon, Dongjun Kim, Liangpei Zhang, Yanfei Zhong","Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the Earth's surface has been
advanced by deep vision models, which often require lots of labeled
multi-temporal images for training. However, collecting, preprocessing, and
annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since
it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data
generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic,
alleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic
change process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a
probabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation
problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and
semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a
GPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time
series of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled
single-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that
can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change
supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing
foundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific
foundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent
zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability.
Experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g.,
Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time
series of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained

representations of some domain, such as human anatomy, and are frequently a
crucial part of modern information systems. Most of these structures change
over time, incorporating new knowledge or information that was previously
missing. Managing these changes is a challenge, both in terms of communicating
changes to users, and providing mechanisms to make it easier for multiple
stakeholders to contribute.
  To fill that need, we have created KGCL, the Knowledge Graph Change Language,
a standard data model for describing changes to KGs and ontologies at a high
level, and an accompanying human-readable controlled natural language. This
language serves two purposes: a curator can use it to request desired changes,
and it can also be used to describe changes that have already happened,
corresponding to the concepts of ""apply patch"" and ""diff"" commonly used for
managing changes in text documents and computer programs. Another key feature
of KGCL is that descriptions are at a high enough level to be useful and
understood by a variety of stakeholders--for example, ontology edits can be
specified by commands like ""add synonym 'arm' to 'forelimb'"" or ""move
'Parkinson disease' under 'neurodegenerative disease'"".
  We have also built a suite of tools for managing ontology changes. These
include an automated agent that integrates with and monitors GitHub ontology
repositories and applies any requested changes, and a new component in the
BioPortal ontology resource that allows users to make change requests directly
from within the BioPortal user interface.

Specifically, the channels or sources generate observations that are
independent over time, but not necessarily independent at any given time
instant. The sources follow an initial joint distribution, and at an unknown
time instant, the joint distribution of an unknown subset of sources changes.
Importantly, there is a hard constraint that only a fixed number of sources are
allowed to be sampled at each time instant. The goal is to sequentially observe
the sources according to the constraint, and stop sampling as quickly as
possible after the change while controlling the false alarm rate below a
user-specified level. The sources can be selected dynamically based on the
already collected data, and thus, a policy for this problem consists of a joint
sampling and change-detection rule. A non-randomized policy is studied, and an
upper bound is established on its worst-case conditional expected detection

step of local refinement, we derive the limiting distributions for the refined
change point estimators in two different regimes where the minimal jump size
vanishes and where it remains constant as the sample size diverges. Such

space. GDCPD conducts a multivariate Change-Point Detection (CPD) by
implementing Gaussian derivative processes for identifying change locations on
critical system features, as these changes eventually will lead to system
failure. To assess the significance of these changes, Weighted Mahalanobis
Distance (WMD) is applied in both offline and online analyses. In the offline
setting, WMD helps establish a threshold that determines significant system
variations, while in the online setting, it facilitates real-time monitoring,
issuing alarms for potential future system breakdowns. Utilizing the insights
gained from the GDCPD and monitoring scheme, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network is then employed to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the
system. The experimental study of a real-world system demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed methodology in accurately forecasting system

retraining for new tasks. To address these limitations with a single approach,
we propose a novel change detection method that is the first to utilize
unaligned images and textual prompts to output a binary segmentation of changes
relevant to user-provided text. Our architecture not only enables flexible
detection across diverse change detection use cases, but also yields
state-of-the art performance on established benchmarks. Additionally, we
release an accompanying dataset comprising of 100,311 pairs of images with text
prompts and the corresponding change detection labels. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively on datasets
with a wide variety of viewpoints in indoor, outdoor, street level, synthetic,

development as developers integrate these LLMs into their applications. In such
applications, prompts serve as the primary means of interacting with LLMs.
Despite the widespread use of LLM-integrated applications, there is limited
understanding of how developers manage and evolve prompts. This study presents
the first empirical analysis of prompt evolution in LLM-integrated software
development. We analyzed 1,262 prompt changes across 243 GitHub repositories to
investigate the patterns and frequencies of prompt changes, their relationship
with code changes, documentation practices, and their impact on system
behavior. Our findings show that developers primarily evolve prompts through
additions and modifications, with most changes occurring during feature
development. We identified key challenges in prompt engineering: only 21.9% of
prompt changes are documented in commit messages, changes can introduce logical
inconsistencies, and misalignment often occurs between prompt changes and LLM
responses. These insights emphasize the need for specialized testing
frameworks, automated validation tools, and improved documentation practices to
enhance the reliability of LLM-integrated applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17298v2
fastcpd: Fast Change Point Detection in R,2024-04-09T01:33:57Z,"Xingchi Li, Xianyang Zhang","Change point analysis is concerned with detecting and locating structure
breaks in the underlying model of a sequence of observations ordered by time,
space or other variables. A widely adopted approach for change point analysis
is to minimize an objective function with a penalty term on the number of
change points. This framework includes several well-established procedures,
such as the penalized log-likelihood using the (modified) Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) or the minimum description length (MDL). The resulting
optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming or
its improved version, such as the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm
(Killick, Fearnhead, and Eckley 2012). However, existing computational methods
often suffer from two primary limitations: (1) methods based on direct
implementation of dynamic programming or PELT are often time-consuming for long
data sequences due to repeated computation of the cost value over different
segments of the data sequence; (2) state-of-the-art R packages do not provide
enough flexibility for users to handle different change point settings and
models. In this work, we present the fastcpd package, aiming to provide an
efficient and versatile framework for change point detection in several
commonly encountered settings. The core of our algorithm is built upon PELT and
the sequential gradient descent method recently proposed by Zhang and Dawn
(2023). We illustrate the usage of the fastcpd package through several
examples, including mean/variance changes in a (multivariate) Gaussian
sequence, parameter changes in regression models, structural breaks in
ARMA/GARCH/VAR models, and changes in user-specified models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05933v1
"MaskCD: A Remote Sensing Change Detection Network Based on Mask
  Classification",2024-04-18T11:05:15Z,"Weikang Yu, Xiaokang Zhang, Samiran Das, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Pedram Ghamisi","Change detection (CD) from remote sensing (RS) images using deep learning has
been widely investigated in the literature. It is typically regarded as a
pixel-wise labeling task that aims to classify each pixel as changed or
unchanged. Although per-pixel classification networks in encoder-decoder
structures have shown dominance, they still suffer from imprecise boundaries
and incomplete object delineation at various scenes. For high-resolution RS
images, partly or totally changed objects are more worthy of attention rather
than a single pixel. Therefore, we revisit the CD task from the mask prediction
and classification perspective and propose MaskCD to detect changed areas by
adaptively generating categorized masks from input image pairs. Specifically,
it utilizes a cross-level change representation perceiver (CLCRP) to learn
multiscale change-aware representations and capture spatiotemporal relations
from encoded features by exploiting deformable multihead self-attention
(DeformMHSA). Subsequently, a masked-attention-based detection transformers
(MA-DETR) decoder is developed to accurately locate and identify changed
objects based on masked attention and self-attention mechanisms. It
reconstructs the desired changed objects by decoding the pixel-wise
representations into learnable mask proposals and making final predictions from
these candidates. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate
the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Codes and
pretrained models are available online (https://github.com/EricYu97/MaskCD).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12081v1

  Vulnerability Protections for Android Open Source Project",2024-05-26T18:17:46Z,Keun Soo Yim,"This paper presents a framework that selectively triggers security reviews
for incoming source code changes. Functioning as a review bot within a code
review service, the framework can automatically request additional security
reviews at pre-submit time before the code changes are submitted to a source

framework employs a classifier trained to identify code changes with a high
likelihood of vulnerabilities. The online classifier leverages various types of
input features to analyze the review patterns, track the software engineering
process, and mine specific text patterns within given code changes. The
classifier and its features are meticulously chosen and optimized using data
from the submitted code changes and reported vulnerabilities in Android Open

Vulnerability Prevention (VP) framework identifies approximately 80% of the
vulnerability-inducing code changes in the dataset with a precision ratio of
around 98% and a false positive rate of around 1.7%. We discuss the
implications of deploying the VP framework in multi-project settings and future

ChangeViT: Unleashing Plain Vision Transformers for Change Detection,2024-06-18T17:59:08Z,"Duowang Zhu, Xiaohu Huang, Haiyan Huang, Zhenfeng Shao, Qimin Cheng","Change detection in remote sensing images is essential for tracking
environmental changes on the Earth's surface. Despite the success of vision
transformers (ViTs) as backbones in numerous computer vision applications, they
remain underutilized in change detection, where convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) continue to dominate due to their powerful feature extraction
capabilities. In this paper, our study uncovers ViTs' unique advantage in
discerning large-scale changes, a capability where CNNs fall short.
Capitalizing on this insight, we introduce ChangeViT, a framework that adopts a
plain ViT backbone to enhance the performance of large-scale changes. This
framework is supplemented by a detail-capture module that generates detailed
spatial features and a feature injector that efficiently integrates
fine-grained spatial information into high-level semantic learning. The feature
integration ensures that ChangeViT excels in both detecting large-scale changes
and capturing fine-grained details, providing comprehensive change detection
across diverse scales. Without bells and whistles, ChangeViT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three popular high-resolution datasets (i.e.,
LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD) and one low-resolution dataset (i.e., OSCD), which
underscores the unleashed potential of plain ViTs for change detection.
Furthermore, thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses validate the
efficacy of the introduced modules, solidifying the effectiveness of our
approach. The source code is available at

  Temporal Feature Refinement and Multi-Task Integration",2024-06-25T10:53:57Z,"Sebastian Hafner, Heng Fang, Hossein Azizpour, Yifang Ban","Urbanization advances at unprecedented rates, resulting in negative effects
on the environment and human well-being. Remote sensing has the potential to
mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with
accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs
using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task
learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change
detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning
methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation
outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change
detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a
satellite image time series (SITS). Specifically, we propose a temporal feature
refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based
multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task
integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal
building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The
proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution
SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2
(F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal

Exploring the Capabilities of LLMs for Code Change Related Tasks,2024-07-03T05:49:18Z,"Lishui Fan, Jiakun Liu, Zhongxin Liu, David Lo, Xin Xia, Shanping Li","Developers deal with code-change-related tasks daily, e.g., reviewing code.
Pre-trained code and code-change-oriented models have been adapted to help
developers with such tasks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown
their effectiveness in code-related tasks. However, existing LLMs for code
focus on general code syntax and semantics rather than the differences between
two code versions. Thus, it is an open question how LLMs perform on
code-change-related tasks.
  To answer this question, we conduct an empirical study using \textgreater 1B
parameters LLMs on three code-change-related tasks, i.e., code review
generation, commit message generation, and just-in-time comment update, with
in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT, including
LoRA and prefix-tuning). We observe that the performance of LLMs is poor
without examples and generally improves with examples, but more examples do not
always lead to better performance. LLMs tuned with LoRA have comparable
performance to the state-of-the-art small pre-trained models. Larger models are
not always better, but \textsc{Llama~2} and \textsc{Code~Llama} families are
always the best. The best LLMs outperform small pre-trained models on the code
changes that only modify comments and perform comparably on other code changes.
We suggest future work should focus more on guiding LLMs to learn the knowledge
specific to the changes related to code rather than comments for
code-change-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02824v1

  Code Clones",2024-09-13T06:14:50Z,"Reishi Yokomori, Katsuro Inoue","Code clones are code snippets that are identical or similar to other snippets
within the same or different files. They are often created through
copy-and-paste practices and modified during development and maintenance
activities. Since a pair of code clones, known as a clone pair, has a possible
logical coupling between them, it is expected that changes to each snippet are
made simultaneously (co-changed) and consistently. There is extensive research
on code clones, including studies related to the co-change of clones; however,
detailed analysis of commit logs for code clone pairs has been limited.
  In this paper, we investigate the commit logs of code snippets from clone
pairs, using the git-log command to extract changes to cloned code snippets. We
analyzed 45 repositories owned by the Apache Software Foundation on GitHub and
addressed three research questions regarding commit frequency, co-change ratio,
and commit patterns. Our findings indicate that (1) on average, clone snippets
are changed infrequently, typically only two or three times throughout their
lifetime, (2) the ratio of co-changes is about half of all clone changes, with
10-20\% of co-changed commits being concerning (potentially inconsistent), and
(3) 35-65\% of all clone pairs being classified as concerning clone pairs
(potentially inconsistent clone pairs). These results suggest the need for a
consistent management system through the commit timeline of clones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08555v1

understanding the data is critical in supporting trust in these decisions.
However, data is dynamic and evolving, just like the real-world entities it
represents. Thus, an important component of understanding data is analyzing and
drawing insights from the changes it undergoes. Existing methods for exploring
data change list differences exhaustively, which are not interpretable by
humans and lack salient insights regarding change trends. For example, an
explanation that semantically summarizes changes to highlight gender
disparities in performance rewards is more human-consumable than a long list of
employee salary changes. We demonstrate ChARLES, a system that derives semantic
summaries of changes between two snapshots of an evolving database, in an
effective, concise, and interpretable way. Our key observation is that, while
datasets often evolve through point and other small-batch updates, rich data
features can reveal latent semantics that can intuitively summarize the
changes. Under the hood, ChARLES compares database versions, infers feasible
transformations by fitting multiple regression lines over different data
partitions to derive change summaries, and ranks them. ChARLES allows users to
customize it to obtain their preferred explanation by navigating the
accuracy-interpretability tradeoff, and offers a proof of concept for reasoning
about data evolution over real-world datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18386v1

complex, non-stationary data across multi-trial experiments. Traditional change
point detection methods focus on identifying abrupt changes within a single
time series (single trial), targeting shifts in statistical properties such as
the mean, variance, and spectrum over time within that sole trial. In contrast,
our approach considers changes occurring across trials, accommodating changes
that may arise within individual trials due to experimental inconsistencies,
such as varying delays or event duration. By leveraging diverse metrics to
analyze time-frequency characteristics specifically topological changes in the
spectrum and spectrograms, our approach offers a comprehensive framework for
detecting such variations. Our approach can handle different scenarios with
various statistical assumptions, including varying levels of stationarity
within and across trials, making our framework highly adaptable. We validate
our approach through simulations using time-varying autoregressive processes
that exhibit different regime changes. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of detecting changes across trials under diverse conditions.
Furthermore, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to
predictive maintenance using the NASA bearing dataset. By analyzing the
time-frequency characteristics of vibration signals recorded by accelerometers,
our approach accurately identifies bearing failures, showcasing its strong
potential for early fault detection in mechanical systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20443v1

predicting the consequences of these changes is crucial for effective project
control and informed decision-making. This study aims to develop predictive
models to estimate the impact of scope changes on project cost and schedule
using machine learning techniques. The research utilizes a comprehensive
dataset containing detailed information on project tasks, including the Work
Breakdown Structure (WBS), task type, productivity rate, estimated cost, actual
cost, duration, task dependencies, scope change magnitude, and scope change
timing. Multiple machine learning models are developed and evaluated to predict
the impact of scope changes on project cost and schedule. These models include
Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting, and XGBoost. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and
the models are trained using the preprocessed data. Model robustness and
generalization are assessed using cross-validation techniques. To evaluate the
performance of models, we use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2. Residual plots
are generated to assess the goodness of fit and identify any patterns or
outliers. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the XGBoost model and
improve its predictive accuracy. The study identifies the most influential
project attributes in determining the magnitude of cost and schedule deviations
caused by scope modifications. It is identified that productivity rate, scope
change magnitude, task dependencies, estimated cost, actual cost, duration, and

from stochastic single-pulse shape variability (jitter). We find that it is
common for long-term profile variability to be associated with changes in
polarization fractions, but not with polarisation position angle (PA) changes.
PA changes are expected if emission height changes or precession is responsible
for the profile variability. PSR J1741$-$3927 is the only pulsar in our sample
that shows correlated PA variability, and this is associated with orthogonal
polarization mode activity. For the six %the rest, without correlated PA
variability, other pulsars limits on possible emission height changes and
impact angle changes are derived. These limits are consistent with the small
changes in the total intensity profile shape. None of the sources show
detectable spin-down variability correlated with the emission changes, which
are thought to be driven by magnetospheric current fluctuations. Therefore the
absence of correlated spin-down rate variability allows upper limits to be
placed on changes in the magnetospheric charge density.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09065v1

"Designing for Sustained Motivation: A Review of Self-Determination
  Theory in Behaviour Change Technologies",2024-01-31T19:00:08Z,"Lize Alberts, Ulrik Lyngs, Kai Lukoff","Recent years have seen a surge in applications and technologies aimed at
motivating users to achieve personal goals and improve their wellbeing.
However, these often fail to promote long-term behaviour change, and sometimes
even backfire. We consider how self-determination theory (SDT), a metatheory of
human motivation and wellbeing, can help explain why such technologies fail,
and how they may better help users internalise the motivation behind their
goals and make enduring changes in their behaviour. In this work, we
systematically reviewed 15 papers in the ACM Digital Library that apply SDT to
the design of behaviour change technologies (BCTs). We identified 50
suggestions for design features in BCTs, grounded in SDT, that researchers have
applied to enhance user motivation. However, we find that SDT is often
leveraged to optimise engagement with the technology itself rather than with
the targeted behaviour change per se. When interpreted through the lens of SDT,
the implication is that BCTs may fail to cultivate sustained changes in
behaviour, as users' motivation depends on their enjoyment of the intervention,
which may wane over time. An underexplored opportunity remains for designers to
leverage SDT to support users to internalise the ultimate goals and value of
certain behaviour changes, enhancing their motivation to sustain these changes
in the long term.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00121v1
"LaserSAM: Zero-Shot Change Detection Using Visual Segmentation of
  Spinning LiDAR",2024-02-15T20:46:52Z,"Alexander Krawciw, Sven Lilge, Timothy D. Barfoot","This paper presents an approach for applying camera perception techniques to
spinning LiDAR data. To improve the robustness of long-term change detection
from a 3D LiDAR, range and intensity information are rendered into virtual
perspectives using a pinhole camera model. Hue-saturation-value image encoding
is used to colourize the images by range and near-IR intensity. The LiDAR's
active scene illumination makes it invariant to ambient brightness, which
enables night-to-day change detection without additional processing. Using the
range-colourized, perspective image allows existing foundation models to detect
semantic regions. Specifically, the Segment Anything Model detects semantically
similar regions in both a previously acquired map and live view from a
path-repeating robot. By comparing the masks in both views, changes in the live
scan are detected. Results indicate that the Segment Anything Model accurately
captures the shape of arbitrary changes introduced into scenes. The proposed
method achieves a segmentation intersection over union of 73.3% when evaluated
in unstructured environments and 80.4% when evaluated within the planning
corridor. Changes can be detected reliably through day-to-night illumination
variations. After pixel-level masks are generated, the one-to-one
correspondence with 3D points means that the 2D masks can be used directly to
recover the 3D location of the changes. The detected 3D changes are avoided in
a closed loop by treating them as obstacles in a local motion planner.
Experiments on an unmanned ground vehicle demonstrate the performance of the
method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10321v2
OSCaR: Object State Captioning and State Change Representation,2024-02-27T01:48:19Z,"Nguyen Nguyen, Jing Bi, Ali Vosoughi, Yapeng Tian, Pooyan Fazli, Chenliang Xu","The capability of intelligent models to extrapolate and comprehend changes in
object states is a crucial yet demanding aspect of AI research, particularly
through the lens of human interaction in real-world settings. This task
involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects,
and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional
methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a
limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of
symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the
language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object
State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark.
OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique
objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for
evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments
demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of
object state changes. The benchmark includes a fine-tuned model that, despite

Relational Network Verification,2024-03-25T23:47:55Z,"Xieyang Xu, Yifei Yuan, Zachary Kincaid, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Ratul Mahajan, David Walker, Ennan Zhai","Relational network verification is a new approach to validating network
changes. In contrast to traditional network verification, which analyzes
specifications for a single network snapshot, relational network verification
analyzes specifications concerning two network snapshots (e.g., pre- and
post-change snapshots) and captures their similarities and differences.
Relational change specifications are compact and precise because they specify
the flows or paths that change between snapshots and then simply mandate that
other behaviors of the network ""stay the same"", without enumerating them. To
achieve similar guarantees, single-snapshot specifications need to enumerate
all flow and path behaviors that are not expected to change, so we can check
that nothing has accidentally changed. Thus, precise single-snapshot
specifications are proportional to network size, which makes them impractical
to generate for many real-world networks.
  To demonstrate the value of relational reasoning, we develop a high-level
relational specification language and a tool called Rela to validate network
changes. Rela first compiles input specifications and network snapshot
representations to finite state transducers. It then checks compliance using
decision procedures for automaton equivalence. Our experiments using data on
complex changes to a global backbone (with over 10^3 routers) find that Rela
specifications need fewer than 10 terms for 93% of them and it validates 80% of
them within 20 minutes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17277v1

possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of
surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories.
Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement,
particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable
lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities
and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we
reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem,
processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language
prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs
specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and
reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during
inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change
intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations
for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments
based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and
interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane

effective representation learning, ComFace aims to acquire two feature

facial changes. The key point of our method is the use of synthetic face images
to overcome the limitations of collecting real intra-personal face images.
Facial representations learned by ComFace are transferred to three extensive
downstream tasks for comparing faces: estimating facial expression changes,
weight changes, and age changes from two face images of the same individual.
Our ComFace, trained using only synthetic data, achieves comparable to or

Context-aware Difference Distilling for Multi-change Captioning,2024-05-31T14:07:39Z,"Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Li Su, Zheng-Jun Zha, Chenggang Yan, Qingming Huang","Multi-change captioning aims to describe complex and coupled changes within

difference distilling (CARD) network to capture all genuine changes for
yielding sentences. Given an image pair, CARD first decouples context features
that aggregate all similar/dissimilar semantics, termed common/difference
context features. Then, the consistency and independence constraints are
designed to guarantee the alignment/discrepancy of common/difference context
features. Further, the common context features guide the model to mine locally
unchanged features, which are subtracted from the pair to distill locally
difference features. Next, the difference context features augment the locally
difference features to ensure that all changes are distilled. In this way, we

Evaluation of Temporal Change in IR Test Collections,2024-07-01T15:25:31Z,"Jüri Keller, Timo Breuer, Philipp Schaer","Information retrieval systems have been evaluated using the Cranfield
paradigm for many years. This paradigm allows a systematic, fair, and
reproducible evaluation of different retrieval methods in fixed experimental
environments. However, real-world retrieval systems must cope with dynamic
environments and temporal changes that affect the document collection, topical
trends, and the individual user's perception of what is considered relevant.
Yet, the temporal dimension in IR evaluations is still understudied.
  To this end, this work investigates how the temporal generalizability of
effectiveness evaluations can be assessed. As a conceptual model, we generalize
Cranfield-type experiments to the temporal context by classifying the change in
the essential components according to the create, update, and delete operations
of persistent storage known from CRUD. From the different types of change
different evaluation scenarios are derived and it is outlined what they imply.
Based on these scenarios, renowned state-of-the-art retrieval systems are
tested and it is investigated how the retrieval effectiveness changes on
different levels of granularity.
  We show that the proposed measures can be well adapted to describe the
changes in the retrieval results. The experiments conducted confirm that the
retrieval effectiveness strongly depends on the evaluation scenario
investigated. We find that not only the average retrieval performance of single
systems but also the relative system performance are strongly affected by the
components that change and to what extent these components changed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01373v1
Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series,2024-07-10T00:54:42Z,"Shanyun Gao, Raghavendra Addanki, Tong Yu, Ryan A. Rossi, Murat Kocaoglu","Change point detection in time series seeks to identify times when the
probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many
areas, such as human-activity sensing and medical science. In the context of
multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint
distribution of high-dimensional data: If any one variable changes, the whole
time series is assumed to have changed. However, in practical applications, we
may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring
abrupt changes in their distributions in the presence of other time series.
Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the
time-series data generation, we address this problem by proposing a two-stage
non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure
through constraint-based discovery methods. The algorithm then uses conditional
relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The
conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution disparity
between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery
method enables a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to
independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the
typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection
methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the
correctness and utility of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07290v1

measuring the spatial extent and duration of the impact of a single
discretionary lane change, as well as a definitive metric to quantify the
overall spatiotemporal impact. To address these gaps, this study introduces a
quantitative indicator called the Corrected Travel Distance Bias (CTDB), which
accounts for variable speeds due to inherent traffic dynamics, providing a more
accurate assessment of lane-changing impacts. A comprehensive methodology is
developed to compare vehicle trajectory data before and after lane-changing

for more predictable AV behavior and enhanced interaction with human drivers.
Human-like driving, particularly during lane-changing maneuvers on highways, is
a critical area of research due to its significant impact on safety and traffic
flow. Traditional rule-based decision-making approaches often fail to
encapsulate the nuanced boundaries of human behavior in diverse driving
scenarios, while crafting reward functions for learning-based methods
introduces its own set of complexities. This study investigates the application
of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to emulate human-like
lane-changing decisions in AVs. An initial RL policy is pre-trained to ensure
safe lane changes. Subsequently, this policy is employed to gather data, which
is then annotated by humans to train a reward model that discerns lane changes
aligning with human preferences. This human-informed reward model supersedes
the original, guiding the refinement of the policy to reflect human-like
preferences. The effectiveness of RLHF in producing human-like lane changes is
demonstrated through the development and evaluation of conservative and
aggressive lane-changing models within obstacle-rich environments and mixed

wage inequality, and functional distribution of income. The analysis is
conducted for European countries using data on disaggregated industrial
employment shares over the period 2010-2018. First, we identify patterns of
industrial specialisation by validating a country-industry industrial
employment matrix using a bipartite weighted configuration model (BiWCM).
Secondly, we introduce a country-level measure of labour-weighted Fitness,
which can be decomposed in such a way as to isolate a component that identifies
the movement of labour towards more complex industries, which we define as
structural change. Thirdly, we link structural change to i) employment growth,
ii) wage inequality, and iii) labour share of the economy. The results indicate
that our structural change measure is associated negatively with employment
growth. However, it is also associated with lower income inequality. As
countries move to more complex industries, they drop the least complex ones, so
the (low-paid) jobs in the least complex sectors disappear. Finally, structural
change predicts a higher labour ratio of the economy; however, this is likely
to be due to the increase in salaries rather than by job creation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07906v1

changes. This limitation hinders their ability to capture deeper semantics. To
address this, we introduce a novel bi-modal change pre-training model called
BiCC-BERT. BiCC-BERT is pre-trained on a code change corpus to learn bi-modal
semantic representations. To incorporate commit messages from the corpus, we
design a novel pre-training objective called Replaced Message Identification

for lane-change control often depend on vehicles with a certain level of
autonomy (e.g., autonomous or connected autonomous vehicles). To address the
challenges posed by low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles and the high
costs of precise data collection, this study proposes a dynamic lane change
regulation design based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance
freeway traffic efficiency. The proposed framework leverages multi-lane
macroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the
density and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes,
resulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms
exchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose a lane
change regulation strategy using MARL, where one agent is placed at each
discretized lane grid. The state of each agent is represented by aggregated
vehicle attributes within its grid, generated from the SUMO microscopic
simulation environment. The agent's actions are lane-change regulations for
vehicles in its grid. Specifically, lane-change regulation signals are computed
at a centralized traffic management center and then broadcast to connected
vehicles in the corresponding lane grids. Compared to vehicle-level maneuver
control, this approach achieves a higher regulation rate by leveraging vehicle
connectivity while introducing no critical safety concerns, and accommodating
varying levels of connectivity and autonomy within the traffic system. The
proposed model is simulated and evaluated in varied traffic scenarios and
demand conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method improves
overall traffic efficiency with minimal additional energy consumption while
maintaining driving safety.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04341v2
Modeling Processes of Neighborhood Change,2024-01-06T21:08:41Z,"J. Carlos Martínez Mori, Zhanzhan Zhao","An urban planner might design the spatial layout of transportation amenities

objective. However, implementing such a design might trigger processes of
neighborhood change that change who benefits from these amenities in the long
term. If so, has the planner really achieved their fairness objective? Can
algorithmic decision-making anticipate second order effects? In this paper, we
take a step in this direction by formulating processes of neighborhood change
as instances of no-regret dynamics; a collective learning process in which a
set of strategic agents rapidly reach a state of approximate equilibrium. We
mathematize concepts of neighborhood change to model the incentive structures
impacting individual dwelling-site decision-making. Our model accounts for
affordability, access to relevant transit amenities, community ties, and site

Double tunable metamaterial perfect absorber,2024-01-07T08:52:22Z,"Mahyar Radak, Saeed Mirzanejhad","This paper focuses on the simulation of a tunable metamaterial absorber
designed for the infrared region. Adsorbents offer three different mechanisms
to adjust their absorption characteristics. The first method involves changes
in temperature. When the temperature changes, the electrical conductivity of
the active material, vanadium dioxide (VO2), also changes. This transition
between insulating and conducting phases at different temperatures provides the
possibility to adjust the absorption spectrum of the metamaterial. By
exploiting the thermochromic properties of VO2, the conductivity of the
material can be dynamically adjusted over a wide range. Through temperature
control, the conductivity of VO2 changes from 200 S/m to 2*105 S/m, resulting
in a continuous adjustment of the absorption peak intensity. The second method
relies on applying an electric field. By applying an electric field in the
transverse direction of the lead zirconate titanate )PZT( material, the size of
the piezoelectric material undergoes changes and bending. Consequently, the
entire structure bends, leading to a change in the shape of the absorber. This
mechanism allows for precise control of the absorber's shape by applying
different voltages, which in turn enables the modification of the absorption
peak.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03421v1

Model-free Change-point Detection Using Modern Classifiers,2024-04-10T13:19:28Z,"Rohit Kanrar, Feiyu Jiang, Zhanrui Cai","In contemporary data analysis, it is increasingly common to work with
non-stationary complex datasets. These datasets typically extend beyond the
classical low-dimensional Euclidean space, making it challenging to detect
shifts in their distribution without relying on strong structural assumptions.
This paper introduces a novel offline change-point detection method that
leverages modern classifiers developed in the machine-learning community. With
suitable data splitting, the test statistic is constructed through sequential
computation of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of a classifier, which is trained
on data segments on both ends of the sequence. It is shown that the resulting
AUC process attains its maxima at the true change-point location, which
facilitates the change-point estimation. The proposed method is characterized
by its complete nonparametric nature, significant versatility, considerable
flexibility, and absence of stringent assumptions pertaining to the underlying
data or any distributional shifts. Theoretically, we derive the limiting
pivotal distribution of the proposed test statistic under null, as well as the
asymptotic behaviors under both local and fixed alternatives. The weak
consistency of the change-point estimator is provided. Extensive simulation

of parameter changes such as mean and variance, and they typically depend on
laborious tuning or smoothing parameters, which can be challenging to choose in

Automatic Recommendations for Evolving Relational Databases Schema,2024-04-12T15:14:38Z,"Anne Etien, Nicolas Anquetil","Relational databases play a central role in many information systems. Their

contexts, impose to evolve databases and their schemas. But in some scenarios,
it is not so easy to deconstruct a wished evolution of the schema into a
precise sequence of operations. Changing a database schema may impose manually
dropping and recreating dependent entities, or manually searching for

order of application of the operators can be difficult and have profound
consequences. This meta-model allows us to compute the impact of planned
changes and recommend additional changes that will ensure that the RDBMS
constraints are always verified. The recommendations can then be compiled into
a valid SQL patch actually updating the database schema in an orderly way. We

of intelligently adapting to changes in the problem parameters. The AMF
combines a dynamic representation of problems, a real-time sensing system, and
adaptive techniques to navigate continuously changing optimization
environments. Through a simulated dynamic optimization problem, the AMF's
capability is demonstrated to detect environmental changes and proactively
adjust its search strategy. This framework utilizes a differential evolution
algorithm that is improved with an adaptation module that adjusts solutions in
response to detected changes. The capability of the AMF to adjust is tested
through a series of iterations, demonstrating its resilience and robustness in
sustaining solution quality despite the problem's development. The
effectiveness of AMF is demonstrated through a series of simulations on a

Data-adaptive structural change-point detection via isolation,2024-04-30T08:09:24Z,"Andreas Anastasiou, Sophia Loizidou","In this paper, a new data-adaptive method, called DAIS (Data Adaptive

each step, and for the data under consideration, we search for the most
prominent change-point in a targeted neighborhood of the data sequence that
contains this change-point with high probability. Using a suitably chosen
contrast function, the change-point will then get detected after being isolated
in an interval. The isolation feature enhances estimation accuracy, while the
data-adaptive nature of DAIS is advantageous regarding, mainly, computational
complexity. The methodology can be applied to both univariate and multivariate

Mobile Sequencers,2024-05-09T12:39:50Z,Cem Bozsahin,"The article is an attempt to contribute to explorations of a common origin
for language and planned-collaborative action. It gives `semantics of change'
the central stage in the synthesis, from its history and recordkeeping to its
development, its syntax, delivery and reception, including substratal aspects.
  It is suggested that to arrive at a common core, linguistic semantics must be
understood as studying through syntax mobile agent's representing, tracking and
coping with change and no change. Semantics of actions can be conceived the
same way, but through plans instead of syntax. The key point is the following:
Sequencing itself, of words and action sequences, brings in more structural
interpretation to the sequence than which is immediately evident from the
sequents themselves. Mobile sequencers can be understood as subjects
structuring reporting, understanding and keeping track of change and no change.
The idea invites rethinking of the notion of category, both in language and in
planning.
  Understanding understanding change by mobile agents is suggested to be about
human extended practice, not extended-human practice. That's why linguistics is
as important as computer science in the synthesis. It must rely on

Decomposition with control (ODMDwC). Leveraging ODMDwC's ability to find and
track linear approximation of a non-linear system while incorporating control
effects, the proposed method dynamically adapts to its changing behavior due to
aging and seasonality. This approach enables the detection of changes in
spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns, providing a robust solution that
preserves correspondence between the score and the extent of change in the
system dynamics. We formulate a truncated version of ODMDwC and utilize
higher-order time-delay embeddings to mitigate noise and extract broad-band
features. Our method addresses the challenges faced in industrial settings
where safety-critical systems generate non-uniform data streams while requiring
timely and accurate change-point detection to protect profit and life. Our
results demonstrate that this method yields intuitive and improved detection
results compared to the Singular-Value-Decomposition-based method. We validate
our approach using synthetic and real-world data, showing its competitiveness
to other approaches on complex systems' benchmark datasets. Provided guidelines
for hyperparameters selection enhance our method's practical applicability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05976v2
Transformer for Multitemporal Hyperspectral Image Unmixing,2024-07-15T04:02:01Z,"Hang Li, Qiankun Dong, Xueshuo Xie, Xia Xu, Tao Li, Zhenwei Shi","Multitemporal hyperspectral image unmixing (MTHU) holds significant
importance in monitoring and analyzing the dynamic changes of surface. However,
compared to single-temporal unmixing, the multitemporal approach demands
comprehensive consideration of information across different phases, rendering
it a greater challenge. To address this challenge, we propose the Multitemporal
Hyperspectral Image Unmixing Transformer (MUFormer), an end-to-end unsupervised
deep learning model. To effectively perform multitemporal hyperspectral image
unmixing, we introduce two key modules: the Global Awareness Module (GAM) and
the Change Enhancement Module (CEM). The Global Awareness Module computes
self-attention across all phases, facilitating global weight allocation. On the
other hand, the Change Enhancement Module dynamically learns local temporal
changes by comparing endmember changes between adjacent phases. The synergy
between these modules allows for capturing semantic information regarding
endmember and abundance changes, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
multitemporal hyperspectral image unmixing. We conducted experiments on one
real dataset and two synthetic datasets, demonstrating that our model
significantly enhances the effect of multitemporal hyperspectral image
unmixing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10427v1
"Instagram versus women of color: Why are women of color protesting
  Instagram's algorithmic changes?",2024-07-25T00:35:39Z,Ankolika De,"Instagram has been appropriated by communities for several contemporary
social struggles, often translating into real world action. Likewise, women of
color (WOC) have used it to protest, share information and support one another
through its various affordances. However, Instagram is known to have frequent
updates, and recently the updates have been more drastic. The newest update
changed the recommendation algorithm such that it showed video-oriented content
(reels) from unknown accounts over static media from a user's own network.
Several marginalized communities, and especially WOC resisted this change and
others that led to it. Due to the backlash, Instagram rolled back its changes.
Drawing from past HCI work on digital platforms for marginalised communities, I
propose a qualitative study informed by the open research strategy to
understand why WOC are resisting these changes, and eventually provide
implications for design that can help implement changes in a more inclusive
manner.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17679v1
"The Good, the Bad, and the Monstrous: Predicting Highly Change-Prone
  Source Code Methods at Their Inception",2024-08-11T06:20:48Z,Shaiful Chowdhury,"The cost of software maintenance often surpasses the initial development
expenses, making it a significant concern for the software industry. A key
strategy for alleviating future maintenance burdens is the early prediction and
identification of change-prone code components, which allows for timely
optimizations. While prior research has largely concentrated on predicting
change-prone files and classes, an approach less favored by practitioners, this
paper shifts focus to predicting highly change-prone methods, aligning with the
preferences of both practitioners and researchers. We analyzed 774,051 source
code methods from 49 prominent open-source Java projects. Our findings reveal
that approximately 80% of changes are concentrated in just 20% of the methods,
demonstrating the Pareto 80/20 principle. Moreover, this subset of methods is
responsible for the majority of the identified bugs in these projects. After
establishing their critical role in mitigating software maintenance costs, our
study shows that machine learning models can effectively identify these highly
change-prone methods from their inception. Additionally, we conducted a
thorough manual analysis to uncover common patterns (or concepts) among the
more difficult-to-predict methods. These insights can help future research
develop new features and enhance prediction accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05704v2
"A Probabilistic Framework for Adapting to Changing and Recurring
  Concepts in Data Streams",2024-08-18T01:53:52Z,"Ben Halstead, Yun Sing Koh, Patricia Riddle, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Albert Bifet","The distribution of streaming data often changes over time as conditions
change, a phenomenon known as concept drift. Only a subset of previous
experience, collected in similar conditions, is relevant to learning an
accurate classifier for current data. Learning from irrelevant experience
describing a different concept can degrade performance. A system learning from
streaming data must identify which recent experience is irrelevant when
conditions change and which past experience is relevant when concepts reoccur,
\textit{e.g.,} when weather events or financial patterns repeat. Existing
streaming approaches either do not consider experience to change in relevance
over time and thus cannot handle concept drift, or only consider the recency of
experience and thus cannot handle recurring concepts, or only sparsely evaluate
relevance and thus fail when concept drift is missed. To enable learning in
changing conditions, we propose SELeCT, a probabilistic method for continuously
evaluating the relevance of past experience. SELeCT maintains a distinct
internal state for each concept, representing relevant experience with a unique
classifier. We propose a Bayesian algorithm for estimating state relevance,
combining the likelihood of drawing recent observations from a given state with
a transition pattern prior based on the system's current state.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09324v1
"Localization in Dynamic Indoor MIMO-OFDM Wireless Systems using Domain
  Adaptation",2024-08-23T12:11:36Z,"Rafail Ismayilov, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Slawomir Stanczak","We propose a method for predicting the location of user equipment (UE) using
wireless fingerprints in dynamic indoor non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments.
In particular, our method copes with the challenges posed by the drift, birth,
and death of scattering clusters resulting from dynamic changes in the wireless
environment. Prominent examples of such dynamic wireless environments include
factory floors or offices, where the geometry of the environment undergoes
changes over time. These changes affect the distribution of wireless
fingerprints, demonstrating some similarity between the distributions before
and after the change. Consequently, the performance of a location estimator
initially designed for a specific environment may degrade significantly when
applied after changes have occurred in that environment. To address this
limitation, we propose a domain adaptation framework that utilizes neural
networks to align the distributions of wireless fingerprints collected both
before and after environmental changes. By aligning these distributions, we
design an estimator capable of predicting UE locations from their wireless
fingerprints in the new environment. Experiments validate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods in localizing UEs in dynamic wireless environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13017v2

natural image domain using visual instruction tuning. However, these LMMs

promising performance for various RS tasks, it struggles to describe the

the development of an LMM that can describe the changes between the bi-temporal
RS images. However, there is insufficiency of datasets that can be utilized to
tune LMMs. In order to achieve this, we introduce a change description

statistic of the maximum magnitude correlation coefficient to detect the
change. This summary statistic captures the level of correlation present in the
data but also has an asymptotic density. The robust test is designed using the
asymptotic density. The proposed approach is robust because it can help detect
a change in correlation level from some known level to unknown, time-varying
levels. The proposed test is also computationally efficient and valid for a
broad class of data distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
is demonstrated on simulated data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03593v1

'redshift drift,' will provide a crucial direct test of cosmological models.
The change in redshift is readily explained using the concept of conformal time

Lightweight remote sensing Change Detection Network (LCD-Net in short) that
reduces model size and computational cost while maintaining high detection

spatial features and the fusion module to integrate spatial features and
extract temporal features, which leads to increasingly complex manual design of
the fusion module. In this paper, we introduce a novel video model-based

algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only
necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic

detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a
theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally,
we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of

unemployment by facilitating efficient labor redeployment. However, previous
studies analyzing networks show that the boundaries to smooth mobility are
constrained by a fragmented structure in the occupation network. In this study,
positing that this structure will significantly change due to automation, we
propose the skill automation view, which asserts that automation substitutes
for skills, not for occupations, and simulate a scenario of skill automation
drawing on percolation theory. We sequentially remove skills from the
occupation-skill bipartite network and investigate the structural changes in
the projected occupation network. The results show that the accumulation of
small changes (the emergence of bridges between occupations due to skill
automation) triggers significant structural changes in the occupation network.
The structural changes accelerate as the components integrate into a new giant

well-studied combinatorial optimization problem, which involves minimizing the
number of coins needed to make a specific change amount using a given set of

greedy algorithm. While the greedy algorithm is not universally optimal for all
sets of coin denominations, it yields optimal solutions under most real-world
coin systems currently in use, making it an efficient heuristic with broad
practical applicability. Researchers have been studying ways to determine
whether a given coin system guarantees optimal solutions under the greedy
approach, but surprisingly little attention has been given to understanding the
general computational behavior of the greedy algorithm applied to the coin
change problem.
  To address this gap, we introduce the Greedy Coin Change problem and
formalize its decision version: given a target amount $W$ and a set of

  To fill this knowledge gap, this work presents the first empirical analysis

analyzed 343 commits collected from 508 open-source ML projects to identify
common CI/CD configuration change categories in ML projects and devised a
taxonomy of 14 co-changes in CI/CD and ML components. Moreover, we developed a
CI/CD configuration change clustering tool that identified frequent CI/CD
configuration change patterns in 15,634 commits. Furthermore, we measured the
expertise of ML developers who modify CI/CD configurations. Based on this
analysis, we found that 61.8% of commits include a change to the build policy

general open-source projects. Additionally, the co-evolution analysis
identified that CI/CD configurations, in many cases, changed unnecessarily due
to bad practices such as the direct inclusion of dependencies and a lack of

(RUL) estimation of complex equipment. This paper proposes a novel temporal
dynamics learning-based model for detecting change points of individual
devices, even under variable operating conditions, and utilises the learnt
change points to improve the RUL estimation accuracy. During offline model
development, the multivariate sensor data are decomposed to learn fused
temporal correlation features that are generalisable and representative of
normal operation dynamics across multiple operating conditions. Monitoring
statistics and control limit thresholds for normal behaviour are dynamically
constructed from these learnt temporal features for the unsupervised detection
of device-level change points. The detected change points then inform the
degradation data labelling for training a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
RUL estimation model. During online monitoring, the temporal correlation
dynamics of a query device is monitored for breach of the control limit derived
in offline training. If a change point is detected, the device's RUL is
estimated with the well-trained offline model for early preventive action.

we designed two experiments to evaluate the impact of elicitation and
contrasting narratives on attitude change, recall, and engagement. We
hypothesized that eliciting prior beliefs leads to more elaborative thinking
that ultimately results in higher attitude change, better recall, and
engagement. Our findings revealed that visual elicitation leads to higher
engagement in terms of feelings of surprise. While there is an overall attitude
change across all experiment conditions, we did not observe a significant
effect of belief elicitation on attitude change. With regard to recall error,
while participants in the draw trend elicitation exhibited significantly lower
recall error than participants in the categorize trend condition, we found no
significant difference in recall error when comparing elicitation conditions to
no elicitation. In a follow-up study, we added contrasting narratives with the
purpose of making the main visualization (communicating data on the focal
issue) appear strikingly different. Compared to the results of study 1, we
found that contrasting narratives improved engagement in terms of surprise and

fractional calculus (spring-pot model) was selected as the viscoelastic model
for the muscle, in which the data for stress relaxation were fitted on a
straight line on a both logarithmic plot. The experimental stress-relaxation
results showed that viscoelasticity tended to change abruptly at a particular
time during static stretching because the stress-relaxation data were
represented by a broken line comprising two segments on the both logarithmic
plot. Considering two states of viscoelasticity, before and after the change,
the stress-relaxation curve was fitted to the spring-pot model with high
accuracy using segment regression (R2 = 0.99). We compared the parameters of
the spring-pot model before and after the change in muscle viscoelasticity. By
examining these continuous time-series data, we also investigated the time
taken for the effects of stretching to become apparent. Furthermore, by
measuring the changes in muscle viscoelasticity during static stretching before

aims to make a goal-oriented sequence of action steps given partial visual
state observations. The motivation of this problem is to learn a structured and
plannable state and action space. Recent works succeeded in sequence modeling
of steps with only sequence-level annotations accessible during training, which
overlooked the roles of states in the procedures. In this work, we point out
that State CHangEs MAtter (SCHEMA) for procedure planning in instructional
videos. We aim to establish a more structured state space by investigating the
causal relations between steps and states in procedures. Specifically, we
explicitly represent each step as state changes and track the state changes in
procedures. For step representation, we leveraged the commonsense knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) to describe the state changes of steps via our
designed chain-of-thought prompting. For state change tracking, we align visual
state observations with language state descriptions via cross-modal contrastive
learning, and explicitly model the intermediate states of the procedure using
LLM-generated state descriptions. Experiments on CrossTask, COIN, and NIV

"ELGC-Net: Efficient Local-Global Context Aggregation for Remote Sensing
  Change Detection",2024-03-26T17:46:25Z,"Mubashir Noman, Mustansar Fiaz, Hisham Cholakkal, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan","Deep learning has shown remarkable success in remote sensing change detection
(CD), aiming to identify semantic change regions between co-registered
satellite image pairs acquired at distinct time stamps. However, existing
convolutional neural network and transformer-based frameworks often struggle to
accurately segment semantic change regions. Moreover, transformers-based
methods with standard self-attention suffer from quadratic computational
complexity with respect to the image resolution, making them less practical for
CD tasks with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose an
efficient change detection framework, ELGC-Net, which leverages rich contextual
information to precisely estimate change regions while reducing the model size.
Our ELGC-Net comprises a Siamese encoder, fusion modules, and a decoder. The
focus of our design is the introduction of an Efficient Local-Global Context
Aggregator module within the encoder, capturing enhanced global context and
local spatial information through a novel pooled-transpose (PT) attention and
depthwise convolution, respectively. The PT attention employs pooling
operations for robust feature extraction and minimizes computational cost with
transposed attention. Extensive experiments on three challenging CD datasets
demonstrate that ELGC-Net outperforms existing methods. Compared to the recent
transformer-based CD approach (ChangeFormer), ELGC-Net achieves a 1.4% gain in
intersection over union metric on the LEVIR-CD dataset, while significantly
reducing trainable parameters. Our proposed ELGC-Net sets a new
state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing change detection benchmarks.
Finally, we also introduce ELGC-Net-LW, a lighter variant with significantly
reduced computational complexity, suitable for resource-constrained settings,
while achieving comparable performance. Project url

"An incremental hybrid adaptive network-based IDS in Software Defined
  Networks to detect stealth attacks",2024-04-01T13:33:40Z,Abdullah H Alqahtani,"Network attacks have became increasingly more sophisticated and stealthy due
to the advances in technologies and the growing sophistication of attackers.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a type of attack that implement a wide
range of strategies to evade detection and be under the defence radar. Software
Defined Network (SDN) is a network paradigm that implements dynamic
configuration by separating the control plane from the network plane. This
approach improves security aspects by facilitating the employment of network
intrusion detection systems. Implementing Machine Learning (ML) techniques in
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is widely used to detect such attacks but
has a challenge when the data distribution changes. Concept drift is a term
that describes the change in the relationship between the input data and the
target value (label or class). The model is expected to degrade as certain
forms of change occur. In this paper, the primary form of change will be in
user behaviour (particularly changes in attacker behaviour). It is essential
for a model to adapt itself to deviations in data distribution. SDN can help in
monitoring changes in data distribution. This paper discusses changes in
stealth attacker behaviour. The work described here investigates various
concept drift detection algorithms. An incremental hybrid adaptive Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is proposed to tackle the issue of concept
drift in SDN. It can detect known and unknown attacks. The model is evaluated

A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche,2024-04-09T08:56:48Z,Shiva P. Pudasaini,"We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for
rock-ice avalanche. The model is built on a multi-phase mass flow model and
extends a two-phase rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid;
includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically
changing general temperature equation for avalanching bulk mass, the first of
its kind. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange
across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss
of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general
formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal
entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing
coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice
melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves,
characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights
essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an
important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher
amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature.
We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production
rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the
phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter
significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively
characterizes rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when heat
entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to
basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum
balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever
complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing
temperature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06130v2

tension, and muscle length of the ankle and the zero moment point to perform
balance control. In addition, information on the changing body state is
embedded in the model using parametric bias, and the model estimates and adapts
to the current body state by learning this information online. This makes it
possible to adapt to changes in upper body posture that are not directly taken
into account in the model, since it is difficult to learn the complete dynamics
of the whole body considering the amount of data and computation. The model can
also adapt to changes in body state, such as the change in footwear and change
in the joint origin due to recalibration. The effectiveness of this method is
verified by a simulation and by using an actual musculoskeletal humanoid,

AI Alignment with Changing and Influenceable Reward Functions,2024-05-28T00:08:46Z,"Micah Carroll, Davis Foote, Anand Siththaranjan, Stuart Russell, Anca Dragan","Existing AI alignment approaches assume that preferences are static, which is
unrealistic: our preferences change, and may even be influenced by our
interactions with AI systems themselves. To clarify the consequences of
incorrectly assuming static preferences, we introduce Dynamic Reward Markov
Decision Processes (DR-MDPs), which explicitly model preference changes and the
AI's influence on them. We show that despite its convenience, the
static-preference assumption may undermine the soundness of existing alignment
techniques, leading them to implicitly reward AI systems for influencing user
preferences in ways users may not truly want. We then explore potential
solutions. First, we offer a unifying perspective on how an agent's
optimization horizon may partially help reduce undesirable AI influence. Then,
we formalize different notions of AI alignment that account for preference
change from the outset. Comparing the strengths and limitations of 8 such
notions of alignment, we find that they all either err towards causing
undesirable AI influence, or are overly risk-averse, suggesting that a
straightforward solution to the problems of changing preferences may not exist.
As there is no avoiding grappling with changing preferences in real-world
settings, this makes it all the more important to handle these issues with
care, balancing risks and capabilities. We hope our work can provide conceptual
clarity and constitute a first step towards AI alignment practices which
explicitly account for (and contend with) the changing and influenceable nature
of human preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17713v1
On an Interaction Model of General Language Change,2024-06-28T09:24:25Z,"Alfred Fuchs, Martin Schwingenheuer, Elisabeth Steinegger, Thomas Voglmaier","In the following article, we construct an interaction model (a variant of the
SIR-model) of general language change. In the context of language change it is
desirable to deduce the long-term behaviour of the corresponding dynamical
system (for example to decide if complete of reversible language change are
going to happen). We analyse this dynamical system by first proving
non-existence of periodic orbits and then invoking the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson
theorem to show convergence to critical points only. Non-existence of periodic
orbits is established by contradiction in showing that the average position of
a potential periodic orbit must coincide with a certain critical point $C$
which cannot be encircled by the flow of the dynamical system so that the
average position would be pulled to that side. Thus the long-term behaviour of
the model for any given initial constellation of speakers depends only on four
interaction parameters and can be easily analysed by looking at the four
critical points. Subsequent numerical analysis of real data on language change
is used to justify the relevance of the constructed model for the practicing
quantitative linguist. We show how data-fitting methods can be used to
determine the four interaction parameters and predict from them the long-term
behaviour of the system, i.e. if complete language change or reversible
language change will take place.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19775v1

clinical and non-clinical settings. This study developed a deep learning model
to classify systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) BP changes using
photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms. Data from the Vital Signs Database
(VitalDB) comprising 1,005 ICU patients with synchronized PPG and BP recordings
was used. BP changes were categorized into three labels: Spike (increase above
a threshold), Stable (change within a plus or minus threshold), and Dip
(decrease below a threshold). Four time-series classification models were
studied: multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, residual
network, and Encoder. A subset of 500 patients was randomly selected for
training and validation, ensuring a uniform distribution across BP change
labels. Two test datasets were compiled: Test-I (n=500) with a uniform
distribution selection process, and Test-II (n=5) without. The study also
explored the impact of including second-deviation PPG (sdPPG) waveforms as
additional input information. The Encoder model with a Softmax weighting
process using both PPG and sdPPG waveforms achieved the highest detection
accuracy--exceeding 71.3% and 85.4% in Test-I and Test-II, respectively, with
thresholds of 30 mmHg for SBP, 15 mmHg for DBP, and 20 mmHg for MBP.
Corresponding F1-scores were over 71.8% and 88.5%. These findings confirm that
PPG waveforms are effective for real-time monitoring of BP changes in ICU
settings and suggest potential for broader applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03274v1

  framework for modeling non-isothermal gas-liquid-solid flows with phase
  change",2024-07-08T03:49:41Z,"Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy, Amneet Pal Singh Bhalla","This work expands on our recently introduced low Mach enthalpy method [1] for
simulating the melting and solidification of a phase change material (PCM)
alongside (or without) an ambient gas phase. The method captures PCM's volume
change (shrinkage or expansion) by accounting for density change-induced flows.
We present several improvements to the original work. First, we introduce
consistent time integration schemes for the mass, momentum, and enthalpy
equations, which enhance the method stability. Demonstrating the effectiveness
of this scheme, we show that a system free of external forces and heat sources
can conserve its initial mass, momentum, enthalpy, and phase composition. This
allows the system to transition from a non-isothermal, non-equilibrium,
phase-changing state to an isothermal, equilibrium state without exhibiting
unrealistic behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low Mach enthalpy method
accurately simulates thermocapillary flows without introducing spurious phase
changes. We propose an analytical model to validate advanced CFD codes for
simulating metal manufacturing processes like welding and 3D printing. These
processes involve a heat source melting metal or alloy in an inert gas
environment. Traditionally, validation relied on manipulating material
properties to match complex experiments. Our model uses the Stefan problem with
a density jump to provide a straightforward method for validating multiphysics
simulations involving heat sources and phase changes in three-phase
flows.Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of the method in modeling
porosity defects (gas bubble trapping) during metal solidification. A field
extension technique is used to accurately apply surface tension forces in a
three-phase flow situation. This is where part of the bubble surface is trapped
within the (moving) solidification front.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05588v2
Actuation without production bias,2024-07-15T19:38:03Z,"James Kirby, Morgan Sonderegger","Phonetic production bias is the external force most commonly invoked in
computational models of sound change, despite the fact that it is not
responsible for all, or even most, sound changes. Furthermore, the existence of
production bias alone cannot account for how changes do or do not propagate
throughout a speech community. While many other factors have been invoked by
(socio)phoneticians, including but not limited to contact (between
subpopulations) and differences in social evaluation (of variants, groups, or
individuals), these are not typically modeled in computational simulations of
sound change. In this paper, we consider whether production biases have a
unique dynamics in terms of how they impact the population-level spread of
change in a setting where agents learn from multiple teachers. We show that,
while the dynamics conditioned by production bias are not unique, it is not the
case that all perturbing forces have the same dynamics: in particular, if
social weight is a function of individual teachers and the correlation between
a teacher's social weight and the extent to which they realize a production
bias is weak, change is unlikely to propagate. Nevertheless, it remains the
case that changes initiated from different sources may display a similar
dynamics. A more nuanced understanding of how population structure interacts
with individual biases can thus provide a (partial) solution to the
`non-phonologization problem'.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11202v1
Identification of changes in gene expression,2024-07-19T18:58:01Z,"Lucia Ameis, Kathrin Möllenhoff","Evaluating the change in gene expression is a common goal in many research
areas, such as in toxicological studies as well as in clinical trials. In
practice, the analysis is often based on multiple t-tests evaluated at the
observed time points. This severely limits the accuracy of determining the time
points at which the gene changes in expression. Even if a parametric approach
is chosen, the analysis is often restricted to identifying the onset of an
effect. In this paper, we propose a parametric method to identify the time
frame where the gene expression significantly changes. This is achieved by
fitting a parametric model to the time-response data and constructing a
confidence band for its first derivative. The confidence band is derived by a
flexible two step bootstrap approach, which can be applied to a wide variety of
possible curves. Our method focuses on the first derivative, since it provides
an easy to compute and reliable measure for the change in response. It is
summarised in terms of a hypothesis test, such that rejecting the null
hypothesis means detecting a significant change in gene expression.
Furthermore, a method for calculating confidence intervals for time points of
interest (e.g. the beginning and end of significant change) is developed. We
demonstrate the validity of our approach through a simulation study and present
a variety of different applications to mouse gene expression data from a study
investigating the effect of a Western diet on the progression of non-alcoholic

machine learning models to achieve desired outputs. While existing research
primarily addresses static scenarios, real-world applications often involve

this issue often support only specific models or change types, require
extensive hyperparameter tuning, or fail to provide probabilistic guarantees on
CFE robustness to model changes. This paper proposes a novel approach for
generating CFEs that provides probabilistic guarantees for any model and change
type, while offering interpretable and easy-to-select hyperparameters. We
establish a theoretical framework for probabilistically defining robustness to
model change and demonstrate how our BetaRCE method directly stems from it.
BetaRCE is a post-hoc method applied alongside a chosen base CFE generation
method to enhance the quality of the explanation beyond robustness. It
facilitates a transition from the base explanation to a more robust one with
user-adjusted probability bounds. Through experimental comparisons with

Cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables: a statistical study,2024-08-14T23:31:26Z,"Leandro Souza, Raymundo Baptista","We report the results of a statistical study of cyclical period changes in
cataclysmic variables (CVs). Assuming the third-body hypothesis as the cause of
period changes, we estimate the third-body mass, $m_3$, and its separation from
the binary, $a_3$, for 21 CVs showing cyclical period changes from well-sampled
observed-minus-calculated diagrams covering more than a decade of observations.
The inferred $a_3$ values are independent of the binary orbital period,
$P_\mathrm{orb}$, whereas the $m_3$ values increase with $P_\mathrm{orb}$ by an
order of magnitude from the shortest period (oldest) to the longest period
(youngest) systems, implying significant mass loss from the third body with
time. A model for the time evolution of the triple system is not able to
simultaneously explain the observed behavior of the $m_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ and
$a_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ distributions because the combined mass loss from the
binary and the third body demands an increase in orbital separation by factors
$\sim 140$ as the binary evolves toward shorter $P_\mathrm{orb}$'s, in clear
disagreement with the observed distribution. We conclude that the third-body
hypothesis is statistically inconsistent and cannot be used to explain cyclical
period changes observed in CVs. On the other hand, the diagram of the amplitude
of the period change versus the CV donor-star mass is consistent both with the
alternative hypothesis that the observed cyclical period changes are a
consequence of magnetic activity in the solar-type donor star, and with the
standard evolutionary scenario for CVs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07850v1

large-scale and precise observation, high-resolution remote sensing images have
been widely used for anomaly monitoring and localization. Powered by the deep
representation, the existing methods have achieved remarkable advances,
primarily in classification and change detection techniques. However, labeled
samples are difficult to acquire due to the low probability of anomaly
occurrence, and the trained models are limited to fixed anomaly categories,
which hinders the application for anomalies with few samples or unknown
anomalies. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose the anomaly change
detection (AnomalyCD) technique, which accepts time-series observations and
learns to identify anomalous changes by learning from the historical normal
change pattern. Compared to the existing techniques, AnomalyCD processes an
unfixed number of time steps and can localize the various anomalies in a
unified manner, without human supervision. To benchmark AnomalyCD, we
constructed a high-resolution dataset with time-series images dedicated to
various Earth anomalies (the AnomalyCDD dataset). AnomalyCDD contains
high-resolution (from 0.15 to 2.39 m/pixel), time-series (from 3 to 7 time
steps), and large-scale images (1927.93 km2 in total) collected globally
Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot baseline model (AnomalyCDM), which
implements the AnomalyCD technique by extracting a general representation from

Detecting Change Points of Covariance Matrices in High Dimensions,2024-09-23T22:44:41Z,"Nina Dörnemann, Holger Dette","Testing for change points in sequences of high-dimensional covariance
matrices is an important and equally challenging problem in statistical
methodology with applications in various fields. Motivated by the observation
that even in cases where the ratio between dimension and sample size is as
small as $0.05$, tests based on a fixed-dimension asymptotics do not keep their
preassigned level, we propose to derive critical values of test statistics
using an asymptotic regime where the dimension diverges at the same rate as the
sample size.
  This paper introduces a novel and well-founded statistical methodology for
detecting change points in a sequence of high-dimensional covariance matrices.
Our approach utilizes a min-type statistic based on a sequential process of
likelihood ratio statistics. This is used to construct a test for the
hypothesis of the existence of a change point with a corresponding estimator
for its location. We provide theoretical guarantees for these inference tools
by thoroughly analyzing the asymptotic properties of the sequential process of
likelihood ratio statistics in the case where the dimension and sample size
converge with the same rate to infinity. In particular, we prove weak
convergence towards a Gaussian process under the null hypothesis of no change.
To identify the challenging dependency structure between consecutive test
statistics, we employ tools from random matrix theory and stochastic processes.
Moreover, we show that the new test attains power under a class of alternatives
reflecting changes in the bulk of the spectrum, and we prove consistency of the
estimator for the change-point location.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15588v1

MHz) were previously used to probe intracellular contents of cells, as cell
membrane becomes transparent at this frequency range. EM waves interact with
membranes of intracellular organelles, proteins, and water in the MHz-GHz

evoked using optogenetics, with synchronous detection of propagation of EM
waves. Broadband measurements were conducted in the MHz-GHz range to track
changes in transmission coefficients. Neuronal activity was found to reversibly
alter EM wave transmission. Pharmacological suppression of neuronal activity
abolished changes in transmission. Time constants of changes in transmission
were in the range of seconds to tens of seconds, suggesting the presence of
relatively slow, activity-dependent intracellular processes. This study

coordinated vulnerability disclosure model and are silently fixed. This delay
can expose OSS users to risks as malicious parties might exploit the software

vulnerability fixes early and automatically. Existing methods classify
vulnerability fixes by learning code change representations from commits,
typically by concatenating code changes, which does not effectively highlight
nuanced differences. Additionally, previous approaches fine-tune code embedding
models and classification models separately, which limits overall
effectiveness. We propose VFDelta, a lightweight yet effective framework that
embeds code before and after changes using independent models with surrounding

mass. We study a sample of 20 nearby optically-identified CLAGNs from the BAT
AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), using quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray
observations taken in the last $\sim 40$ years. We find that for all CLAGNs,
the transition is accompanied by a change in Eddington ratio. The CL
transitions are not associated with changes in the obscuration properties of
the AGN. CLAGNs are found to have a median Eddington ratio lower than the AGNs

transition Eddington ratio (Eddington ratio at which AGN changes its state) is

which is consistent with the hard $\leftrightarrow$ soft state transition in
black hole X-ray binaries. Most CL events are constrained to occur within 3-4

O-MAGIC: Online Change-Point Detection for Dynamic Systems,2024-11-19T06:56:40Z,"Yan Sun, Yeping Wang, Zhaohui Li, Shihao Yang","The capture of changes in dynamic systems, especially ordinary differential

conventional numerical integration and achieves substantial savings in

"LaVIDE: A Language-Vision Discriminator for Detecting Changes in
  Satellite Image with Map References",2024-11-29T15:04:40Z,"Shuguo Jiang, Fang Xu, Sen Jia, Gui-Song Xia","Change detection, which typically relies on the comparison of bi-temporal
images, is significantly hindered when only a single image is available.
Comparing a single image with an existing map, such as OpenStreetMap, which is
continuously updated through crowd-sourcing, offers a viable solution to this
challenge. Unlike images that carry low-level visual details of ground objects,
maps convey high-level categorical information. This discrepancy in abstraction
levels complicates the alignment and comparison of the two data types. In this
paper, we propose a \textbf{La}nguage-\textbf{VI}sion \textbf{D}iscriminator
for d\textbf{E}tecting changes in satellite image with map references, namely
\ours{}, which leverages language to bridge the information gap between maps
and images. Specifically, \ours{} formulates change detection as the problem of
``{\textit Does the pixel belong to [class]?}'', aligning maps and images
within the feature space of the language-vision model to associate high-level
map categories with low-level image details. Moreover, we build a
mixture-of-experts discriminative module, which compares linguistic features
from maps with visual features from images across various semantic
perspectives, achieving comprehensive semantic comparison for change detection.
Extensive evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that \ours{} can
effectively detect changes in satellite image with map references,
outperforming state-of-the-art change detection algorithms, e.g., with gains of
about $13.8$\% on the DynamicEarthNet dataset and $4.3$\% on the SECOND
dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19758v1

complexity and increased communication efficiency. Syntactic dependency
distance, which measures the linear distance between dependent words, is often
considered a key indicator of language processing difficulty and working memory
load. The current paper looks at diachronic trends in syntactic language change
in both English and German, using corpora of parliamentary debates from the
last c. 160 years. We base our observations on five dependency parsers,
including the widely used Stanford CoreNLP as well as 4 newer alternatives. Our
analysis of syntactic language change goes beyond linear dependency distance
and explores 15 metrics relevant to dependency distance minimization (DDM)
and/or based on tree graph properties, such as the tree height and degree
variance. Even though we have evidence that recent parsers trained on modern
treebanks are not heavily affected by data 'noise' such as spelling changes and
OCR errors in our historic data, we find that results of syntactic language
change are sensitive to the parsers involved, which is a caution against using
a single parser for evaluating syntactic language change as done in previous
work. We also show that syntactic language change over the time period
investigated is largely similar between English and German for the different
metrics explored: only 4% of cases we examine yield opposite conclusions
regarding upwards and downtrends of syntactic metrics across German and
English. We also show that changes in syntactic measures seem to be more
frequent at the tails of sentence length distributions. To our best knowledge,
ours is the most comprehensive analysis of syntactic language change using
modern NLP technology in recent corpora of English and German.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11549v2

resilience of current vision-based models against diverse object-to-background

introduced synthetic datasets to induce changes to object characteristics
(viewpoints, scale, color) or utilized image transformation techniques
(adversarial changes, common corruptions) on real images to simulate shifts in

diffusion models to generate changes in the background. However, these methods
either lack in offering control over the changes to be made or distort the
object semantics, making them unsuitable for the task. Our method, on the other
hand, can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the
original semantics and appearance of the object. To achieve this goal, we
harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and
image-to-segment models to automatically generate a broad spectrum of
object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background
changes by either modifying the textual prompts or optimizing the latents and
textual embedding of text-to-image models. We produce various versions of
standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO), incorporating either diverse and

distributed plans where each agent can produce its own plans. According to our

Multiscale Quantile Regression with Local Error Control,2024-03-17T22:12:48Z,"Zhi Liu, Housen Li","For robust and efficient detection of change points, we introduce a novel
methodology MUSCLE (multiscale quantile segmentation controlling local error)
that partitions serial data into multiple segments, each sharing a common
quantile. It leverages multiple tests for quantile changes over different
scales and locations, and variational estimation. Unlike the often adopted
global error control, MUSCLE focuses on local errors defined on individual
segments, significantly improving detection power in finding change points.
Meanwhile, due to the built-in model complexity penalty, it enjoys the finite
sample guarantee that its false discovery rate (or the expected proportion of
falsely detected change points) is upper bounded by its unique tuning
parameter. Further, we obtain the consistency and the localisation error rates
in estimating change points, under mild signal-to-noise-ratio conditions. Both
match (up to log factors) the minimax optimality results in the Gaussian setup.
All theories hold under the only distributional assumption of serial

online inference of SSM, and accordingly, a change point detection scheme based
on a generalized likelihood ratio test is developed. How its detection power
relates to the adaptive sampling strategy is analyzed. Meanwhile, by treating
the detection power as a reward, its connection with the online combinatorial

at the heart of materials-related research. Finding how the changes of one
affect the other is of primary importance in theoretical and computational
materials studies. In this work, based on Hershfield nonequilibrium quantum
statistics and the mean-field approach with steady-state density functional
theory, we derive a first-principles method to calculate nonequilibrium effects
induced forces acting on atoms, enabling structure optimizations and molecular
dynamics simulations for molecular junctions under external biases. By applying
the method to a few molecular devices, we found that in general, the external
bias can induce profound nonequilibrium effects on both electronic/transport
properties and the geometric structure of these devices, and consequent changes
in electronic properties and geometric structure are closely interrelated.
Particularly, when the bias voltage is above 1.0 V, significant structure phase
changes could occur, causing dramatic changes in I-V characteristics and
vibrational spectra. These findings greatly broaden our understanding of
quantum electronic devices and provide a new avenue for discovering novel
transport phenomena at molecular scale.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08729v1
Definition generation for lexical semantic change detection,2024-06-20T10:13:08Z,"Mariia Fedorova, Andrey Kutuzov, Yves Scherrer","We use contextualized word definitions generated by large language models as
semantic representations in the task of diachronic lexical semantic change
detection (LSCD). In short, generated definitions are used as `senses', and the
change score of a target word is retrieved by comparing their distributions in
two time periods under comparison. On the material of five datasets and three
languages, we show that generated definitions are indeed specific and general
enough to convey a signal sufficient to rank sets of words by the degree of
their semantic change over time. Our approach is on par with or outperforms
prior non-supervised sense-based LSCD methods. At the same time, it preserves
interpretability and allows to inspect the reasons behind a specific shift in

mathematical terms, we are dealing with signature-type changing manifolds where
a Riemannian region (i.e., a region with a positive definite metric) is
smoothly joined to a Lorentzian region at the surface of transition where time
begins.
  We present a transformation prescription to transform an arbitrary Lorentzian
manifold into a singular signature-type changing manifold. Then we establish
the Transformation Theorem, asserting that, conversely, under certain

metric $g$ through the aforementioned transformation procedure. By augmenting
the assumption by certain constraints, mutatis mutandis, the global version of

  Regularization for Change Captioning",2024-07-16T13:00:33Z,"Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Li Su, Chenggang Yan, Qingming Huang","Change captioning aims to succinctly describe the semantic change between a
pair of similar images, while being immune to distractors (illumination and
viewpoint changes). Under these distractors, unchanged objects often appear
pseudo changes about location and scale, and certain objects might overlap
others, resulting in perturbational and discrimination-degraded features
between two images. However, most existing methods directly capture the
difference between them, which risk obtaining error-prone difference features.
In this paper, we propose a distractors-immune representation learning network
that correlates the corresponding channels of two image representations and
decorrelates different ones in a self-supervised manner, thus attaining a pair
of stable image representations under distractors. Then, the model can better
interact them to capture the reliable difference features for caption
generation. To yield words based on the most related difference features, we
further design a cross-modal contrastive regularization, which regularizes the
cross-modal alignment by maximizing the contrastive alignment between the

Our results revealed consistent patterns: conductivity changes showed negative

A car-following framework for traffic instability and lane changes,2024-12-30T20:42:10Z,"Nicholas Mankowski, Hassan Mushtaq, Hanliang Guo","This paper develops a computational framework based on a car-following model
to study traffic instability and lane changes. Building upon Newell's classical
first-order car-following model, we show that, both analytically and
numerically, there exists a vehicle-density-dependent critical reaction time
that determines the stability of single-lane traffic. Specifically,
perturbations to the equilibrium system decay with time for low reaction time
and grow for high reaction time. This critical reaction time converges to
Newell's original result in the continuum limit. Additionally, we propose a
psychology-based lane-changing mechanism that builds a quantitative connection
between the driver's psychological factor (frustration level) and the driving
condition. We show that our stochastic lane-changing model can faithfully
reproduce interesting phenomena like load-balancing of different lanes. Our
model supports the result that more frequent lane changes only marginally
benefit the driver's overall velocity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01988v1

Extracting Scalar Measures from Curves,2024-02-02T18:19:55Z,"Lanqiu Yao, Thaddeus Tarpey","The ability to order outcomes is necessary to make comparisons which is
complicated when there is no natural ordering on the space of outcomes, as in
the case of functional outcomes. This paper examines methods for extracting a

practice use a change score or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to make
comparisons. However, these standard approaches only use a fraction of the
available data and are inefficient. We derive measures of performance of an

Exception-aware Lifecycle Model Construction for Framework APIs,2024-01-05T06:35:47Z,"Jiwei Yan, Jinhao Huang, Hengqin Yang, Jun Yan","The implementation of complex software systems usually depends on low-level
frameworks or third-party libraries. During their evolution, the APIs adding
and removing behaviors may cause unexpected compatibility problems. So,
precisely analyzing and constructing the framework/ library's API lifecycle
model is of great importance. Existing works have proposed the API
existence-changing model for defect detection, while not considering the
influence of semantic changes in APIs. In some cases, developers will not
remove or deprecate APIs but modify their semantics by adding, removing, or
modifying their exception-thrown code, which may bring potential defects to
upper-level code. Therefore, besides the API existence model, it is also
necessary for developers to be concerned with the exception-related code
evolution in APIs, which requires the construction of exception-aware API
lifecycle models for framework/library projects. To achieve automatic
exception-aware API lifecycle model construction, this paper adopts a static
analysis technique to extract exception summary information in the framework
API code and adopts a multi-step matching strategy to obtain the changing
process of exceptions. Then, it generates exception-aware API lifecycle models
for the given framework/library project. With this approach, the API lifecycle

significantly progressed in remote sensing images. In recent years, CD tasks
have mostly used architectures such as CNN and Transformer to identify these
changes. However, these architectures have shortcomings in representing
boundary details and are prone to false alarms and missed detections under
complex lighting and weather conditions. For that, we propose a new network,
Siamese Meets Diffusion Network (SMDNet). This network combines the Siam-U2Net
Feature Differential Encoder (SU-FDE) and the denoising diffusion implicit
model to improve the accuracy of image edge change detection and enhance the
model's robustness under environmental changes. First, we propose an innovative
SU-FDE module that utilizes shared weight features to capture differences
between time series images and identify similarities between features to
enhance edge detail detection. Furthermore, we add an attention mechanism to
identify key coarse features to improve the model's sensitivity and accuracy.
Finally, the diffusion model of progressive sampling is used to fuse key coarse
features, and the noise reduction ability of the diffusion model and the
advantages of capturing the probability distribution of image data are used to
enhance the adaptability of the model in different environments. Our method's
combination of feature extraction and diffusion models demonstrates
effectiveness in change detection in remote sensing images. The performance
evaluation of SMDNet on LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets yields validated

theory originally developed for Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 (PZT) on the ferroelectric relaxor
0.67Pb[Mg_(1/3)Nb_(2/3)]O_3-0.33PbTiO_3 (PMN-33PT). In the theory, the change
in sound velocity and thermal conductivity with electric field relates to the
piezoelectric coefficients and the Gruneisen parameter. It predicts that in
PMN-33PT the effect should be an order of magnitude larger, and of opposite
sign as in PZT; this is confirmed here experimentally. The effects are measured
on samples never poled before and on samples that underwent multiple field
sweep cycles and passed through two phase transitions with change in
temperature. The thermal conductivity changes are linked to variations in the
piezoelectric coefficients and can be as large as 8-11% at room temperature and

simulations presents a challenging task, demanding the deployment of accurate
and efficient algorithms. Identifying change points in live data stream
involves continuous scrutiny of incoming observations for deviations in their
statistical characteristics, particularly in high-volume data scenarios.
Maintaining a balance between sudden change detection and minimizing false
alarms is vital. Many existing algorithms for this purpose rely on known
probability distributions, limiting their feasibility. In this study, we
introduce the Kernel-based Cumulative Sum (KCUSUM) algorithm, a non-parametric
extension of the traditional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method, which has gained
prominence for its efficacy in online change point detection under less
restrictive conditions. KCUSUM splits itself by comparing incoming samples
directly with reference samples and computes a statistic grounded in the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) non-parametric framework. This approach extends
KCUSUM's pertinence to scenarios where only reference samples are available,
such as atomic trajectories of proteins in vacuum, facilitating the detection
of deviations from the reference sample without prior knowledge of the data's
underlying distribution. Furthermore, by harnessing MMD's inherent random-walk
structure, we can theoretically analyze KCUSUM's performance across various use
cases, including metrics like expected delay and mean runtime to false alarms.
Finally, we discuss real-world use cases from scientific simulations such as
NWChem CODAR and protein folding data, demonstrating KCUSUM's practical

Positive Lynden-Bell derivative as a ticket to the bar trap?,2024-03-13T08:22:53Z,"Viktor D. Zozulia, Anton A. Smirnov, Natalia Ya. Sotnikova","We have translated the results of $N$-body simulations of one barred model
into the language of action variables and frequencies. Using this language, we
analysed the behaviour of all orbits in the model on a large time scale at the
stage of a mature bar. We show that the orbits join the bar while preserving
their adiabatic invariant, which takes into account the 3D structure of the
orbits. This allows us to apply the concept of the Lynden-Bell derivative for
each of these orbits and trace how the sign of the derivative changes, i.e. how
asynchronous changes in angular momentum $L_z$ and orbital precession rate
$\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$ (normal orbital mode) change to synchronous (abnormal
mode). The transition to the abnormal mode occurs when $\Omega_\mathrm{pr}$
reaches the angular velocity of the pattern $\Omega_\mathrm{p}$, after which
the orbit becomes stuck in the bar trap. All this happens against the
background of secular changes in actions ($L_z$ decreases, $J_\mathrm{R}$ and
$J_z$ increase). At the same time, corotation particles near two stable
Lagrange points are also subject to secular changes in their actions. They
increase $L_z$ and drift to the periphery, shifting corotation outwards. We
also show that a change in the orbital mode from normal to abnormal and the
trapping of orbits in a bar is possible only when the bar speed decreases with
time, regardless of what is causing the bar to slow down. Our findings clarify
and expand the picture of bar formation and evolution in numerical models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08326v1
Belief Change based on Knowledge Measures,2024-03-15T17:40:11Z,"Umberto Straccia, Giovanni Casini","Knowledge Measures (KMs) aim at quantifying the amount of
knowledge/information that a knowledge base carries. On the other hand, Belief
Change (BC) is the process of changing beliefs (in our case, in terms of
contraction, expansion and revision) taking into account a new piece of
knowledge, which possibly may be in contradiction with the current belief. We
propose a new quantitative BC framework that is based on KMs by defining belief
change operators that try to minimise, from an information-theoretic point of
view, the surprise that the changed belief carries. To this end, we introduce
the principle of minimal surprise. In particular, our contributions are (i) a
general information-theoretic approach to KMs for which [1] is a special case;
(ii) KM-based BC operators that satisfy the so-called AGM postulates; and (iii)
a characterisation of any BC operator that satisfies the AGM postulates as a
KM-based BC operator, i.e., any BC operator satisfying the AGM postulates can
be encoded within our quantitative BC framework. We also introduce quantitative
measures that account for the information loss of contraction, information gain

"Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Regression via Approximate
  Message Passing",2024-04-11T15:57:12Z,"Gabriel Arpino, Xiaoqi Liu, Julia Gontarek, Ramji Venkataramanan","We consider the problem of localizing change points in a generalized linear
model (GLM), a model that covers many widely studied problems in statistical
learning including linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression. We
propose a novel and computationally efficient Approximate Message Passing (AMP)
algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations, and
rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit where the
number of parameters $p$ is proportional to the number of samples $n$. This
characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to
precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic Hausdorff error
of our change point estimates, and allows us to tailor the algorithm to take
advantage of any prior structural information on the signals and change points.
Moreover, we show how our AMP iterates can be used to efficiently compute a
Bayesian posterior distribution over the change point locations in the
high-dimensional limit. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and
demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic and
real data in the settings of linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07864v2
"ChangeAnywhere: Sample Generation for Remote Sensing Change Detection
  via Semantic Latent Diffusion Model",2024-04-13T03:46:35Z,"Kai Tang, Jin Chen","Remote sensing change detection (CD) is a pivotal technique that pinpoints
changes on a global scale based on multi-temporal images. With the recent
expansion of deep learning, supervised deep learning-based CD models have shown
satisfactory performance. However, CD sample labeling is very time-consuming as
it is densely labeled and requires expert knowledge. To alleviate this problem,
we introduce ChangeAnywhere, a novel CD sample generation method using the
semantic latent diffusion model and single-temporal images. Specifically,
ChangeAnywhere leverages the relative ease of acquiring large single-temporal
semantic datasets to generate large-scale, diverse, and semantically annotated
bi-temporal CD datasets. ChangeAnywhere captures the two essentials of CD
samples, i.e., change implies semantically different, and non-change implies
reasonable change under the same semantic constraints. We generated
ChangeAnywhere-100K, the largest synthesis CD dataset with 100,000 pairs of CD
samples based on the proposed method. The ChangeAnywhere-100K significantly
improved both zero-shot and few-shot performance on two CD benchmark datasets
for various deep learning-based CD models, as demonstrated by transfer
experiments. This paper delineates the enormous potential of ChangeAnywhere for
CD sample generation and demonstrates the subsequent enhancement of model
performance. Therefore, ChangeAnywhere offers a potent tool for remote sensing
CD. All codes and pre-trained models will be available at

essential for developing Autonomous Vehicle technology. While some previous
works have studied the yielding reaction of lag vehicles in response to a
merging car at highway on-ramps, the possible lane-change reaction of the lag
car has not been widely studied. In this work we aim to improve the simulation
of the highway merge scenario by including the lane-change reaction in addition
to yielding behavior of main-lane lag vehicles, and we evaluate two different
models for their ability to capture this reactive lane-change behavior. To tune
the payoff functions of these models, a novel naturalistic dataset was
collected on U.S. highways that provided several hours of merge-specific data
to learn the lane change behavior of U.S. drivers. To make sure that we are
collecting a representative set of different U.S. highway geometries in our
data, we surveyed 50,000 U.S. highway on-ramps and then selected eight
representative sites. The data were collected using roadside-mounted lidar
sensors to capture various merge driver interactions. The models were
demonstrated to be configurable for both keep-straight and lane-change

"A biologically inspired computational trust model for open multi-agent
  systems which is resilient to trustor population changes",2024-04-13T10:56:32Z,"Zoi Lygizou, Dimitris Kalles","Current trust and reputation models continue to have significant limitations,
such as the inability to deal with agents constantly entering or exiting open
multi-agent systems (open MAS), as well as continuously changing behaviors. Our
study is based on CA, a previously proposed decentralized computational trust
model from the trustee's point of view, inspired by synaptic plasticity and the
formation of assemblies in the human brain. It is designed to meet the
requirements of highly dynamic and open MAS, and its main difference with most
conventional trust and reputation models is that the trustor does not select a
trustee to delegate a task; instead, the trustee determines whether it is
qualified to successfully execute it. We ran a series of simulations to compare
CA model to FIRE, a well-established, decentralized trust and reputation model
for open MAS under conditions of continuous trustee and trustor population
replacement, as well as continuous change of trustees' abilities to perform
tasks. The main finding is that FIRE is superior to changes in the trustee
population, whereas CA is resilient to the trustor population changes. When the
trustees switch performance profiles FIRE clearly outperforms despite the fact
that both models' performances are significantly impacted by this environmental
change. Findings lead us to conclude that learning to use the appropriate trust
model, according to the dynamic conditions in effect could maximize the
trustor's benefits.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10014v1

  Sensing Change Detection",2024-04-17T12:32:10Z,"Qiangang Du, Jinlong Peng, Changan Wang, Xu Chen, Qingdong He, Wenbing Zhu, Mingmin Chi, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang","Change detection aims to identify remote sense object changes by analyzing
data between bitemporal image pairs. Due to the large temporal and spatial span
of data collection in change detection image pairs, there are often a
significant amount of task-specific and task-agnostic noise. Previous effort
has focused excessively on denoising, with this goes a great deal of loss of
fine-grained information. In this paper, we revisit the importance of
fine-grained features in change detection and propose a series of operations
for fine-grained information compensation and noise decoupling (FINO). First,
the context is utilized to compensate for the fine-grained information in the
feature space. Next, a shape-aware and a brightness-aware module are designed
to improve the capacity for representation learning. The shape-aware module
guides the backbone for more precise shape estimation, guiding the backbone
network in extracting object shape features. The brightness-aware module learns
a overall brightness estimation to improve the model's robustness to
task-agnostic noise. Finally, a task-specific noise decoupling structure is
designed as a way to improve the model's ability to separate noise interference
from feature similarity. With these training schemes, our proposed method
achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in multiple change detection
benchmarks. The code will be made available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11318v3

  software test automation",2024-05-01T21:22:33Z,"Milad Moradi, Ke Yan, David Colwell, Rhona Asgari","Automated software testing is integral to the software development process,
streamlining workflows and ensuring product reliability. Visual testing within
this context, especially concerning user interface (UI) and user experience
(UX) validation, stands as one of crucial determinants of overall software
quality. Nevertheless, conventional methods like pixel-wise comparison and
region-based visual change detection fall short in capturing contextual
similarities, nuanced alterations, and understanding the spatial relationships
between UI elements. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method for
visual change detection in software test automation. Leveraging a machine
learning model, our method accurately identifies UI controls from software
screenshots and constructs a graph representing contextual and spatial
relationships between the controls. This information is then used to find
correspondence between UI controls within screenshots of different versions of
a software. The resulting graph encapsulates the intricate layout of the UI and
underlying contextual relations, providing a holistic and context-aware model.
This model is finally used to detect and highlight visual regressions in the
UI. Comprehensive experiments on different datasets showed that our change
detector can accurately detect visual software changes in various simple and
complex test scenarios. Moreover, it outperformed pixel-wise comparison and
region-based baselines by a large margin in more complex testing scenarios.
This work not only contributes to the advancement of visual change detection

Towards Robust Physical-world Backdoor Attacks on Lane Detection,2024-05-09T05:23:34Z,"Xinwei Zhang, Aishan Liu, Tianyuan Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Xianglong Liu","Deep learning-based lane detection (LD) plays a critical role in autonomous
driving systems, such as adaptive cruise control. However, it is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attack methods on LD exhibit limited
effectiveness in dynamic real-world scenarios, primarily because they fail to
consider dynamic scene factors, including changes in driving perspectives
(e.g., viewpoint transformations) and environmental conditions (e.g., weather
or lighting changes). To tackle this issue, this paper introduces BadLANE, a
dynamic scene adaptation backdoor attack for LD designed to withstand changes
in real-world dynamic scene factors. To address the challenges posed by
changing driving perspectives, we propose an amorphous trigger pattern composed
of shapeless pixels. This trigger design allows the backdoor to be activated by
various forms or shapes of mud spots or pollution on the road or lens, enabling
adaptation to changes in vehicle observation viewpoints during driving. To
mitigate the effects of environmental changes, we design a meta-learning
framework to train meta-generators tailored to different environmental
conditions. These generators produce meta-triggers that incorporate diverse
environmental information, such as weather or lighting conditions, as the
initialization of the trigger patterns for backdoor implantation, thus enabling
adaptation to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on various commonly
used LD models in both digital and physical domains validate the effectiveness
of our attacks, outperforming other baselines significantly (+25.15% on average
in Attack Success Rate). Our codes will be available upon paper publication.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05553v3

experience significant anatomical change during radiotherapy (RT) is important
to optimize patient clinical benefit and treatment resources. This study aims
to assess the feasibility of using a vision-transformer (ViT) based neural
network to predict RT-induced anatomic change in HNC patients. We
retrospectively included 121 HNC patients treated with definitive RT/CRT. We
collected the planning CT (pCT), planned dose, CBCTs acquired at the initial
treatment (CBCT01) and fraction 21 (CBCT21), and primary tumor volume (GTVp)
and involved nodal volume (GTVn) delineated on both pCT and CBCTs for model
construction and evaluation. A UNet-style ViT network was designed to learn
spatial correspondence and contextual information from embedded CT, dose,
CBCT01, GTVp, and GTVn image patches. The model estimated the deformation
vector field between CBCT01 and CBCT21 as the prediction of anatomic change,
and deformed CBCT01 was used as the prediction of CBCT21. We also generated
binary masks of GTVp, GTVn, and patient body for volumetric change evaluation.
The predicted image from the proposed method yielded the best similarity to the
real image (CBCT21) over pCT, CBCT01, and predicted CBCTs from other comparison
models. The average MSE and SSIM between the normalized predicted CBCT to
CBCT21 are 0.009 and 0.933, while the average dice coefficient between body
mask, GTVp mask, and GTVn mask are 0.972, 0.792, and 0.821 respectively. The

"Diffusion-RSCC: Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Change Captioning in
  Remote Sensing Images",2024-05-21T15:44:31Z,"Xiaofei Yu, Yitong Li, Jie Ma","Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims at generating human-like
language to describe the semantic changes between bi-temporal remote sensing
image pairs. It provides valuable insights into environmental dynamics and land
management. Unlike conventional change captioning task, RSICC involves not only
retrieving relevant information across different modalities and generating
fluent captions, but also mitigating the impact of pixel-level differences on
terrain change localization. The pixel problem due to long time span decreases
the accuracy of generated caption. Inspired by the remarkable generative power
of diffusion model, we propose a probabilistic diffusion model for RSICC to
solve the aforementioned problems. In training process, we construct a noise
predictor conditioned on cross modal features to learn the distribution from
the real caption distribution to the standard Gaussian distribution under the
Markov chain. Meanwhile, a cross-mode fusion and a stacking self-attention
module are designed for noise predictor in the reverse process. In testing
phase, the well-trained noise predictor helps to estimate the mean value of the
distribution and generate change captions step by step. Extensive experiments
on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our Diffusion-RSCC and
its individual components. The quantitative results showcase superior

identity-related auxiliary modalities (e.g., sketches, silhouettes, keypoints

relying on unpractical and inflexible auxiliary modalities or annotations

pedestrian images without the need for any auxiliaries. Specifically, we
propose the Content and Salient Semantics Collaboration (CSSC) framework,
facilitating cross-parallel semantics interaction and refinement. Our framework
is simple yet effective, and the vital design is the Semantics Mining and
Refinement (SMR) module. It extracts robust identity features about content and

  Models with a Multi-task Evaluation Dataset",2024-06-04T08:35:04Z,"Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song","To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with
generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the
reasoning ability to comprehend situational changes (transitions) in
distribution triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents.
Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to
the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their
associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with
situational transitions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation
of reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative
process, termed as MetAphysical ReaSoning. We then introduce the first-ever
benchmark, MARS, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step. These tasks
systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i)
changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii)
situational transitions driven by changes in action. Extensive evaluations with
20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this

applications in environmental monitoring, urban development, and disaster
management. CD involves utilizing bi-temporal images to identify changes over
time. The bi-temporal spatial relationships between features at the same
location at different times play a key role in this process. However, existing
change detection networks often do not fully leverage these spatial
relationships during bi-temporal feature extraction and fusion. In this work,
we propose SRC-Net: a bi-temporal spatial relationship concerned network for
CD. The proposed SRC-Net includes a Perception and Interaction Module that
incorporates spatial relationships and establishes a cross-branch perception
mechanism to enhance the precision and robustness of feature extraction.
Additionally, a Patch-Mode joint Feature Fusion Module is introduced to address
information loss in current methods. It considers different change modes and
concerns about spatial relationships, resulting in more expressive fusion
features. Furthermore, we construct a novel network using these two
relationship concerned modules and conducted experiments on the LEVIR-CD and
WHU Building datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining a modest

Streaming Algorithms with Few State Changes,2024-06-10T22:09:42Z,"Rajesh Jayaram, David P. Woodruff, Samson Zhou","In this paper, we study streaming algorithms that minimize the number of
changes made to their internal state (i.e., memory contents). While the design
of streaming algorithms typically focuses on minimizing space and update time,
these metrics fail to capture the asymmetric costs, inherent in modern hardware
and database systems, of reading versus writing to memory. In fact, most
streaming algorithms write to their memory on every update, which is
undesirable when writing is significantly more expensive than reading. This
raises the question of whether streaming algorithms with small space and number
of memory writes are possible.
  We first demonstrate that, for the fundamental $F_p$ moment estimation
problem with $p\ge 1$, any streaming algorithm that achieves a constant factor
approximation must make $\Omega(n^{1-1/p})$ internal state changes, regardless
of how much space it uses. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this lower bound
can be matched by an algorithm that also has near-optimal space complexity.
Specifically, we give a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $F_p$
moment estimation that uses a near-optimal
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_\varepsilon(n^{1-1/p})$ number of state changes, while
simultaneously achieving near-optimal space, i.e., for $p\in[1,2]$, our
algorithm uses $\text{poly}\left(\log n,\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ bits of
space, while for $p>2$, the algorithm uses
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_\varepsilon(n^{1-2/p})$ space. We similarly design
streaming algorithms that are simultaneously near-optimal in both space
complexity and the number of state changes for the heavy-hitters problem,
sparse support recovery, and entropy estimation. Our results demonstrate that
an optimal number of state changes can be achieved without sacrificing space
complexity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06821v1
