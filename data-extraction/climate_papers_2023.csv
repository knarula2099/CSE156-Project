Baumol's Climate Disease,2023-11-30T19:45:13Z,"Fangzhi Wang, Hua Liao, Richard S. J. Tol","We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium
climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the
production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon
can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we
distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate
vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability
results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if
climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact
can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less
(more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not
only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost
and climate diseases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00160v1
Hurricanes Increase Climate Change Conversations on Twitter,2023-05-12T14:46:26Z,"Maddalena Torricelli, Max Falkenberg, Alessandro Galeazzi, Fabiana Zollo, Walter Quattrociocchi, Andrea Baronchelli","The public understanding of climate change plays a critical role in
translating climate science into climate action. In the public discourse,
climate impacts are often discussed in the context of extreme weather events.
Here, we analyse 65 million Twitter posts and 240 thousand news media articles
related to 18 major hurricanes from 2010 to 2022 to clarify how hurricanes
impact the public discussion around climate change. First, we analyse news
content and show that climate change is the most prominent non-hurricane
specific topic discussed by the news media in relation to hurricanes. Second,
we perform a comparative analysis between reliable and questionable news media
outlets, finding that the language around climate change varies between news
media providers. Finally, using geolocated data, we show that accounts in
regions affected by hurricanes discuss climate change at a significantly higher
rate than accounts in unaffected areas, with references to climate change
increasing by, on average, 80% after impact, and up to 200% for the largest
hurricanes. Our findings demonstrate how hurricanes have a key impact on the
public awareness of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07529v1
ClimateSet: A Large-Scale Climate Model Dataset for Machine Learning,2023-11-07T04:55:36Z,"Julia Kaltenborn, Charlotte E. E. Lange, Venkatesh Ramesh, Philippe Brouillard, Yaniv Gurwicz, Chandni Nagda, Jakob Runge, Peer Nowack, David Rolnick","Climate models have been key for assessing the impact of climate change and
simulating future climate scenarios. The machine learning (ML) community has
taken an increased interest in supporting climate scientists' efforts on
various tasks such as climate model emulation, downscaling, and prediction
tasks. Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single
climate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have
suggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and
ML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset
containing the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and
CMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for
retrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We
showcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based
climate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and
generalization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their
performance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be
used to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one.
Such a ""super emulator"" can quickly project new climate change scenarios,
complementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers. We believe
ClimateSet will create the basis needed for the ML community to tackle
climate-related tasks at scale.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03721v1

platforms. Individuals utilize platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to
express their opinions, thoughts, and critiques on diverse subjects,
encompassing the pressing issue of climate change. The proliferation of climate
change-related content on social media necessitates comprehensive analysis to

Climate Change from Large Language Models,2023-12-19T09:26:46Z,"Hongyin Zhu, Prayag Tiwari","Climate change poses grave challenges, demanding widespread understanding and
low-carbon lifestyle awareness. Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful
tool to address this crisis, yet comprehensive evaluations of their

hybrid approach for data acquisition, combining data synthesis and manual
collection, to compile a diverse set of questions encompassing various aspects
of climate change. Utilizing prompt engineering based on the compiled
questions, we evaluate the model's knowledge by analyzing its generated
answers. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive set of metrics to assess
climate-crisis knowledge, encompassing indicators from 10 distinct
perspectives. These metrics provide a multifaceted evaluation, enabling a
nuanced understanding of the LLMs' climate crisis comprehension. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. In our

advantage of the stochasticity associated with fast weather processes to probe
the slow dynamics of the climate system. This has led to fundamentally new ways
to study the response of climate models to perturbations, and to perform
detection and attribution for climate change signals. Hasselmann's program has
been extremely influential in climate science and beyond. We first summarise
the main aspects of such a program using modern concepts and tools of
statistical physics and applied mathematics. We then provide an overview of
some promising scientific perspectives that might better clarify the science
behind the climate crisis and that stem from Hasselmann's ideas. We show how to
perform rigorous model reduction by constructing parametrizations in systems
that do not necessarily feature a time-scale separation between unresolved and
resolved processes. We propose a general framework for explaining the
relationship between climate variability and climate change, and for performing
climate change projections. This leads us seamlessly to explain some key
general aspects of climatic tipping points. Finally, we show that response
theory provides a solid framework supporting optimal fingerprinting methods for
detection and attribution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12009v3
"Climate uncertainty impacts on optimal mitigation pathways and social
  cost of carbon",2023-04-18T12:47:51Z,"Christopher J. Smith, Alaa Al Khourdajie, Pu Yang, Doris Folini","Emissions pathways used in climate policy analysis are often derived from
integrated assessment models. However, such emissions pathways do not typically
include climate feedbacks on socioeconomic systems and by extension do not
consider climate uncertainty in their construction. We use a well-known
cost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated
Climate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the
Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty
in FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically
observed climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed
ranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity. Three
scenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the ""optimal welfare"" scenario of
DICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that
limit warming to ""well-below"" 2C and 1.5C with low overshoot, in line with
Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is
responsible for a factor of five variation (5-95% range) in the social cost of
carbon in the 1.5C scenario. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the
optimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to
climate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from -12 to +14 GtCO2/yr in
the 1.5C scenario. Equilibrium climate sensitivity and the strength of
present-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of
social cost of carbon and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing
climate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of
carbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions
abatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment
model derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in
scenario construction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08957v3

as a serious threat to national security. Climate intervention methods, such as
stratospheric aerosol injection, have been proposed as mitigation strategies,
but the downstream effects of such actions on a complex climate system are not
well understood. The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifying
relationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event
(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deep
learning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinear
relationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variable
relationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)
for characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficient
neural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposes
ESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like other
neural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses a
hurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue by
developing feature importance methods for ESNs in the context of
spatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.
We conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importance
techniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In the
climate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcanic

roles in the climate, and current models predict shifts in their strength and

characterizing and tracking changes in ocean physics in complex models. Using
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a case study, we extend the method
Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) to a mesoscale eddy
permitting climate model and identify regions of the ocean characterized by
similar physics, called dynamical regimes, using readily accessible fields from
climate models. To this end, we cluster grid cells into dynamical regimes and
train an ensemble of neural networks, allowing uncertainty quantification, to
predict these regimes and track them under climate change. Finally, we leverage
this new knowledge to elucidate the dynamical drivers of the identified regime
shifts as noted by the neural network using the 'explainability' methods SHAP
and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. A region undergoing a profound shift is
where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intersects the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge,
an area important for carbon draw-down and fisheries. In this region, THOR
specifically reveals a shift in dynamical regime under climate change driven by
changes in wind stress and interactions with bathymetry. Using this knowledge

Furthermore, such data is measured at many spatial locations on Earth, which
motivates accommodating sets of functional time series that are

We use Meta's Ad Library to collect 602,546 ads that have been issued by US
Congress members since mid-2018. Out of those only 19,176 (3.2%) are
climate-related. Analyzing this data, we find that Democrats focus
substantially more on climate change than Republicans, with 99.7% of all
climate-related ads stemming from Democratic politicians. In particular, we
find this is driven by a small core of Democratic politicians, where 72% of all
impressions can be attributed to 10 politicians. Interestingly, we find a
significant difference in the average amount of impressions generated per
dollar spent between the two parties. Republicans generate on average 188% more
impressions with their climate ads for the same money spent as Democrats. We
build models to explain the differences and find that demographic factors only
partially explain the variance. Our results demonstrate differences of
climate-related advertisements of US congress members and reveal differences in
advertising characteristics between the two political parties. We anticipate
our work to be a starting point for further studies about climate-related ads

"Factors other than climate change are currently more important in
  predicting how well fruit farms are doing financially",2023-01-11T18:22:31Z,"Fabian Obster, Heidi Bohle, Paul M. Pechan","Machine learning and statistical modeling methods were used to analyze the
impact of climate change on financial wellbeing of fruit farmers in Tunisia and
Chile. The analysis was based on face to face interviews with 801 farmers.
Three research questions were investigated. First, whether climate change
impacts had an effect on how well the farm was doing financially. Second, if
climate change was not influential, what factors were important for predicting
financial wellbeing of the farm. And third, ascertain whether observed effects
on the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between
predictor variables. This is the first report directly comparing climate change
with other factors potentially impacting financial wellbeing of farms. Certain
climate change factors, namely increases in temperature and reductions in
precipitation, can regionally impact self-perceived financial wellbeing of
fruit farmers. Specifically, increases in temperature and reduction in
precipitation can have a measurable negative impact on the financial wellbeing
of farms in Chile. This effect is less pronounced in Tunisia. Climate impact
differences were observed within Chile but not in Tunisia. However, climate
change is only of minor importance for predicting farm financial wellbeing,
especially for farms already doing financially well. Factors that are more
important, mainly in Tunisia, included trust in information sources and prior
farm ownership. Other important factors include farm size, water management
systems used and diversity of fruit crops grown. Moreover, some of the
important factors identified differed between farms doing and not doing well
financially. Interactions between factors may improve or worsen farm financial
wellbeing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07685v1

improve the uncertainty quantification of statistical downscaling models. By
better capturing uncertainty, statistical downscaling models allow for superior
planning against extreme weather events, a source of various negative social

study, a novel method called Wasserstein Stability Analysis (WSA) is developed
to identify PDF changes, especially the extreme event shift and non-linear
physical value constraint variation in climate change. WSA is applied to
21st-century warming slowdown period and is compared with traditional
mean-value trend analysis. The result indicates that despite no significant
trend, the central-eastern Pacific experienced a decline in hot extremes and an
increase in cold extremes, indicating a La Nina-like temperature shift. Further
analysis at two Arctic locations suggests sea ice severely restricts the hot

"Economic consequences of the spatial and temporal variability of climate
  change",2023-04-17T08:07:11Z,"Francisco Estrada, Richard S. J. Tol, Wouter Botzen","Damage functions in integrated assessment models (IAMs) map changes in
climate to economic impacts and form the basis for most of estimates of the
social cost of carbon. Implicit in these functions lies an unwarranted
assumption that restricts the spatial variation (Svar) and temporal variability
(Tvar) of changes in climate to be null. This could bias damage estimates and
the climate policy advice from IAMs. While the effects of Tvar have been
studied in the literature, those of Svar and their interactions with Tvar have
not. Here we present estimates of the economic costs of climate change that
account for both Tvar and Svar, as well as for the seasonality of damages
across sectors. Contrary to the results of recent studies which show little
effect that of Tvar on expected losses, we reveal that ignoring Svar produces
large downward biases, as warming is highly heterogeneous over space. Using a
conservative calibration for the damage function, we show that previous
estimates are biased downwards by about 23-36%, which represents additional
losses of about US$1,400-US$2,300 billion by 2050 and US$17-US$28 trillion by
the end of the century, under a high emissions scenario. The present value of
losses during the period 2020-2100 would be larger than reported in previous
studies by $47-$66 trillion or about 1/2 to 3/4 of annual global GDP in 2020.
Our results imply that using global mean temperature change in IAMs as a
summary measure of warming is not adequate for estimating the costs of climate
change. Instead, IAMs should include a more complete description of climate
conditions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08049v1

Endogenous preference for non-market goods in carbon abatement decision,2023-12-18T08:15:32Z,"Fangzhi Wang, Hua Liao, Richard S. J. Tol, Changjing Ji","Carbon abatement decisions are usually based on the implausible assumption of
constant social preference. This paper focuses on a specific case of market and
non-market goods, and investigates the optimal climate policy when social
preference for them is also changed by climate policy in the DICE model. The
relative price of non-market goods grows over time due to increases in both
relative scarcity and appreciation of it. Therefore, climbing relative price
brings upward the social cost of carbon denominated in terms of market goods.
Because abatement decision affects the valuation of non-market goods in the
utility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model
iteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs
in the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more
stringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy
raises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%-18% this century.
Moreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of
non-market goods damages by 15%. Our results support that climate policy is
self-reinforced if it favors more expensive consumption type.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11010v1

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are well-suited to such a problem due to
their ability to implicitly learn the distribution of data in high-dimensional

long-standing biases and uncertainties in their projections remain. This is
largely associated with the representation of subgrid-scale processes,
particularly clouds and convection. Deep learning can learn these subgrid-scale
processes from computationally expensive storm-resolving models while retaining
many features at a fraction of computational cost. Yet, climate simulations
with embedded neural network parameterizations are still challenging and highly
depend on the deep learning solution. This is likely associated with spurious
non-physical correlations learned by the neural networks due to the complexity
of the physical dynamical system. Here, we show that the combination of
causality with deep learning helps removing spurious correlations and
optimizing the neural network algorithm. To resolve this, we apply a causal
discovery method to unveil causal drivers in the set of input predictors of
atmospheric subgrid-scale processes of a superparameterized climate model in
which deep convection is explicitly resolved. The resulting causally-informed
neural networks are coupled to the climate model, hence, replacing the
superparameterization and radiation scheme. We show that the climate
simulations with causally-informed neural network parameterizations retain many
convection-related properties and accurately generate the climate of the
original high-resolution climate model, while retaining similar generalization
capabilities to unseen climates compared to the non-causal approach. The
combination of causal discovery and deep learning is a new and promising
approach that leads to stable and more trustworthy climate simulations and
paves the way towards more physically-based causal deep learning approaches
also in other scientific disciplines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12952v4

Shifting Climates: Climate Change Communication from YouTube to TikTok,2023-12-08T11:10:10Z,"Arianna Pera, Luca Maria Aiello","Public discourse on critical issues such as climate change is progressively
shifting to social media platforms that prioritize short-form video content.
Content creators acting on those platforms play a pivotal role in shaping the
discourse, yet the dynamics of communication and audience reactions across
platforms remain underexplored. To improve our understanding of this
transition, we studied the video content produced by 21 prominent YouTube
creators who have expanded their influence to TikTok as information
disseminators. Using dictionary-based tools and BERT-based embeddings, we
analyzed the transcripts of nearly 7k climate-related videos across both
platforms and the 574k comments they received. We found that, when publishing
on TikTok, creators use a more emotionally resonant, self-referential, and
action-oriented language compared to YouTube. We also observed a strong
semantic alignment between videos and comments, with creators who excel at
diversifying their TikTok content from YouTube typically receiving responses

Climate change heterogeneity: A new quantitative approach,2023-01-06T18:49:24Z,"Maria Dolores Gadea, Jesus Gonzalo","Climate change is a non-uniform phenomenon. This paper proposes a new
quantitative methodology to characterize, measure, and test the existence of
climate change heterogeneity. It consists of three steps. First, we introduce a
new testable warming typology based on the evolution of the trend of the whole
temperature distribution and not only on the average. Second, we define the
concepts of warming acceleration and warming amplification in a testable
format. And third, we introduce the new testable concept of warming dominance
to determine whether region A is suffering a worse warming process than region
B. Applying this three-step methodology, we find that Spain and the Globe
experience a clear distributional warming process (beyond the standard average)
but of different types. In both cases, this process is accelerating over time
and asymmetrically amplified. Overall, warming in Spain dominates the Globe in
all the quantiles except the lower tail of the global temperature distribution
that corresponds to the Arctic region. Our climate change heterogeneity results
open the door to the need for a non-uniform causal-effect climate analysis that
goes beyond the standard causality in mean as well as for a more efficient
design of the mitigation-adaptation policies. In particular, the heterogeneity
we find suggests that these policies should contain a common global component
and a clear local-regional element. Future climate agreements should take the

  forcing: a climate change example",2023-09-21T19:48:42Z,"Francisco de Melo Viríssimo, David A. Stainforth, Jochen Bröcker","Complex Earth System Models are widely utilised to make conditional
statements about the future climate under some assumptions about changes in
future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations; these statements are often
referred to as climate projections. The models themselves are high-dimensional
nonlinear systems and it is common to discuss their behaviour in terms of
attractors and low-dimensional nonlinear systems such as the canonical Lorenz
`63 system. In a non-autonomous situation, for instance due to anthropogenic
climate change, the relevant object is sometimes considered to be the pullback
or snapshot attractor. The pullback attractor, however, is a collection of {\em
all} plausible states of the system at a given time and therefore does not take
into consideration our knowledge of the current state of the Earth System when
making climate projections, and are therefore not very informative regarding
annual to multi-decadal climate projections. In this article, we approach the
problem of measuring and interpreting the mid-term climate of a model by using
a low-dimensional, climate-like, nonlinear system with three timescales of
variability, and non-periodic forcing. We introduce the concept of an {\em
evolution set} which is dependent on the starting state of the system, and
explore its links to different types of initial condition uncertainty and the
rate of external forcing. We define the {\em convergence time} as the time that
it takes for the distribution of one of the dependent variables to lose memory
of its initial conditions. We suspect a connection between convergence times
and the classical concept of mixing times but the precise nature of this
connection needs to be explored. These results have implications for the design
of influential climate and Earth System Model ensembles, and raise a number of

SLO/GO Degradation-Loss Sensitivity in Climate-Human System Coupling,2023-11-29T18:54:50Z,"Sierra Cabrera, Irina Babayan, Hazhir Aliahmadi, Dongmei Chen, Greg van Anders","The potential of extreme environmental change driven by a destabilized
climate system is an alarming prospect for humanity. But the intricate, subtle
ways Earth's climate couples to social and economic systems raise the question
of when more incremental climate change signals the need for alarm. Questions
about incremental sensitivity are particularly crucial for human systems that
are organized by optimization. Optimization is most valuable in resolving
complex interactions among multiple factors, however, those interactions can
obscure coupling to underlying drivers such as environmental degradation. Here,
using Multi-Objective Land Allocation as an example, we show that model
features that are common across non-convex optimization problems drive
hypersensitivities in climate-induced degradation--loss response. We show that
catastrophic losses in human systems can occur well before catastrophic climate
collapse. We find punctuated insensitive/hypersensitive degradation--loss
response, which we trace to the contrasting effects of environmental
degradation on subleading, local versus global optima (SLO/GO). We argue that
the SLO/GO response we identify in land-allocation problems traces to features
that are common across non-convex optimization problems more broadly. Given the
broad range of human systems that rely on non-convex optimization, our results
therefore suggest that substantial social and economic risks could be lurking

considerable threats to forest herb populations, especially when compounded by

we conducted a garden experiment with Primula elatior offspring from 24
populations across a climate and landscape fragmentation gradient. We evaluated
vegetative, regulatory, and reproductive traits under different soil moisture

conducted a field study in 60 populations along the same gradient to examine
potential breakdown of reciprocal herkogamy. Our results showed an evolutionary
shift from drought avoidance in southern populations to drought tolerance in

disrupted climate clines and adaptive responses to drought in key traits
related to growth, biomass allocation and water regulation. Our findings also
indicate the beginning of an evolutionary breakdown in reciprocal herkogamy.
These disruptions resulted in significantly reduced flowering investment,

to SAR amplitude data covering 8.7\% of the Earth's land surface area, and tune
the pretrained weights on two downstream tasks crucial to monitoring climate
change - vegetation cover prediction and land cover classification. We show
that the use of this pretraining scheme reduces labelling requirements for the
downstream tasks by more than an order of magnitude, and that this pretraining
generalises geographically, with the performance gain increasing when tuned
downstream on regions outside the pretraining set. Our findings significantly
advance climate change mitigation by facilitating the development of task and
region-specific SAR models, allowing local communities and organizations to
deploy tailored solutions for rapid, accurate monitoring of climate change

"Bayesian Optimisation Against Climate Change: Applications and
  Benchmarks",2023-06-07T11:17:07Z,"Sigrid Passano Hellan, Christopher G. Lucas, Nigel H. Goddard","Bayesian optimisation is a powerful method for optimising black-box
functions, popular in settings where the true function is expensive to evaluate
and no gradient information is available. Bayesian optimisation can improve
responses to many optimisation problems within climate change for which
simulator models are unavailable or expensive to sample from. While there have
been several feasibility demonstrations of Bayesian optimisation in
climate-related applications, there has been no unifying review of applications
and benchmarks. We provide such a review here, to encourage the use of Bayesian
optimisation in important and well-suited application domains. We identify four
main application domains: material discovery, wind farm layout, optimal
renewable control and environmental monitoring. For each domain we identify a
public benchmark or data set that is easy to use and evaluate systems against,
while being representative of real-world problems. Due to the lack of a
suitable benchmark for environmental monitoring, we propose LAQN-BO, based on
air pollution data. Our contributions are: a) identifying a representative
range of benchmarks, providing example code where necessary; b) introducing a
new benchmark, LAQN-BO; and c) promoting a wider use of climate change
applications among Bayesian optimisation practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04343v1

policies, a multilateral approach is needed to make an impact on the growing
threats facing the environment. Through the use of systematic analysis by way
of C-ROADS and En-ROADS, numerous scenarios have been simulated to shed light
on the most imperative policy factors to mitigate climate change. Within
C-ROADS, it was determined that the impacts of the shrinking ice-albedo effect
on global temperatures is significant, however differential sea ice melting
between the poles may not impact human dwellings, as all regions are impacted
by sea ice melt. Flood risks are also becoming more imminent, specifically in
high population density areas. In terms of afforestation, China is the emerging
leader, and if other countries follow suit, this can incur substantial
dividends. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of global trends through
En-ROADS, intriguing patterns appear between the length of a policy initiative,
and its effectiveness. Quick policies with gradual increases in taxation proved
successful. Government intervention was also favorable, however an optimized
model is presented, with moderate subsidization of renewable energy. Through
this systematic analysis of assumptions and policy for effective climate change
mitigation efforts, an optimized, economically-favorable solution arises.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03546v1
Wavelet Coherence Of Total Solar Irradiance and Atlantic Climate,2023-05-03T17:59:05Z,"Vasil Kolev, Yavor Chapanov","The oscillations of climatic parameters of North Atlantic Ocean play
important role in various events in North America and Europe. Several climatic
indices are associated with these oscillations. The long term Atlantic
temperature anomalies are described by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
(AMO). The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation also known as Atlantic
Multidecadal Variability (AMV), is the variability of the sea surface
temperature (SST) of the North Atlantic Ocean at the timescale of several
decades. The AMO is correlated to air temperatures and rainfall over much of
the Northern Hemisphere, in particular in the summer climate in North America
and Europe. The long-term variations of surface temperature are driven mainly
by the cycles of solar activity, represented by the variations of the Total
Solar Irradiance (TSI). The frequency and amplitude dependences between the TSI
and AMO are analyzed by wavelet coherence of millennial time series since 800
AD till now. The results of wavelet coherence are compared with the detected
common solar and climate cycles in narrow frequency bands by the method of
Partial Fourier Approximation. The long-term coherence between TSI and AMO can

studying regional climate variability and change. However, their high
computational cost limits the production of comprehensive ensembles of regional
climate projections covering multiple scenarios and driving Global Climate
Models (GCMs) across regions. RCM emulators based on deep learning models have
recently been introduced as a cost-effective and promising alternative that
requires only short RCM simulations to train the models. Therefore, evaluating
their transferability to different periods, scenarios, and GCMs becomes a
pivotal and complex task in which the inherent biases of both GCMs and RCMs
play a significant role. Here we focus on this problem by considering the two
different emulation approaches proposed in the literature (PP and MOS,
following the terminology introduced in this paper). In addition to standard
evaluation techniques, we expand the analysis with methods from the field of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), to assess the physical consistency
of the empirical links learnt by the models. We find that both approaches are
able to emulate certain climatological properties of RCMs for different periods
and scenarios (soft transferability), but the consistency of the emulation
functions differ between approaches. Whereas PP learns robust and physically
meaningful patterns, MOS results are GCM-dependent and lack physical
consistency in some cases. Both approaches face problems when transferring the
emulation function to other GCMs, due to the existence of GCM-dependent biases
(hard transferability). This limits their applicability to build ensembles of
regional climate projections. We conclude by giving some prospects for future
applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03378v1

the frequency of dry climate conditions. Under these climate conditions,
human-related actions that initiate wildfires should be avoided, including

vulnerable parts of the grid so as to decrease the probability of wildfire
ignition. Within this framework, the proposed model captures the relationship
between failure probabilities and line-flow decisions by explicitly considering
the former as a function of the latter. The resulting formulation is a
two-stage model with endogenous decision-dependent probabilities, where the
first stage determines the optimal switching actions and the second stage

criteria for a significant subset of a corpus in order to train the supervised
model. Even labeling a few hundred documents with human subject-matter experts
is a time-consuming process. To expedite this process, we developed a weak
supervision-based NLP approach that leverages semantic similarity between
categories and documents to (i) establish a topic-specific corpus by subsetting
a large-scale open-access corpus and (ii) generate category labels for the

without depriving any of the systems of its fundamental strengths is hence
deemed necessary. We apply a transdisciplinary framework for knowledge
co-production involving international researchers and reindeer herders from
different cooperatives in northern Finland. Through climate change adaptation
stories, we co-explore how climate predictions can inform herders decision
making during the herding season. Relevant decisions include the anticipation
of summer harvest time, the inopportune periods of cold weather in spring, and
insect harassment in summer. The analysis of two different adaptation stories
shows that seasonal predictions of temperature for May and June can
successfully advise about the likelihood of having an earlier than normal
harvest. Likewise, sub-seasonal predictions of temperature during April and May
can be useful to anticipate the occurrence of backwinter episodes, which can
support herders in deciding whether to feed reindeer in pens for longer,
avoiding putting the survival of calves at risk. This study, which would
benefit from co-evaluation in real world settings and consideration of
additional adaptation stories, sets the basis for a successful co-production of

Impact of Changing Greenhouse Gas Concentrations on Ontario's Climate,2023-05-09T14:51:47Z,W. A. van Wijngaarden,"The effect of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on climate was examined.
Calculations of the climate sensitivity, the warming of the Earth due to a
doubling of atmospheric CO2, are discussed. Ontario was responsible for 0.35%
of the world's CO2 emissions in 2019 and this amount was 20% lower than in
2005. The predictions of Global Climate Models (GCM) were compared to
observations. Records since 1880 show an overall warming of about 1 C. The GCMs
do not account for observed decadal temperature fluctuations and consistently
overestimate the warming. Ontario's contribution to global warming is only 9.2
x 10^{-5} C/year using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
recommended climate sensitivity value. Measurements of the polar ice caps
reveal a decrease in the minimum September Arctic sea ice extent during
1979-2022 but the trend levelled off after 2007; while the average Antarctic
sea ice extent slightly increased. Sea level increased slightly throughout the
20th century. Ontario's contribution to anthropogenic sea level rise is about
0.005 mm/year. Sea level along Ontario's Hudson Bay coast is decreasing due to
isostatic rebound of the land following the last Ice Age. The change to ocean
acidity due to CO2 absorption from the atmosphere is negligible compared to
that due to tides, ocean depth and seasonal effects. Ontario's contribution to
ocean acidification is estimated to be 6 x 10^{-6} pH/year. No changes in
precipitation in North America over the 19th and 20th centuries, nor at Toronto
since 1843, were found. The Great Lake levels are remarkably constant over the
past century showing no evidence of a change in the incidence of flooding. No

production practices that minimize water, land, and energy use while improving

being developed to boost yields while decreasing operating expenses. Crop yield
prediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of the complex and
nonlinear impacts of cultivar, soil type, management, pest and disease,
climate, and weather patterns on crops. To solve this issue, we employ machine
learning (ML) to forecast production while considering climate change, soil
diversity, cultivar, and inorganic nitrogen levels. From the 1980s to the
1990s, field data were gathered across the southern cotton belt of the United
States. To capture the most current effects of climate change over the previous
six years, a second data source was produced using the process-based crop

Effects of Ozone Levels on Climate Through Earth History,2023-05-24T18:00:12Z,"Russell Deitrick, Colin Goldblatt","Molecular oxygen in our atmosphere has increased from less than a part per
million in the Archean Eon, to a fraction of a percent in the Proterozoic, and
finally to modern levels during the Phanerozoic. The ozone layer formed with
the early Proterozoic oxygenation. While oxygen itself has only minor radiative
and climatic effects, the accompanying ozone has important consequences for
Earth climate. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a 3-D general
circulation model, we test the effects of various levels of ozone on Earth's
climate. When CO2 is held constant, the global mean surface temperature
decreases with decreasing ozone, with a maximum drop of ~3.5 K at near total
ozone removal. By supplementing our GCM results with 1-D radiative flux
calculations, we are able to test which changes to the atmosphere are
responsible for this temperature change. We find that the surface temperature
change is caused mostly by the stratosphere being much colder when ozone is
absent; this makes it drier, substantially weakening the greenhouse effect. We
also examine the effect of the structure of the upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere on the formation of clouds, and on the global circulation. At low
ozone, both high and low clouds become more abundant, due to changes in the
tropospheric stability. These generate opposing short-wave and long-wave
radiative forcings that are nearly equal. The Hadley circulation and
tropospheric jet streams are strengthened, while the stratospheric polar jets
are weakened, the latter being a direct consequence of the change in
stratospheric temperatures. This work identifies the major climatic impacts of
ozone, an important piece of the evolution of Earth's atmosphere.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15477v2
