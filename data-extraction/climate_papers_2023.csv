Baumol's Climate Disease,2023-11-30T19:45:13Z,"Fangzhi Wang, Hua Liao, Richard S. J. Tol","We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium
climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the
production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon
can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we
distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate
vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability
results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if
climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact
can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less
(more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not
only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost
and climate diseases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00160v1
Hurricanes Increase Climate Change Conversations on Twitter,2023-05-12T14:46:26Z,"Maddalena Torricelli, Max Falkenberg, Alessandro Galeazzi, Fabiana Zollo, Walter Quattrociocchi, Andrea Baronchelli","The public understanding of climate change plays a critical role in
translating climate science into climate action. In the public discourse,
climate impacts are often discussed in the context of extreme weather events.
Here, we analyse 65 million Twitter posts and 240 thousand news media articles
related to 18 major hurricanes from 2010 to 2022 to clarify how hurricanes
impact the public discussion around climate change. First, we analyse news
content and show that climate change is the most prominent non-hurricane
specific topic discussed by the news media in relation to hurricanes. Second,
we perform a comparative analysis between reliable and questionable news media
outlets, finding that the language around climate change varies between news
media providers. Finally, using geolocated data, we show that accounts in
regions affected by hurricanes discuss climate change at a significantly higher
rate than accounts in unaffected areas, with references to climate change
increasing by, on average, 80% after impact, and up to 200% for the largest
hurricanes. Our findings demonstrate how hurricanes have a key impact on the
public awareness of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07529v1
ClimateSet: A Large-Scale Climate Model Dataset for Machine Learning,2023-11-07T04:55:36Z,"Julia Kaltenborn, Charlotte E. E. Lange, Venkatesh Ramesh, Philippe Brouillard, Yaniv Gurwicz, Chandni Nagda, Jakob Runge, Peer Nowack, David Rolnick","Climate models have been key for assessing the impact of climate change and
simulating future climate scenarios. The machine learning (ML) community has
taken an increased interest in supporting climate scientists' efforts on
various tasks such as climate model emulation, downscaling, and prediction
tasks. Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single
climate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have
suggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and
ML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset
containing the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and
CMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for
retrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We
showcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based
climate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and
generalization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their
performance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be
used to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one.
Such a ""super emulator"" can quickly project new climate change scenarios,
complementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers. We believe
ClimateSet will create the basis needed for the ML community to tackle
climate-related tasks at scale.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03721v1
Leveraging machine learning to enhance climate models: a review,2023-11-15T22:30:32Z,"Ahmed Elsayed, Shrouk Wally, Islam Alkabbany, Asem Ali, Aly Farag","Recent achievements in machine learning (Ml) have had a significant impact on
various fields, including climate science. Climate modeling is very important
and plays a crucial role in shaping the decisions of governments and
individuals in mitigating the impact of climate change. Climate change poses a
serious threat to humanity, however, current climate models are limited by
computational costs, uncertainties, and biases, affecting their prediction
accuracy. The vast amount of climate data generated by satellites, radars, and
earth system models (ESMS) poses a significant challenge. ML techniques can be
effectively employed to analyze this data and extract valuable insights that
aid in our understanding of the earth climate. This review paper focuses on how
ml has been utilized in the last 5 years to boost the current state-of-the-art
climate models. We invite the ml community to join in the global effort to
accurately model the earth climate by collaborating with other fields to
leverage ml as a powerful tool in this endeavor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09413v1
"Understanding the Impact of Seasonal Climate Change on Canada's Economy
  by Region and Sector",2023-11-06T20:12:07Z,"Shiyu He, Trang Bui, Yuying Huang, Wenling Zhang, Jie Jian, Samuel W. K. Wong, Tony S. Wirjanto","To assess the impact of climate change on the Canadian economy, we
investigate and model the relationship between seasonal climate variables and
economic growth across provinces and economic sectors. We further provide
projections of climate change impacts up to the year 2050, taking into account
the diverse climate change patterns and economic conditions across Canada. Our
results indicate that rising Fall temperature anomalies have a notable adverse
impact on Canadian economic growth. Province-wide, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
are anticipated to experience the most substantial declines, whereas British
Columbia and the Maritime provinces will be less impacted. Industry-wide,
Mining is projected to see the greatest benefits, while Agriculture and
Manufacturing are projected to have the most significant downturns. The
disparities of climate change effects between provinces and industries
highlight the need for governments to tailor their policies accordingly, and
offer targeted assistance to regions and industries that are particularly
vulnerable in the face of climate change. Targeted approaches to climate change
mitigation are likely to be more effective than one-size-fits-all policies for
the whole economy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03497v1
"ClimateNLP: Analyzing Public Sentiment Towards Climate Change Using
  Natural Language Processing",2023-10-12T07:48:50Z,"Ajay Krishnan, V. S. Anoop","Climate change's impact on human health poses unprecedented and diverse
challenges. Unless proactive measures based on solid evidence are implemented,
these threats will likely escalate and continue to endanger human well-being.
The escalating advancements in information and communication technologies have
facilitated the widespread availability and utilization of social media
platforms. Individuals utilize platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to
express their opinions, thoughts, and critiques on diverse subjects,
encompassing the pressing issue of climate change. The proliferation of climate
change-related content on social media necessitates comprehensive analysis to
glean meaningful insights. This paper employs natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to analyze climate change discourse and quantify the sentiment of
climate change-related tweets. We use ClimateBERT, a pretrained model
fine-tuned specifically for the climate change domain. The objective is to
discern the sentiment individuals express and uncover patterns in public
opinion concerning climate change. Analyzing tweet sentiments allows a deeper
comprehension of public perceptions, concerns, and emotions about this critical
global challenge. The findings from this experiment unearth valuable insights
into public sentiment and the entities associated with climate change
discourse. Policymakers, researchers, and organizations can leverage such
analyses to understand public perceptions, identify influential actors, and
devise informed strategies to address climate change challenges.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08099v2
Climate Change from Large Language Models,2023-12-19T09:26:46Z,"Hongyin Zhu, Prayag Tiwari","Climate change poses grave challenges, demanding widespread understanding and
low-carbon lifestyle awareness. Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful
tool to address this crisis, yet comprehensive evaluations of their
climate-crisis knowledge are lacking. This paper proposes an automated
evaluation framework to assess climate-crisis knowledge within LLMs. We adopt a
hybrid approach for data acquisition, combining data synthesis and manual
collection, to compile a diverse set of questions encompassing various aspects
of climate change. Utilizing prompt engineering based on the compiled
questions, we evaluate the model's knowledge by analyzing its generated
answers. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive set of metrics to assess
climate-crisis knowledge, encompassing indicators from 10 distinct
perspectives. These metrics provide a multifaceted evaluation, enabling a
nuanced understanding of the LLMs' climate crisis comprehension. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. In our
evaluation utilizing diverse high-performing LLMs, we discovered that while
LLMs possess considerable climate-related knowledge, there are shortcomings in
terms of timeliness, indicating a need for continuous updating and refinement
of their climate-related content.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11985v3
"Dimensional analysis identifies contrasting dynamics of past climate
  states and critical transitions",2023-09-22T08:05:59Z,"Tommaso Alberti, Fabio Florindo, Eelco J. Rohling, Valerio Lucarini, Davide Faranda","While one can unequivocally identify past climate transitions, we lack
comprehensive knowledge about their underlying mechanisms and timescales. Our
study employs a dimensional analysis of benthic stable isotope records to
uncover, across different timescales, how the climatic fluctuation of the
Cenozoic are associated with changes in the number of effective degrees of
freedom. Precession timescales dominate the Hothouse and Warmhouse states,
while the Icehouse climate is primarily influenced by obliquity and
eccentricity timescales. Notably, the Coolhouse state lacks dominant
timescales. Our analysis proves effective in objectively identifying abrupt
climate shifts and extremes. This is also demonstrated using high-resolution
data from the last glacial cycle, revealing abrupt climate shifts within a
single climate state. These findings significantly impact our understanding of
the inherent stability of each climate state and the evaluation of
(paleo-)climate models' ability to replicate key features of past/future
climate states and transitions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12693v1
"Dynamic Grouping for Climate Change Negotiation: Facilitating
  Cooperation and Balancing Interests through Effective Strategies",2023-07-26T01:12:44Z,"Duo Zhang, Yuren Pang, Yu Qin","The current framework for climate change negotiation models presents several
limitations that warrant further research and development. In this track, we
discuss mainly two key areas for improvement, focusing on the geographical
impacts and utility framework. In the aspects of geographical impacts, We
explore five critical aspects: (1) the shift from local to global impact, (2)
variability in climate change effects across regions, (3) heterogeneity in
geographical location and political structures, and (4) collaborations between
adjacent nations, (5) the importance of including historical and cultural
factors influencing climate negotiations. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to
refine the utility and rewards framework to reduce the homogeneity and the
level of overestimating the climate mitigation by integrating the positive
effects of saving rates into the reward function and heterogeneity among all
regions. By addressing these limitations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and
effectiveness of climate change negotiation models, enabling policymakers and
stakeholders to devise targeted and appropriate strategies to tackle climate
change at both regional and global levels.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13886v1
Understanding Opinions Towards Climate Change on Social Media,2023-12-02T20:02:34Z,"Yashaswi Pupneja, Joseph Zou, Sacha Lévy, Shenyang Huang","Social media platforms such as Twitter (now known as X) have revolutionized
how the public engage with important societal and political topics. Recently,
climate change discussions on social media became a catalyst for political
polarization and the spreading of misinformation. In this work, we aim to
understand how real world events influence the opinions of individuals towards
climate change related topics on social media. To this end, we extracted and
analyzed a dataset of 13.6 millions tweets sent by 3.6 million users from 2006
to 2019. Then, we construct a temporal graph from the user-user mentions
network and utilize the Louvain community detection algorithm to analyze the
changes in community structure around Conference of the Parties on Climate
Change~(COP) events. Next, we also apply tools from the Natural Language
Processing literature to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling on the
tweets. Our work acts as a first step towards understanding the evolution of
pro-climate change communities around COP events. Answering these questions
helps us understand how to raise people's awareness towards climate change thus
hopefully calling on more individuals to join the collaborative effort in
slowing down climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01217v1
