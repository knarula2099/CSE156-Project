Link Climate: An Interoperable Knowledge Graph Platform for Climate Data,2022-10-28T10:52:50Z,"Jiantao Wu, Fabrizio Orlandi, Declan O'Sullivan, Soumyabrata Dev","Climate science has become more ambitious in recent years as global awareness
about the environment has grown. To better understand climate, historical
climate (e.g. archived meteorological variables such as temperature, wind,
water, etc.) and climate-related data (e.g. geographical features and human
activities) are widely used by today's climate research to derive models for an
explainable climate change and its effects. However, such data sources are
often dispersed across a multitude of disconnected data silos on the Web.
Moreover, there is a lack of advanced climate data platforms to enable
multi-source heterogeneous climate data analysis, therefore, researchers must
face a stern challenge in collecting and analyzing multi-source data. In this
paper, we address this problem by proposing a climate knowledge graph for the
integration of multiple climate data and other data sources into one service,
leveraging Web technologies (e.g. HTTP) for multi-source climate data analysis.
The proposed knowledge graph is primarily composed of data from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's daily climate summaries,
OpenStreetMap, and Wikidata, and it supports joint data queries on these widely
used databases. This paper shows, with a use case in Ireland and the United
Kingdom, how climate researchers could benefit from this platform as it allows
them to easily integrate datasets from different domains and geographical
locations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16050v1
"How relevant is climate change research for climate change policy? An
  empirical analysis based on Overton data",2022-03-10T13:18:11Z,"Lutz Bornmann, Robin Haunschild, Kevin Boyack, Werner Marx, Jan C. Minx","Climate change is an ongoing topic in nearly all areas of society since many
years. A discussion of climate change without referring to scientific results
is not imaginable. This is especially the case for policies since action on the
macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society. In this
study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy
are connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was
released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.
The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be
reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we
suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in
Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on
policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents
around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point
out that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have
published more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that
climate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents
received significantly more citations on average than climate change papers
that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and
policy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth
sciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical
results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a
chain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment
reports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents
(policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government
reports to legislative documents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05358v1

Climate-Contingent Finance,2022-07-05T14:15:19Z,John Nay,"Climate adaptation could yield significant benefits. However, the uncertainty
of which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of
proactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by
benefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is
designed to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial
risk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the
level of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance
adaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for
entities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as
an investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of
return when they need it most.
  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they
over-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.
This is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in
climate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but
also outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic
value. This coordinates capital through time and place according to parties'
risk reduction capabilities and financial profiles, while also providing a
diversifying investment return.
  Climate-contingent finance can be generalized to any situation where entities
share exposure to a risk where they lack direct control over whether it occurs
(e.g., climate change, or a natural pandemic), and one type of entity can take
proactive actions to benefit from addressing the effects of the risk if it
occurs (e.g., through innovating on crops that would do well under extreme
climate change or vaccination technology that could address particular viruses)
with funding from another type of entity that seeks a targeted return to
ameliorate the downside.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02064v1
"Analysis of various climate change parameters in India using machine
  learning",2022-01-25T06:46:46Z,"Rutvij Wamanse, Tushuli Patil","Climate change in India is one of the most alarming problems faced by our
community. Due to adverse and sudden changes in climate in past few years,
mankind is at threat. Various impacts of climate change include extreme heat,
changing rainfall patterns, droughts, groundwater, glacier melt, sea-level
rise, and many more. Machine Learning can be used to analyze and predict the
graph of change using previous data and thus design a model which in the future
can furthermore be used to catalyze impactful work of climate change and take
steps in the direction to help India fight against the upcoming climate
changes. In this paper, we have analyzed 17 climate change parameters about
India. We have applied linear regression, exponential regression, and
polynomial regression to the parameters and evaluated the results. Using the
designed model, we will predict these parameters for the years 2025,2030, 2035.
These predicted values will thus help our community to prevent and take actions
against the adverse and hazardous effects on mankind. We have designed and
created this model which provides accurate results regarding all 17 parameters.
The predicted values will therefore help India to be well equipped against
climate change. This data when made available to the people of India will help
create awareness among them and will help us save our country from the
haphazard effects of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10123v1
"Revisiting the secondary climate attributes for transportation
  infrastructure management: A Redux and Update for 2020",2022-02-25T03:33:50Z,"Tao Liao, Paul Kepley, Indraneel Kumar, Samuel Labi","Environmental conditions in various regions can have a severely negative
impact on the longevity and durability of the civil engineering
infrastructures. In 2018, a published paper used 1971 to 2010 NOAA data from
the contiguous United States to examine the temporal changes in secondary
climate attributes (freeze-thaw cycles and freeze index) using the climate
normals from two time windows, 1971-2000 and 1981-2010. That paper investigated
whether there have been statistically significant changes in climate attribute
levels across the two time windows, and used GIS-based interpolation methods to
develop isarithmic maps of the climate attributes to facilitate their
interpretation and application. This paper updates that study. In this study,
we use NOAA climatic data from 1991 to 2020 to construct continuous surface
maps showing the values of the primary and secondary climate attributes at the
48 continental states. The new maps provide an updated picture of the freeze
index values and freeze-thaw cycles for the most recent climate condition.
These new values provide a better picture of the freezing season
characteristics of the United States, and will provide information necessary
for better winter maintenance procedures and infrastructure design to
accommodate regional climate differences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12480v1
Economic activity and climate change,2022-06-07T11:18:15Z,"Aránzazu de Juan, Pilar Poncela, Vladimir Rodríguez-Caballero, Esther Ruiz","In this paper, we survey recent econometric contributions to measure the
relationship between economic activity and climate change. Due to the critical
relevance of these effects for the well-being of future generations, there is
an explosion of publications devoted to measuring this relationship and its
main channels. The relation between economic activity and climate change is
complex with the possibility of causality running in both directions. Starting
from economic activity, the channels that relate economic activity and climate
change are energy consumption and the consequent pollution. Hence, we first
describe the main econometric contributions about the interactions between
economic activity and energy consumption, moving then to describing the
contributions on the interactions between economic activity and pollution.
Finally, we look at the main results on the relationship between climate change
and economic activity. An important consequence of climate change is the
increasing occurrence of extreme weather phenomena. Therefore, we also survey
contributions on the economic effects of catastrophic climate phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03187v2
"A Multi-task Model for Sentiment Aided Stance Detection of Climate
  Change Tweets",2022-11-07T13:19:44Z,"Apoorva Upadhyaya, Marco Fisichella, Wolfgang Nejdl","Climate change has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. Social
media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public
awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate
crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate
change through social media, the information could create more awareness and
reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter
communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies,
and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers.
In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on
Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two
attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of
Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes
toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely
related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change
tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection
(primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The
proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention
frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for
both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases
the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from
the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and
single-task variants.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03533v1

  and Combinations for Effective Implementation",2022-04-30T02:25:14Z,"Junze Zhang, Kerry Zhang, Mary Zhang, Jonathan H. Jiang, Philip E. Rosen, Kristen A. Fahy","Climate change is the long-term shift in global weather patterns, largely
caused by anthropogenic activity of greenhouse gas emissions. Global climate
temperatures have unmistakably risen and naturally occurring climate
variability alone cannot account for this trend. Human activities are estimated
to have caused about 1.0 degree C of global warming above the pre-industrial
baseline and if left unchecked, will continue to drastically damage the Earth
and its inhabitants. Globally, natural disasters and subsequent economic losses
have become increasingly impactful because of climate change. Both wildlife
ecosystems and human habitats have been negatively impacted, from rising sea
levels to alarming frequency of severe weather events around the world.
Attempts towards alleviating the effects of global warming have often been at
odds and remain divided among a multitude of strategies, reducing the overall
effectiveness of these efforts. It is evident that collaborative action is
required for avoiding the most severe consequences of climate change. This
paper evaluates the main strategies (industrial/energy, political, economic,
agricultural, atmospheric, geological, coastal, and social) towards both
mitigating and adapting to climate change. As well, it provides an optimal
combination of seven solutions which can be implemented simultaneously, working
in tandem to limit and otherwise accommodate the harmful effects of climate

locations across the world. Contaminated sites often require decades to
remediate or to monitor natural attenuation. Climate change exacerbates the
long-term site management problem because extreme precipitation and/or shifts
in precipitation/evapotranspiration regimes could re-mobilize contaminants and
proliferate affected groundwater. To quickly assess the spatiotemporal
variations of groundwater contamination under uncertain climate disturbances,
we developed a physics-informed machine learning surrogate model using U-Net
enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) to solve Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs) of groundwater flow and transport simulations at the site
scale.We develop a combined loss function that includes both data-driven
factors and physical boundary constraints at multiple spatiotemporal scales.
Our U-FNOs can reliably predict the spatiotemporal variations of groundwater
flow and contaminant transport properties from 1954 to 2100 with realistic
climate projections. In parallel, we develop a convolutional autoencoder
combined with online clustering to reduce the dimensionality of the vast
historical and projected climate data by quantifying climatic region
similarities across the United States. The ML-based unique climate clusters
provide climate projections for the surrogate modeling and help return reliable
future recharge rate projections immediately without querying large climate
datasets. In all, this Multi-scale Digital Twin work can advance the field of

"Minimax-Regret Climate Policy with Deep Uncertainty in Climate Modeling
  and Intergenerational Discounting",2022-01-21T18:21:21Z,"Stephen J. DeCanio, Charles F. Manski, Alan H. Sanstad","Integrated assessment models have become the primary tools for comparing
climate policies that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Policy
comparisons have often been performed by considering a planner who seeks to
make optimal trade-offs between the costs of carbon abatement and the economic
damages from climate change. The planning problem has been formalized as one of
optimal control, the objective being to minimize the total costs of abatement
and damages over a time horizon. Studying climate policy as a control problem
presumes that a planner knows enough to make optimization feasible, but
physical and economic uncertainties abound. Earlier, Manski, Sanstad, and
DeCanio proposed and studied use of the minimax-regret (MMR) decision criterion
to account for deep uncertainty in climate modeling. Here we study choice of
climate policy that minimizes maximum regret with deep uncertainty regarding
both the correct climate model and the appropriate time discount rate to use in
intergenerational assessment of policy consequences. The analysis specifies a
range of discount rates to express both empirical and normative uncertainty
about the appropriate rate. The findings regarding climate policy are novel and
informative. The MMR analysis points to use of a relatively low discount rate
of 0.02 for climate policy. The MMR decision rule keeps the maximum future
temperature increase below 2C above the 1900-10 level for most of the parameter
values used to weight costs and damages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08826v1

around this contested issue. Facebook is a dominant social media platform known
to be a major source of information and online influence, yet discussion of
climate change on the platform has remained largely unstudied due to
difficulties in accessing data. This paper utilises Facebook's repository of
social/political ads to study how climate change is framed as an issue in
adverts placed by different actors. Sponsored content is a strategic investment
and presumably intended to be persuasive, so patterns of who pays for adverts
and how those adverts frame the issue can reveal large-scale trends in public
discourse. We show that most money spent on climate-related messaging is
targeted at users in the US, GB and CA. While the number of advert impressions
correlates with total spend by an actor, there is a secondary effect of unpaid
social sharing which can substantially affect the number of impressions per
dollar spent. Most spend in the US is by political actors, while environmental
non-governmental organisations dominate spend in GB. Analysis shows that
climate change solutions are well represented in GB, while climate change
impacts such as extreme weather events are strongly represented in the US and
CA. Different actor types frame the issue of climate change in different ways;
political actors position the issue as party political and a point of
difference between candidates, whereas environmental NGOs frame climate change
as the focus of collective action and social mobilisation. Overall, our study
provides a first empirical exploration of climate-related advertising on
Facebook. It shows the diversity of actors seeking to use Facebook as a

shows that adding semi-supervised novelty detection to identify out-of-sample

sharply improves the quality of predictions. We design an augmented climate
model with a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) novelty detector that
provides better temperature and precipitation forecasts in a year-long

  Ecosystem Extinction via Phase-tipping",2022-10-06T10:16:26Z,"Hassan Alkhayuon, Jessa Marley, Sebastian Wieczorek, Rebecca C. Tyson","Human activity is leading to changes in the mean and variability of climatic
parameters in most locations around the world. The changing mean has received
considerable attention from scientists and climate policy makers. However,
recent work indicates that the changing variability, that is, the amplitude and
the temporal autocorrelation of deviations from the mean, may have greater and
more imminent impact on ecosystems.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that changes in climate variability alone could
drive cyclic predator-prey ecosystems to extinction via so-called phase tipping
(P-tipping), a new type of instability that occurs only from certain phases of
the predator-prey cycle. We construct a mathematical model of a variable
climate and couple it to two self-oscillating paradigmatic predator-prey
models. Most importantly, we combine realistic parameter values for the Canada
lynx and snowshoe hare with actual climate data from the boreal forest. In this
way, we demonstrate that critically important species in the boreal forest have
increased likelihood of P-tipping to extinction under predicted changes in
climate variability, and are most vulnerable during stages of the cycle when
the predator population is near its maximum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals
that stochastic resonance is the underlying mechanism for the increased

machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performing
architectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, we
benchmark popular AutoML libraries on three high-leverage CCAI applications:
climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find that
out-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass the
performance of human-designed CCAI models. However, we also identify a few key
weaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailored
to computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of search
spaces have been designed for image and language data, none have been designed
for spatiotemporal data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to the
discovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gains

occurrence of natural disasters in the real-world scenario. Besides the study
of causes and preconditions of such calamities, post-disaster analysis is
essential for the efficient management of the disaster situation. This process
needs timely and accurate data in light of the increasing frequency and
severity of climate change-related extreme weather events. The analysis of
disaster data involves the challenging task of integrating multiple
heterogeneous sources, data ingestion and visualization. This paper aims at
providing a three-dimensional analytical view of disaster data as time-series
charts and a statistical model to evaluate the correlation between the
occurrence of disasters, climate change and the corresponding economic damages
(as a percentage of GDP). Therefore, statistical methodologies are leveraged to
play important role in managing disasters, from preparation to recovery and
reporting. The graphical representations provide insights on regional trends
that follow, related to factors such as the proportion of each type of disaster

the population, the economy and climate are crucial both for risk management
and preparedness and for responding to disasters. The research puts forth a
detailed statistical methodology with a spatial dimension to study the impacts
on the economy and infrastructure in the aftermath of a disaster thereby
ensuring specialized assistance. The inference of the analysis confirmed a
positive correlation between climate change and occurrence of natural
disasters. Therefore, statistical evidence of an important phenomenon like

"Precipitation efficiency amplifies climate sensitivity by enhancing
  tropical circulation slowdown and eastern pacific warming",2022-07-13T13:32:15Z,"Ryan Li, Joshua Studholme, Alexey Fedorov, Trude Storelvmo","Cloud processes are the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying the
global temperature response to carbon dioxide rise. Still, the role of
precipitation efficiency (PE) -- surface rain per unit column -- integrated
condensation -- is yet to be quantified. Here we use 36 limited-domain cloud
resolving simulations from the Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Model
Intercomparison Project to show that they strongly imply climate warming will
result in increases to net precipitation efficiency. We then analyze 35 General
Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
6 and find that increasing PE enhances tropical circulation slowdown and
strengthens eastern equatorial Pacific warming. These changes trigger
pan-tropical positive cloud feedback by causing stratiform anvil cloud
reduction and stratocumulus suppression, and thereby amplify overall climate
sensitivity. Quantitatively, we find that in the 24 of 35 GCMs which match the
cloud-resolving models in simulating increasing PE with greenhouse warming,
mean Effective Climate Sensitivity is 1 K higher than in GCMs in which PE
decreases. The models simulating increasing PE also comprise all estimates of
effective climate sensitivity over 4 K. Taken together, these results show that
further constraining PE sensitivity to warming will reduce uncertainty over
future climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06188v1

the result of $\gtrsim$10 K global cooling, from global average surface

considered. The residuals from the prediction achieve either uncorrelatedness
or mean independence with the exogenous variables, thus guaranteeing
robustness. We define D&A as a unified hypothesis testing framework that relies
on the same statistical model but uses different targets and test statistics.
In the experiments, we first show that the CO2 forcing can be robustly
predicted from temperature spatial patterns under strong interventions on the
solar forcing. Second, we illustrate attribution to the greenhouse gases and
aerosols while protecting against interventions on the aerosols and CO2
forcing, respectively. Our study shows that incorporating robustness
constraints against relevant interventions may significantly benefit detection

This study introduces a new machine-learning based framework relying on
satellite observations to improve understanding of the representation of clouds
and their relevant processes in climate models. The proposed method is capable
of assigning distributions of established cloud types to coarse data. It
facilitates a more objective evaluation of clouds in ESMs and improves the
consistency of cloud process analysis. The method is built on satellite data
from the MODIS instrument labelled by deep neural networks with cloud types
defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), using cloud type labels
from CloudSat as ground truth. The method is applicable to datasets with
information about physical cloud variables comparable to MODIS satellite data
and at sufficiently high temporal resolution. We apply the method to
alternative satellite data from the Cloud\_cci project (ESA Climate Change
Initiative), coarse-grained to typical resolutions of climate models. The
resulting cloud type distributions are physically consistent and the horizontal
resolutions typical of ESMs are sufficient to apply our method. We recommend
outputting crucial variables required by our method for future ESM data
evaluation. This will enable the use of labelled satellite data for a more

cooperation on climate change mitigation with n strategic agents poses a
complex game-theoretic problem. For example, agents may negotiate and reach
climate agreements, but there is no central authority to enforce adherence to
those agreements. Hence, it is critical to design negotiation and agreement
frameworks that foster cooperation, allow all agents to meet their individual
policy objectives, and incentivize long-term adherence. This is an
interdisciplinary challenge that calls for collaboration between researchers in

"A Model of Mass Extinction Accounting for Species's Differential
  Evolutionary Response to a Catastrophic Climate Change",2022-08-26T17:28:01Z,"Amer Alsulami, Sergei Petrovskii","Mass extinction is a phenomenon in the history of life on Earth when a
considerable number of species go extinct over a relatively short period of
time. The magnitude of extinction varies between the events, the most well
known are the ``Big Five'' when more than one half of all species got extinct.
There were many extinctions with a smaller magnitude too. It is widely believed
that the common trigger leading to a mass extinction is a climate change such a
global warming or global cooling. There are, however, many open questions with
regard to the effect and potential importance of specific factors and
processes. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model that takes into
account two factors largely overlooked in the mass extinctions literature,
namely, (i) the active feedback of phytoplankton to the climate through
changing the albedo of the ocean surface and (ii) the species's adaptive
evolutionary response to a climate change. We show that whether species goes
extinct or not depends on a subtle interplay between the scale of the climate
change and the rate of the evolutionary response. We also show that species's
response to a fast climate change can exhibit long transient dynamics (false
extinction) when the species population density remain at a low value for a
long time before recovering to its safe steady state value. Finally, we show
that the distribution of extinction frequencies predicted by our model is
generally consistent with the fossil record.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12792v1

An Interpretable Model of Climate Change Using Correlative Learning,2022-12-05T21:52:19Z,"Charles Anderson, Jason Stock","Determining changes in global temperature and precipitation that may indicate
climate change is complicated by annual variations. One approach for finding

impacts than localized events as they can lead to widespread flooding. It is
debated how climate change may affect the spatial extent of precipitation
extremes, whose investigation often directly relies on simulations from climate
models. Here, we use a different strategy to investigate how future changes in
spatial extents of precipitation extremes differ across climate zones and
seasons in two river basins (Danube and Mississippi). We rely on observed
precipitation extremes while exploiting a physics-based mean temperature
covariate, which enables us to project future precipitation extents. We include
the covariate into newly developed time-varying $r$-Pareto processes using a
suitably chosen spatial aggregation functional $r$. This model captures
temporal non-stationarity in the spatial dependence structure of precipitation
extremes by linking it to the temperature covariate, which we derive from
observations for model calibration and from debiased climate simulations
(CMIP6) for projections. For both river basins, our results show negative

decrease in spatial precipitation extent in a warming climate during rain
seasons as precipitation intensity increases locally.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03028v1

Surrogate Ensemble Forecasting for Dynamic Climate Impact Models,2022-04-12T13:30:01Z,"Julian Kuehnert, Deborah McGlynn, Sekou L. Remy, Aisha Walcott-Bryant, Anne Jones","As acute climate change impacts weather and climate variability, there is
increased demand for robust climate impact model predictions from which
forecasts of the impacts can be derived. The quality of those predictions are
limited by the climate drivers for the impact models which are nonlinear and
highly variable in nature. One way to estimate the uncertainty of the model
drivers is to assess the distribution of ensembles of climate forecasts. To
capture the uncertainty in the impact model outputs associated with the
distribution of the input climate forecasts, each individual forecast ensemble
member has to be propagated through the physical model which can imply high
computational costs. It is therefore desirable to train a surrogate model which
allows predictions of the uncertainties of the output distribution in ensembles
of climate drivers, thus reducing resource demands. This study considers a
climate driven disease model, the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), which predicts
the malaria transmission coefficient R0. Seasonal ensembles forecasts of
temperature and precipitation with a 6-month horizon are propagated through the
model, predicting the distribution of transmission time series. The input and
output data is used to train surrogate models in the form of a Random Forest
Quantile Regression (RFQR) model and a Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)

the time series of the individual ensemble member, while the BLSTM offers a

model performance in wind speed and direction and to project their future
changes under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario over inland
and offshore locations across the Continental United States. The proposed
conditional approach extends the scope of existing studies by characterizing
the changes of the full range of the joint wind speed and direction
distribution. Directional wind speed distributions are estimated using two
statistical methods: a Weibull distributional regression model and a quantile
regression model, both of which enforce the circular constraint to their
resulting estimates of directional distributions. Projected uncertainties
associated with different climate models and model internal variability are
investigated and compared with the climate change signal to quantify the
statistical significance of the future projections. In particular this work
extends the concept of internal variability to the standard deviation and high
quantiles to assess the relative magnitudes to their projected changes. The
evaluation results show that the studied climate model capture both historical
wind speed, wind direction, and their dependencies reasonably well over both
inland and offshore locations. In the future, most of the locations show no
significant changes in mean wind speeds in both winter and summer, although the
changes in standard deviation and 95th-quantile show some robust changes over
certain locations in winter. The proposed conditional approach enables the
characterization of the directional wind speed distributions, which offers

predictions, and the improvement strongly depends on the ensembling scheme. In
this work, we propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN) ensembling method, which
combines climate models within a Bayesian model averaging framework, to improve
the predictive capability of model ensembles. Our proposed BNN approach
calculates spatiotemporally varying model weights and biases by leveraging
individual models' simulation skill, calibrates the ensemble prediction against
observations by considering observation data uncertainty, and quantifies
epistemic uncertainty when extrapolating to new conditions. More importantly,
the BNN method provides interpretability about which climate model contributes
more to the ensemble prediction at which locations and times. Thus, beyond its
predictive capability, the method also brings insights and understanding of the
models to guide further model and data development. In this study, we apply the
BNN weighting scheme to an ensemble of CMIP6 climate models for monthly
precipitation prediction over the conterminous United States. In both synthetic
and real case studies, we demonstrate that BNN produces predictions of monthly
precipitation with higher accuracy than three baseline ensembling methods. BNN
can correctly assign a larger weight to the regions and seasons where the
individual model fits the observation better. Moreover, its offered
interpretability is consistent with our understanding of localized climate
model performance. Additionally, BNN shows an increasing uncertainty when the
prediction is farther away from the period with constrained data, which
appropriately reflects our predictive confidence and trustworthiness of the
models in the changing climate.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04390v1

distribution of the insolation. Here, we introduce the Non-hydrostatic
ICosahedral Atmospheric Model(NICAM), a global cloud-resolving model, to
investigate the climate of high-obliquity planets. This model can explicitly
simulate a three-dimensional cloud distribution and vertical transports of
water vapor. We simulated exo-terrestrial climates with high resolution using
the supercomputer FUGAKU. We assumed aqua-planet configurations with 1 bar of

general circulation model for exoplanetary science) with parametrization for
cloud formation, and 2) high-resolution (~ 14 km-mesh) with an explicit cloud
microphysics scheme. Results suggest that high-resolution simulations with an
explicit treatment of cloud microphysics reveal warmer climates due to less low

unclear. We investigate this question by deploying a global atmospheric, coarse
resolution model known as SPEEDY to simulate a changing climate system subject
to increased $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations, over a 100 year timescale. Whilst
double precision is typically the operational standard for climate modelling,
we find that reduced precision solutions (Float32, Float16) are sufficiently
accurate. Rounding the finite precision floats stochastically, rather than
using the more common ``round-to-nearest"" technique, notably improves the
performance of the reduced precision solutions. Over 100 years the mean bias
error (MBE) in the global mean surface temperature (precipitation) relative to
the double precision solution is $+2 \times 10^{-4}$K ($-8 \times 10^{-5}$
mm/6hr) at single precision and $-3.5\times 10^{-2}$ K($-1 \times 10^{-2}$

the half precision error to +1.8 $\times 10^{-2}$ K ($-8 \times10^{-4}$

years, the difference in the expected value of the global surface temperature,
relative to the double precision solution is $\leq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ K and for

dynamic game. Second, we study both cooperative and non-cooperative solutions
to this RICE dynamic game. In cooperative settings, we investigate the global
social welfare equilibrium that maximizes the weighted and cumulative social
welfare across regions. We next divide the regions into two clusters: developed
and developing, and look at the social welfare frontier under the notion of
Pareto optimality. We also present a receding horizon approach to approximate
the global social welfare equilibrium for robustness and computational
efficiency. For non-cooperative settings, we study best-response dynamics and
open-loop Nash equilibrium of the RICE game. A Recursive Best-response

best-response decisions for dynamic games, which indicates convergence to
open-loop Nash equilibrium when applied to the RICE game by numerical studies.

assessment. Here we show, using a traditional Koppen-Geiger bioclimate
classification system, that the latest CMIP6 Earth System Models actually agree
very well on the fraction of the global land-surface that will undergo a
significant change per degree of global warming. Data from historical and
ssp585 model runs are used to create bioclimate maps at various degrees of
global warming, and to investigate the performance of the ensemble mean when
classifying climate data into discrete categories. Using a streamlined scheme
with 13 classifications, global bioclimate classification maps at 2K and 4K of
global warming above a 1901-1931 reference period are presented. These
projections show large shifts in bioclimate distribution, with an almost
exclusive change from colder, wetter bioclimates to hotter, dryer ones.
Historical model run performance is assessed and examined by comparison with
the bioclimatic classifications derived from the observed climate over the same
time period. The fraction of the land experiencing a change in its bioclimatic
class as a function of global warming is estimated by combining the results
from the individual models. Despite the discrete nature of the bioclimatic
classification scheme, we find only a weakly-saturating dependence of this
fraction on global warming which implies about 12 pct of land experiencing a
significant change in climate, per 1K increase in global mean temperature
between the global warming levels of 1 and 3K. Therefore, we estimate that
stabilising the climate at 1.5K rather than 2K of global warming, would save

  Sensitivity",2022-10-21T20:55:40Z,"Haozhe He, Ryan J. Kramer, Brian J. Soden, Nadir Jeevanjee","When evaluating the effect of CO2 changes on the earth's climate, it is
widely assumed that instantaneous radiative forcing from a doubling of a given
CO2 concentration (IRF2xCO2) is constant and that variances in climate
sensitivity arise from differences in radiative feedbacks, or a dependence of
these feedbacks on the climatological base-state. In this paper, we show that
the IRF2xCO2 is not constant, but also depends on the climatological
base-state, increasing by ~25% for every doubling of CO2, and has increased by
~10% since the pre-industrial era primarily due to stratospheric cooling,
implying a proportionate increase in climate sensitivity. This base-state
dependence also explains about half of the inter-model spread in IRF2xCO2, a
problem that has persisted among climate models for nearly three decades.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12244v1

overfit the data, and the resulting parameters are taken as a compact
representation of the original grid-based data. While compression ratios range
from 300x to more than 3,000x, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art

important large scale atmosphere structures and does not introduce artifacts.
When using the resulting neural network as a 790x compressed dataloader to
train the WeatherBench forecasting model, its RMSE increases by less than 2%.
The three orders of magnitude compression democratizes access to

Climate Change Policy Exploration using Reinforcement Learning,2022-10-23T18:20:17Z,Theodore Wolf,"Climate Change is an incredibly complicated problem that humanity faces. When
many variables interact with each other, it can be difficult for humans to
grasp the causes and effects of the very large-scale problem of climate change.
The climate is a dynamical system, where small changes can have considerable

this system in the right ways could help us find creative solutions to climate
change.
  In this research, we combine Deep Reinforcement Learning and a World-Earth
system model to find, and explain, creative strategies to a sustainable future.
This is an extension of the work from Strnad et al. where we extend on the

Reinforcement Learning agents varying in complexity to probe the environment in
different ways and to find various strategies. The environment is a
low-complexity World Earth system model where the goal is to reach a future
where all the energy for the economy is produced by renewables by enacting
different policies. We use a reward function based on planetary boundaries that
we modify to force the agents to find a wider range of strategies. To favour

Evidence of Amazon rainforest dieback in CMIP6 models,2022-03-22T14:00:11Z,"Isobel Parry, Paul Ritchie, Peter Cox","Amazon forest dieback is seen as a potential tipping point under climate
change. These concerns are partly based-on an early coupled climate-carbon

Amazonia. In contrast, the 5th generation Earth System Models (CMIP5) produced
few examples of Amazon dieback under climate change. Here we examine results
from seven 6th generation models (CMIP6) which include vegetation dynamics, and
in some cases interactive forest fires. Although these models typically project
increases in area-mean forest carbon across Amazonia under CO2-induced climate
change, five of the seven models also produce abrupt reductions in vegetation
carbon which indicate localised dieback events. The Northern South America
region (NSA), which contains most of the rainforest, is especially vulnerable
in the models. These dieback events, some of which are mediated by fire, are
preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in near surface
temperature, which is consistent with more extreme dry seasons. Based-on the

Most sites either already host telescopes that provide in situ measurements of
weather parameters or are candidates for hosting next-generation telescopes.
For a fine representation of orography, we use the highest resolution global
climate model (GCM) ensemble available provided by the high-resolution model
intercomparison project and developed as part of the European Union Horizon
2020 PRIMAVERA project. We evaluate atmosphere-only and coupled PRIMAVERA GCM
historical simulations against in situ measurements and the fifth generation
atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) of the ECMWF. The projections of changes in
current site conditions are then analysed for the period 2015-2050 using
PRIMAVERA future climate simulations. Over most sites, we find that PRIMAVERA
GCMs show good agreement in temperature, specific humidity, and precipitable
water vapour compared to in situ observations and ERA5. The ability of
PRIMAVERA to simulate those variables increases confidence in their
projections. For those variables, the model ensemble projects an increasing
trend for all sites. On the other hand, no significant trends are projected for
relative humidity, cloud cover, or astronomical seeing and PRIMAVERA does not

at the global scale a methodological framework for filling this specific gap.
We analyse over 13 000 earth-observed quarterly temperature, precipitation and
river flow time series. We adopt the Koppen-Geiger climate classification
system and define continental-scale geographical regions for conducting upon
them seasonal hydroclimatic feature summaries. The analyses rely on three

entropy feature, a Hurst feature, a trend strength feature and a seasonality
strength feature. We find notable differences to characterize the magnitudes of
these features across the various Koppen-Geiger climate classes, as well as
between continental-scale geographical regions. We, therefore, deem that the
consideration of the comparative summaries could be beneficial in water
resources engineering contexts. Lastly, we apply explainable machine learning
to compare the investigated features with respect to how informative they are
in distinguishing either the main Koppen-Geiger climates or the
continental-scale regions. In this regard, the sample autocorrelation, temporal

Climate Response and Sensitivity: Timescales and Late Tipping Points,2022-07-13T10:33:42Z,"Robbin Bastiaansen, Peter Ashwin, Anna S. von der Heydt","Climate response metrics are used to quantify the Earth's climate response to
anthropogenic changes of atmospheric CO2. Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS)
is one such metric that measures the equilibrium response to CO2 doubling.
However, both in their estimation and their usage, such metrics make
assumptions on the linearity of climate response, although it is known that,
especially for larger forcing levels, response can be nonlinear. Such nonlinear
responses may become visible immediately in response to a larger perturbation,
or may only become apparent after a long transient. In this paper, we
illustrate some potential problems and caveats when estimating ECS from
transient simulations. We highlight ways that very slow timescales may lead to
poor estimation of ECS even if there is seemingly good fit to linear response
over moderate timescales. Moreover, such slow timescale might lead to late
abrupt responses (""late tipping points"") associated with a system's
nonlinearities. We illustrate these ideas using simulations on a global energy
balance model with dynamic albedo. We also discuss the implications for
estimating ECS for global climate models, highlighting that it is likely to
remain difficult to make definitive statements about the simulation times

How far can we trust climate change predictions?,2022-04-25T12:46:55Z,Francois Louchet,"Current techniques for predicting climate change are mainly based on
""massive"" deterministic numerical modeling. However, the ocean-atmosphere

large sensitivity to initial conditions, the approach of a possible tipping
over a critical point cannot be evidenced ""by construction"" using numerical
modeling, due to the divergence of computation time in the vicinity of the
tipping point. On the other hand, the increasing amplitudes of observed
climatic instabilities seem to be an obvious sign of the approach of such a
tipping point, easily interpreted as a ""critical softening"", well known in the
theory of dynamical systems, that would bring us irreversibly into a new and
totally unexplored equilibrium state, except for a significantly higher
temperature and in a much closer time than expected from numerical modeling

using historical precipitation and temperature data and water levels collected
in monitoring wells, first investigates the possible correlations between
meteorological and groundwater indices at each well. Then, if there is a
correlation, a linear regression analysis is used to model the relationships
between SGIs and SPIs, and SGIs and SPEIs. The same relationships are used to
infer future SGIs from SPI and SPEI projections obtained by means of an
ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs), under different climate scenarios
(RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). This methodology has been applied to data collected in
Tuscany (Italy), where historical series of daily climate variables (since

indicates that, in the historical period and for most of the monitoring wells,
there is a good correlation between SGIs and SPIs or SPEIs. In a global warming
scenario, the influence of temperature on evapotranspiration phenomena cannot
be overlooked so the SGI-SPEI relationships seem more suitable to forecast
groundwater droughts. According to these relationships, negative effects on
groundwater levels in almost all wells are estimated for the futureDue to the
type of data required and its simplicity, this methodology can be applied to
different areas of interest for a quick estimate of groundwater availability

projected temperatures universally increase extinction risk. These results show
that population changes under future climate conditions may be more extensive

Teleconnections among Tipping Elements in the Earth System,2022-09-09T14:36:31Z,"Teng Liu, Dean Chen, Lan Yang, Jun Meng, Zanchenling Wang, Josef Ludescher, Jingfang Fan, Saini Yang, Deliang Chen, Jürgen Kurths, Xiaosong Chen, Shlomo Havlin, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber","Tipping elements of the Earth system may shift abruptly and irreversibly from
one state to another at tipping points, resulting in a growing threat to our
society. Yet, it is not fully clear how to assess and quantify the influence of
a tipping element and how to explore the teleconnections between different
tipping elements. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a climate network
approach to quantitatively analyze the global impacts of a prominent tipping
element, the Amazon Rainforest Area (ARA). We find that regions, such as, the
Tibetan Plateau (TP) and West Antarctic ice sheet, are characterized by higher
network weighted links and exhibit strong correlations with the ARA. We then
identify a teleconnection propagation path between the ARA and the TP. This
path is robust under climate change as simulated by various climate models of
CMIP5 and CMIP6. In addition, we detect early warning signals for critical
transition in the snow cover extent on the Tibetan Plateau by applying critical
slowing down indicators, lag-1 autocorrelation and detrended fluctuation
analysis. We find that the snow cover of the TP has been losing stability since
2008, revealing that the TP is operating like a tipping element and approaching
a potential tipping point. We further uncover that various climate extremes
between the ARA and the TP are significantly synchronized under climate change.
Our framework provides new insights into how tipping elements are linked to
each other and into the potential predictability of cascading tipping dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04327v1

  Insight from the world's largest scaled freshwater fish",2022-02-10T16:49:22Z,"Nicolas Dubos, Maxime Lenormand, Leandro Castello, Thierry Oberdorff, Antoine Guisan, Sandra Luque","The Amazon floodplains represent important surfaces of highly valuable
ecosystems, yet they remain neglected from protected areas. While the
efficiency of the protected area network of the Amazon basin may be jeopardised
by climate change, floodplains are exposed to important consequences of climate
change but are omitted from species distribution models and protection gap
analyses. We modelled the current and future (2070) distribution of the giant
bony-tongue fish Arapaima sp. accounting for climate and habitat requirements,
with consideration of dam presence (already existing and planned constructions)
and hydroperiod (high- and low-water stages). We further quantified the amount
of suitable environment which falls inside and outside the current network of
protected areas to identify spatial conservation gaps. We predict climate
change to cause the decline of environmental suitability by 16.6% during the
high-water stage, and by 19.4% during the low-water stage. We found that about
70% of the suitable environments of Arapaima sp. remain currently unprotected,
which is likely to increase by 5% with future climate change effects. Both
current and projected dam constructions may hamper population flows between the
central and the Bolivian and Peruvian parts of the basin. We highlight
protection gaps mostly in the southwestern part of the basin and recommend the
extension of the current network of protected areas in the floodplains of the
upper Ucayali, Juru\`a and Purus Rivers and their tributaries. This study
showed the importance of taking into account hydroperiods and dispersal
barriers in forecasting the distribution of freshwater fish species, and

spatial pattern, tempo, and cause of drying are poorly constrained. We built a
globally-distributed database of constraints on Mars late-stage paleolake size

zonation as Mars was drying out. Aridity increased over time in southern
midlatitude highlands, where lakes became proportionally as small as in modern
Nevada. Meanwhile, intermittently wetter climates persisted in equatorial and
northern-midlatitude lowlands. This is consistent with a change in Mars'
greenhouse effect that left highlands too cold for liquid water except during a
brief melt season, or alternatively with a fall in Mars' groundwater table. The
data are consistent with a switch of unknown cause in the dependence of aridity

A meta-analysis of the total economic impact of climate change,2022-07-25T13:39:24Z,Richard S. J. Tol,"Earlier meta-analyses of the economic impact of climate change are updated

economic impact of global warming is always negative. (2) The confidence
interval about the estimates is much wider. (3) Elicitation methods are most
pessimistic, econometric studies most optimistic. Two previous results remain:
(4) The uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises. (5)
Poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones. A meta-analysis of
the impact of weather shocks reveals that studies, which relate economic growth
to temperature levels, cannot agree on the sign of the impact whereas studies,
which make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the
sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. The former studies posit
that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that
the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of
the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a

  distributions",2022-11-08T23:23:14Z,"Fabrizio Falasca, Andrew Brettin, Laure Zanna, Stephen M. Griffies, Jianjun Yin, Ming Zhao","Studies agree on a significant global mean sea level rise in the 20th century
and its recent 21st century acceleration in the satellite record. At regional
scale, the evolution of sea level probability distributions is often assumed to
be dominated by changes in the mean. However, a quantification of changes in
distributional shapes in a changing climate is currently missing. To this end,
we propose a novel framework quantifying significant changes in probability
distributions from time series data. The framework first quantifies linear
trends in quantiles through quantile regression. Quantile slopes are then
projected onto a set of four $orthogonal$ polynomials quantifying how such
changes can be explained by $independent$ shifts in the first four statistical
moments. The framework proposed is theoretically founded, general and can be
applied to any climate observable with close-to-linear changes in
distributions. We focus on observations and a coupled climate model (GFDL-CM4).
In the historical period, trends in coastal daily sea level have been driven
mainly by changes in the mean and can therefore be explained by a shift of the
distribution with no change in shape. In the modeled world, robust changes in
higher order moments emerge with increasing CO2 concentration. Such changes are
driven in part by ocean circulation alone and get amplified by sea level
pressure fluctuations, with possible consequences for sea level extremes

but in this context so far hardly considered technology -- can contribute to
overcome climate-related challenges. We categorise potential computer audition
applications according to the five elements of earth, water, air, fire, and
aether, proposed by the ancient Greeks in their five element theory; this
categorisation serves as a framework to discuss computer audition in relation
to different ecological aspects. Earth and water are concerned with the early
detection of environmental changes and, thus, with the protection of humans and
animals, as well as the monitoring of land and aquatic organisms. Aerial audio
is used to monitor and obtain information about bird and insect populations.
Furthermore, acoustic measures can deliver relevant information for the
monitoring and forecasting of weather and other meteorological phenomena. The
fourth considered element is fire. Due to the burning of fossil fuels, the
resulting increase in CO$_2$ emissions and the associated rise in temperature,
fire is used as a symbol for man-made climate change and in this context
includes the monitoring of noise pollution, machines, as well as the early
detection of wildfires. In all these areas, computer audition can help

response that mitigates the effects of climate change and (c) whether there is
a threshold of defoliation which could be used as an early warning sign for

The distribution of aggregate storm risk in a changing climate,2022-11-15T11:19:02Z,Toby P Jones,"The financial losses from extreme weather events can have a disastrous
effect, often costing billions of pounds. While changes in the disposition of
individual events is of importance to both the insurance and re-insurance
industries, these companies are often concerned with the aggregate risk posed
in a season. This project explores how the statistical properties of aggregate
risk measures may change when, to reflect the earth's changing climate, models
are made time dependent. Historical random sum equations by Wald (1945) and
Blackwell and Girshick (1947) are used to develop a relationship between the
frequency of events and the aggregate risk.
  The covariance between the occurrence of events and aggregate risk is found
to be the product of the expected value of the aggregate risk and the
dispersion statistic. Furthermore, a new equation (the ""J-equation"") relates
the correlation between the frequency of events and aggregate risk to the shape
of the distribution of storm intensities and the dispersion statistic. This
equation highlights that the correlation between the two variables is invariant
to a change in the scale of the severity distribution. The theory is applied to
a simulated future dataset from the 2020 Norwegian climate model NorESM2-LM. As
the data observes the theory presented, this opens the door for these results
to be applied to wider geographical regions in future studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08058v1

alterations in synoptic circulations. Here, the automated Jenkinson-Collison
(JC) classification is used to assess the ability of twenty-one Global Climate
Models (GCMs) to capture the frequency of recurring circulation types (CTs) and
their implications for European daily precipitation intensities in summer
(JJA). The ability of the GCMs to reproduce the observed present-day climate
features is first evaluated. Most GCMs capture the observed links between mean
directional flow characteristics of the CTs, and the occurrence of dry days and
related dry months. The most robust relationships are found for anticyclonic
and easterly CTs which are generally associated with higher than average
occurrences of dry conditions. Future changes in summer frequencies of the CTs
are estimated in the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario for the sake of a high
signal-to-noise ratio. Our results reveal consistent changes, mainly in the
zonal CTs. A robust decrease in frequency of the westerlies and increase in the
frequency of easterly CTs favour more continental, dry and warm air masses over
Central Europe. These dynamical changes are shown to enhance the projected

under two conditions: (i) the null simulation of the climate model is
independent of the physical observations and (ii) the null simulation provides
consistent estimation of the residual covariance matrix of the physical
observations, both depend on the conduction and the quality of the climate
models. If the latter condition fails, the estimator would be still unbiased
and consistent under routine conditions, but losing the ""optimal"" aspect of the

detection and attribution require the estimation of the forced signal as well
as the internal variability covariance matrix in order to distinguish between
their influences in the observational record. While previously developed
approaches have taken into account the uncertainty linked to the estimation of
the forced signal, there has been less focus on uncertainty in the covariance
matrix describing natural variability, despite the fact that the specification
of this covariance matrix is known to meaningfully impact the results. Here we
propose a Bayesian optimal fingerprinting framework using a Laplacian basis
function parameterization of the covariance matrix. This parameterization,
unlike traditional methods based on principal components, does not require the
basis vectors themselves to be estimated from climate model data, which allows
for the uncertainty in estimating the covariance structure to be propagated to
the optimal fingerprinting regression parameter. We show through a CMIP6
validation study that this proposed approach achieves better-calibrated
coverage rates of the true regression parameter than principal component-based
approaches. When applied to HadCRUT observational data, the proposed approach
detects anthropogenic warming with higher confidence levels, and with lower

Emergence of universal scaling in weather extreme events,2022-09-06T08:40:46Z,"Qing Yao, Jingfang Fan, Jun Meng, Valerio Lucarini, Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen, Kim Christensen, Xiaosong Chen","The frequency and magnitude of weather extreme events have increased
significantly during the past few years in response to anthropogenic climate
change. However, global statistical characteristics and underlying physical
mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we adopt a statistical physics
and probability theory based method to investigate the nature of extreme
weather events, particularly the statistics of the day-to-day air temperature
differences. These statistical measurements reveal that the distributions of
the magnitudes of the extreme events satisfy a universal \textit{Gumbel}
distribution, while the waiting time of those extreme events is governed by a
universal \textit{Gamma} function. Further finite-size effects analysis
indicates robust scaling behaviours. We additionally unveil that the cumulative
distribution of logarithmic waiting times between the record events follows an
\textit{Exponential} distribution and that the evolution of this climate system
is directional where the underlying dynamics are related to a decelerating
release of tension. The universal scaling laws are remarkably stable and
unaffected by global warming. Counterintuitively, unlike as expected for record
dynamics, we find that the number of quakes of the extreme temperature
variability does not decay as one over time but with deviations relevant to
large-scale climate extreme events. Our theoretical framework provides a fresh

cooling during the late Archean could then have favored the triggering of the

State-of-the-art Earth system models can provide detailed insight into these

cheap machine learning models for the task of climate model emulation. In this
manuscript, we explore the efficacy of randomly wired neural networks for this

Furthermore, out of 24 different model architecture, parameter count, and

changes in its distribution under non-stationary climate conditions is key to
mitigating the impact of flooding events. We propose a non-stationary process
mixture model (NPMM) for annual streamflow maxima over the central US (CUS)
which uses downscaled climate model precipitation projections to forecast
extremal streamflow. Spatial dependence for the model is specified as a convex
combination of transformed Gaussian and max-stable processes, indexed by a
weight parameter which identifies the asymptotic regime of the process. The
weight parameter is modeled as a function of the annual precipitation for each
of the two hydrologic regions within the CUS, introducing spatio-temporal
non-stationarity within the model. The NPMM is flexible with desirable tail
dependence properties, but yields an intractable likelihood. To address this,
we embed a neural network within a density regression model which is used to
learn a synthetic likelihood function using simulations from the NPMM with
different parameter settings. Our model is fitted using observational data for
1972--2021, and inference carried out in a Bayesian framework. The two regions
within the CUS are estimated to be in different asymptotic regimes based on the
posterior distribution of the weight parameter. Annual streamflow maxima

scenarios suggest an overall increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme

transport, which saw significant decreases in usage during the pandemic, and

investigate mode preferences for commuting trips in different working from home

be convinced that their travel choices can have an effect on climate change and
the spread of infectious diseases. The discrete choice experiment showed that
the use of cars for commuting is relatively consistent regardless of the

turbulence above the summit. Under a changing climate, however, we ask how the

in-situ meteorological observations, radiosonde profiles, and numerical
reanalyses to construct a climatology at Maunakea over the previous 40 years.
We are interested in both the meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed and
humidity), and the image quality (e.g., seeing). We find that meteorological
conditions were, in general, relatively stable over the period with few
statistically significant trends and with quasi-cyclical inter-annual
variability in astronomically significant parameters such as temperature and
precipitable water vapour. We do, however, find that maximum wind speeds have
increased over the past decades, with the frequency of wind speeds above
15~m~s$^{-1}$ increasing in frequency by 1--2%, which may have a significant
impact on ground-layer turbulence. Importantly, we find that the Fried

three prominent hydropower plants of India using MICE of EC-Earth3 and MME from
CMIP6. We estimate the streamflow projections for all ensembles using the
Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model for four time periods,
historical, near, mid and far-term. We estimate maximum hydropower production
generated using monthly release and hydraulic head available at the reservoir.
We also analyzed the role of bias correction in hydropower production. The
results show that ICV plays a significant role in estimating streamflow and
hydropower estimation for monsoon and throughout the year, respectively. Model
uncertainty contributes more to total uncertainty than ICV in estimating the
streamflow and potential hydropower. However, ICV is increasing towards the
far-term. We also show that bias correction does not preserve the internal

This approach is applied to data from the fully coupled climate model AWI-ESM.
It enables us to investigate how extremes will change depending on the
geographic location not only in terms of the magnitude, but also in terms of
the timing of the changes. We observe that in general, changes in extremes are
stronger and more rapid over land masses than over oceans. In addition, our
models differentiate between changes in mean, in variability and in
distributional shape, allowing for developments in these statistics to take
place independently and at different times. Different models are presented and
the Bayesian Information Criterion is used for model selection. It turns out
that in most regions, changes in mean and variance take place simultaneously

predictive skills, with respect to random climatological forecasts, for the
occurrence of long-lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of
time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and also
at much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture). This

A framework for model-assisted T x E x M exploration in maize,2022-06-06T04:53:10Z,"Jennifer Hsiao, Soo-Hyung Kim, Dennis J. Timlin, Nathaniel D. Mueller, Abigail L. S. Swann","Breeding for new crop characteristics and adjusting management practices are
critical avenues to mitigate yield loss and maintain yield stability under a
changing climate. However, identifying high-performing plant traits and
management options for different growing regions through traditional breeding
practices and agronomic field trials is often time and resource-intensive.
Mechanistic crop simulation models can serve as powerful tools to help
synthesize cropping information, set breeding targets, and develop adaptation
strategies to sustain food production. In this study, we develop a modeling
framework for a mechanistic crop model (MAIZSIM) to run many simulations within

Relative Sea Level and Abrupt Mass Unloading,2022-07-06T16:22:31Z,Julien Gargani,"Relative sea level records climatic change as well as vertical land movement.
In Barbados, uplift variation is necessary to interpret one of the most
complete coral reef records. Here we show that an abrupt mass unloading of 30
km3 caused an uplift variation of ~0.45 mm/yr using a modelling approach.
Simulations have been conducted for different volumes and elastic thicknesses.
Isostatic adjustment in relation with an abrupt mass unloading explains the
observed uplift rate increased from 0.34 mm/yr to 0.8 mm/yr that occurred 11.2
kyr ago. The reconstructed sea-level curve highlights a sea-level jump of 4.8
m, with a delay of 150 yr from the termination of Younger Dryas cold event and
300 yr before the abrupt mass unloading. This sea-level jump corresponds to
meltwater pulse MWP-1B and is not an artefact. A stagnation of 500 yr occurred
from 12 to 11.5 kyr BP. Relative sea level records are useful to detect past
landslides and erosion. Accurate analysis and reconstruction of sea-level
permits to determine sea-level abrupt rise caused by climate warming during the

Significance of a one-degree Celsius increase in global temperature,2022-07-11T14:57:12Z,Jean-Sebastien Gagnon,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports indicate that the
global mean temperature is about one-degree Celsius higher than pre-industrial
levels, that this increase is anthropogenic, and that there is a causal
relationship between this higher temperature and an increase in frequency and
magnitude of extreme weather events. This causal relationship seems at odds
with common sense, and may be difficult to explain to non-experts. Thus to
appreciate the significance of a one-degree increase in global mean
temperature, we perform back-of-the-envelope calculations relying on simple
physics. We estimate the excess thermal energy trapped in the climate system
(oceans, land, atmosphere) from a one-degree Celsius increase in global mean
temperature, and show that it is thousands of times larger than the estimated
energy required to form and maintain a hurricane. Our estimates show that
global warming is forming a very large pool of excess energy that could in
principle power heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and hurricanes. The
arguments presented here are sufficiently simple to be presented in
introductory physics classes, and can serve as plausibility arguments showing
that even a seemingly small increase in global mean temperature can potentially
lead to extreme weather events.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04920v1
Correlations Between COVID-19 and Dengue,2022-07-27T14:55:28Z,"Paula Bergero, Laura P. Schaposnik, Grace Wang","A dramatic increase in the number of outbreaks of Dengue has recently been

social behaviour or climate variables), to develop predictive models that could
improve our knowledge and provide useful tools for health policy makers.
Through the use of neural networks with different social and natural

that the number of cases of COVID-19 and Dengue have very similar trends. We

spatio-temporal neural network. The model predicts the Palmer Drought Severity
Index (PDSI) for subregions of interest. Predictions by climate models provide
an additional source of knowledge of the model leading to more accurate drought

  Profiles",2022-10-20T21:54:16Z,"Mary Lai Salvana, Mikyoung Jun","Variables contained within the global oceans can detect and reveal the
effects of the warming climate as the oceans absorb huge amounts of solar

variables is critical for climate monitoring. In this paper, we investigate the
spatial correlation structure between ocean temperature and salinity using data
harvested from the Argo program and construct a model to capture their
bivariate spatial dependence from the surface to the ocean's interior. We
develop a flexible class of multivariate nonstationary covariance models
defined in 3-dimensional (3D) space (longitude x latitude x depth) that allows
for the variances and correlation to change along the vertical pressure
dimension. These models are able to describe the joint spatial distribution of
the two variables while incorporating the underlying vertical structure of the
ocean. We demonstrate that proposed cross-covariance models describe the
complex vertical cross-covariance structure well, while existing

considering the whole spectrum of time scales, the results of the analysis
suggest that temperature drives CO2 concentration, or that are both driven by
the common astronomical forcing. However, considering only millennial-scale

to larger, brighter, longer-lasting clouds that reflect more sunlight and cool
the Earth. The strength of the effect is however heterogeneous, meaning it
depends on the surrounding environment, making ACI one of the most uncertain
effects in our current climate models. In our work, we use causal machine
learning to estimate ACI from satellite observations by reframing the problem
as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius). We predict the

nuclear war, climate change, asteroid impacts, artificial intelligence and
pandemics, which are the most harmful disasters in terms of their extent of
destruction on the length of human survival. We consider the starting point of
the predicted average number of survival years as the present calendar year.
Nuclear war, when sampling from an artificial normal distribution, results in
an average human survival time of 60 years into the future starting from the

an average human survival time of 193 years, the simulation based on impact
from asteroids results in an average of 1754 years. Since the risks from
asteroid impacts could be considered to reside mostly in the far future, it can
be concluded that nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics are presently the

change issues and forest preservation, a large demand for carbon offsetting,
carbon footprint ratings, and environmental impact assessments is emerging.
Most often, deforestation maps are created from optical data such as Landsat

due to persistent cloud cover in many parts of the world, especially the
tropics where most of the world's forest biomass is concentrated. Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) can fill this gap as it penetrates clouds. We propose and
evaluate a novel method for deforestation detection in the absence of reliable

accuracy is maintained when adding up to 20% noise to the reference labels.

The effect of ambiguity in strategic environments: an experiment,2022-09-22T15:09:35Z,"Pablo Brañas-Garza, Antonio Cabrales, María Paz Espinosa, Diego Jorrat","We experimentally study a game in which success requires a sufficient total
contribution by members of a group. There are significant uncertainties
surrounding the chance and the total effort required for success. A theoretical
model with max-min preferences towards ambiguity predicts higher contributions
under ambiguity than under risk. However, in a large representative sample of
the Spanish population (1,500 participants) we find that the ATE of ambiguity
on contributions is zero. The main significant interaction with the personal
characteristics of the participants is with risk attitudes, and it increases
contributions. This suggests that policymakers concerned with ambiguous
problems (like climate change) do not need to worry excessively about
ambiguity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11079v1

meadows play a critical role in regulating and understanding Earth's changing

  flow prediction in Intelligent Transportation Systems",2022-03-21T06:38:34Z,"Wei Zhao, Shiqi Zhang, Bing Zhou, Bei Wang","Air pollution and carbon emissions caused by modern transportation are
closely related to global climate change. With the help of next-generation
information technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI), accurate traffic flow prediction can effectively solve
problems such as traffic congestion and mitigate environmental pollution and
climate change. It further promotes the development of Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) and smart cities. However, the strong spatial and
temporal correlation of traffic data makes the task of accurate traffic
forecasting a significant challenge. Existing methods are usually based on
graph neural networks using predefined spatial adjacency graphs of traffic
networks to model spatial dependencies, ignoring the dynamic correlation of
relationships between road nodes. In addition, they usually use independent
Spatio-temporal components to capture Spatio-temporal dependencies and do not
effectively model global Spatio-temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a
new Spatio-temporal Causal Graph Attention Network (STCGAT) for traffic
prediction to address the above challenges. In STCGAT, we use a node embedding
approach that can adaptively generate spatial adjacency subgraphs at each time
step without a priori geographic knowledge and fine-grained modeling of the
topology of dynamically generated graphs for different time steps. Meanwhile,
we propose an efficient causal temporal correlation component that contains
node adaptive learning, graph convolution, and local and global causal temporal
convolution modules to learn local and global Spatio-temporal dependencies

A high-resolution canopy height model of the Earth,2022-04-13T10:34:32Z,"Nico Lang, Walter Jetz, Konrad Schindler, Jan Dirk Wegner","The worldwide variation in vegetation height is fundamental to the global
carbon cycle and central to the functioning of ecosystems and their
biodiversity. Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information
is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change, and
prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall
canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single
data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI
deliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical
satellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot
directly measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have
developed a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from
Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these
estimates. The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly
encountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to
resolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map,
only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data
play an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these
tall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent,
uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to
detect change and inform decision making. The approach can serve ongoing
efforts in forest conservation, and has the potential to foster advances in
climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08322v1

  obliquity from 58 to 48 Myr ago due to solar system chaos",2022-07-08T16:49:01Z,Richard E. Zeebe,"The dynamical evolution of the solar system is chaotic with a Lyapunov time
of only $\sim$5 Myr for the inner planets. Due to the chaos it is fundamentally
impossible to accurately predict the solar system's orbital evolution beyond
$\sim$50 Myr based on present astronomical observations. We have recently
developed a method to overcome the problem by using the geologic record to
constrain astronomical solutions in the past. Our resulting optimal
astronomical solution (called ZB18a) shows exceptional agreement with the
geologic record to $\sim$58 Ma (Myr ago) and a characteristic resonance
transition around 50 Ma. Here we show that ZB18a and integration of Earth's and
Mars' spin vector based on ZB18a yield reduced variations in Earth's and Mars'
orbital inclination and Earth's obliquity (axial tilt) from $\sim$58 to
$\sim$48 Ma -- the latter being consistent with paleoclimate records. The
changes in the obliquities have important implications for the climate
histories of Earth and Mars. We provide a detailed analysis of solar system
frequencies ($g$- and $s$-modes) and show that the shifts in the variation in
Earth's and Mars' orbital inclination and obliquity around 48 Ma are associated
with the resonance transition and caused by changes in the contributions to the
superposition of $s$-modes, plus $g$-$s$-mode interactions in the inner solar
system. The $g$-$s$-mode interactions and the resonance transition (consistent
with geologic data) are unequivocal manifestations of chaos. Dynamical chaos in
the solar system hence not only affects its orbital properties, but also the
long-term evolution of planetary climate through eccentricity and the link
between inclination and axial tilt.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04006v1

conditions that modulate complex ecological processes taking place at several
timescales. Interactions between vegetation and different environmental drivers

an emerging spatial context at landscape and regional scales. We formulate the
land surface forecasting task as a strongly guided video prediction task where
the objective is to forecast the vegetation developing at very fine resolution

how ConvLSTM models can not only forecast the seasonal evolution of NDVI at
high resolution, but also the differential impacts of weather anomalies over
the baselines. The model is able to predict different vegetation types, even

"Elastic Functional Changepoint Detection of Climate Impacts from
  Localized Sources",2022-11-23T03:50:48Z,"J. Derek Tucker, Drew Yarger","Detecting changepoints in functional data has become an important problem as
interest in monitoring of climate phenomenon has increased, where the data is
functional in nature. The observed data often contains both amplitude
($y$-axis) and phase ($x$-axis) variability. If not accounted for properly,
true changepoints may be undetected, and the estimated underlying mean change
functions will be incorrect. In this paper, an elastic functional changepoint
method is developed which properly accounts for these types of variability. The
method can detect amplitude and phase changepoints which current methods in the
literature do not, as they focus solely on the amplitude changepoint. This
method can easily be implemented using the functions directly or can be
computed via functional principal component analysis to ease the computational
burden. We apply the method and its non-elastic competitors to both simulated
data and observed data to show its efficiency in handling data with phase
variation with both amplitude and phase changepoints. We use the method to
evaluate potential changes in stratospheric temperature due to the eruption of
Mt.\ Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991. Using an epidemic changepoint

destruction within countries that encompass the Mediterranean Basin. Recent
worrying trends in wildfire activity (i.e., occurrence and spread) suggest that
wildfires are likely to be highly impacted by climate change. In order to
facilitate appropriate risk mitigation, we must identify the main drivers of
extreme wildfires and assess their spatio-temporal trends, with a view to
understanding the impacts of global warming on fire activity. We analyse the
monthly burnt area due to wildfires over a region encompassing most of Europe
and the Mediterranean Basin from 2001 to 2020, and identify high fire activity
during this period in Algeria, Italy and Portugal. We build an extreme quantile
regression model with a high-dimensional predictor set describing
meteorological conditions, land cover usage, and orography. To model the

vapour-pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature, and drought on wildfire
activity. Our results highlight that whilst VPD, air temperature, and drought
significantly affect wildfire occurrence, only VPD affects wildfire spread. To
gain insights into the effect of climate trends on wildfires in the near
future, we focus on August 2001 and perturb temperature according to its
observed trends (median over Europe: +0.04K per year). We find that, on average

to future environmental change and to manage these responses. To make such

accurately characterize how organisms experience their environments and the
biological mechanisms by which they respond. All organisms are
thermodynamically connected to their environments through the exchange of heat
and water at fine spatial and temporal scales and this exchange can be captured
with biophysical models. Although mechanistic models based on biophysical
ecology have a long history of development and application, their use in global
change biology remains limited despite their enormous promise and increasingly
accessible software. We contend that greater understanding and training in the
theory and methods of biophysical models is vital to expand their application.
Our review shows how biophysical models can be implemented to understand and
predict climate change impacts on species' behavior, phenology, survival,
distribution, and abundance. We illustrate the types of outputs that can be
generated, and the data inputs required for different implementations. Examples
range from simple calculations of body temperature to more complex analyses of
species' distribution limits based on projected energy and water balances,
accounting for behavior and phenology. We outline challenges that currently
limit the widespread application of biophysical models. We discuss progress and
future developments that could allow these models to be applied to many species

so its height determines the nature of processes in the atmosphere and depends
on them. The criterion for determining the height of the tropopause is a
decrease in the vertical temperature gradient in a layer above 5 km and at
least 2 km thick. Consequently, the uncertainty in determining the height of
the section between the troposphere and the stratosphere is 2 km or more. In
addition, the temperature profile changes due to the influence of many reasons,
so sometimes the height of the tropopause cannot even be determined. The
optical properties of air in the troposphere and stratosphere differ, which
makes it possible to measure the height of the section with high accuracy using
a radiosonde with an optical sensor. The launches of radiosondes with optical
sensors made it possible to measure the height of the tropopause by changing
the attenuation coefficient of visible light. It turned out that the lower edge
of the tropopause corresponds to a sharp change in the attenuation coefficient.
The repeatability of the results was confirmed by the simultaneous launch of

that although the magnitude of CAPE change in high-resolution model output is
only slightly underestimated with simple theories, it is insufficient to
describe the distributional changes, which has a down-sloping structure and is
crucial for impact assessment. A more appropriate framework for understanding
CAPE changes uses the tight correlation between CAPE and moist static energy
(MSE) surplus. Atmospheric profiles develop appreciable CAPE only when MSE
surplus becomes positive; beyond this point, CAPE increases as $\sim$25% of the
rise in MSE surplus. Because this relationship is robust across climate states,
changes in future CAPE distributions can be well-captured by a simple scaling

generate cloud clusters that capture meaningful distinctions among cloud

optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework for the vertical
disaggregation of AOD into extinction profiles, i.e. the measure of light

self-consistent simulations of meteorological covariates, AOD and extinction
profiles. Our results show that, while very simple, our model is able to
reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty,
outperforming by an order of magnitude the idealized baseline which is
typically used in satellite AOD retrieval algorithms. In particular, the model
demonstrates a faithful reconstruction of extinction patterns arising from
aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. Observations however suggest that
other extinction patterns, due to aerosol mass concentration, particle size and
radiative properties, might be more challenging to capture and require
additional vertically resolved predictors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04296v2
"Explaining the physics of transfer learning a data-driven subgrid-scale
  closure to a different turbulent flow",2022-06-07T11:42:29Z,"Adam Subel, Yifei Guan, Ashesh Chattopadhyay, Pedram Hassanzadeh","Transfer learning (TL) is becoming a powerful tool in scientific applications
of neural networks (NNs), such as weather/climate prediction and turbulence
modeling. TL enables out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., extrapolation in
parameters) and effective blending of disparate training sets (e.g.,
simulations and observations). In TL, selected layers of a NN, already trained
for a base system, are re-trained using a small dataset from a target system.
For effective TL, we need to know 1) what are the best layers to re-train? and
2) what physics are learned during TL? Here, we present novel analyses and a
new framework to address (1)-(2) for a broad range of multi-scale, nonlinear
systems. Our approach combines spectral analyses of the systems' data with
spectral analyses of convolutional NN's activations and kernels, explaining the
inner-workings of TL in terms of the system's nonlinear physics. Using
subgrid-scale modeling of several setups of 2D turbulence as test cases, we
show that the learned kernels are combinations of low-, band-, and high-pass
filters, and that TL learns new filters whose nature is consistent with the
spectral differences of base and target systems. We also find the shallowest
layers are the best to re-train in these cases, which is against the common
wisdom guiding TL in machine learning literature. Our framework identifies the
best layer(s) to re-train beforehand, based on physics and NN theory. Together,
these analyses explain the physics learned in TL and provide a framework to
guide TL for wide-ranging applications in science and engineering, such as
climate change modeling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03198v1
"Effects of Varying Land Coverage, Rotation Period, and Water Vapor on
  Equatorial Climates that Bridge the Gap between Earth-like and Titan-like",2022-07-12T20:22:18Z,"Matthew McKinney, J. Mitchell, S. I. Thomson","Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has an Earth-like volatile cycle, but with
methane playing the role of water and surface liquid reservoirs geographically
isolated at high latitudes. We recreate Titan's characteristic dry hydroclimate
at the equator of an Earth-like climate model without seasons and with water as
the condensable by varying a small set of planetary parameters. We use three
observationally motivated criteria for Titan-like conditions at the equator: 1)
the peak in surface specific humidity is not at the equator, despite it having
the warmest annual-mean temperatures; 2) the vertical profile of specific
humidity in the equatorial column is nearly constant through the lower
troposphere; and 3) the relative humidity near the surface at the equator is
significantly lower than saturation (lower than 60%). We find that simply
reducing the available water at the equator does not fully reproduce Titan-like
conditions. We additionally vary the rotation period and volatility of water to
mimic Titan's slower rotation and more abundant methane vapor. Longer rotation
periods coupled with a dry equatorial surface meet fewer of the Titan-like
criteria than equivalent experiments with shorter rotation periods. Experiments
with higher volatility of water meet more criteria than those with lower
volatility, with some of those with the highest volatility meeting all three,
demonstrating that an Earth-like planet can display Titan-like climatology by
changing only a few physical parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05815v1
"Towards Generating Large Synthetic Phytoplankton Datasets for Efficient
  Monitoring of Harmful Algal Blooms",2022-08-03T20:15:55Z,"Nitpreet Bamra, Vikram Voleti, Alexander Wong, Jason Deglint","Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of harmful algal
blooms (HABs), which cause significant fish deaths in aquaculture farms. This
contributes to ocean pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since dead
fish are either dumped into the ocean or taken to landfills, which in turn
negatively impacts the climate. Currently, the standard method to enumerate
harmful algae and other phytoplankton is to manually observe and count them
under a microscope. This is a time-consuming, tedious and error-prone process,
resulting in compromised management decisions by farmers. Hence, automating
this process for quick and accurate HAB monitoring is extremely helpful.
However, this requires large and diverse datasets of phytoplankton images, and
such datasets are hard to produce quickly. In this work, we explore the
feasibility of generating novel high-resolution photorealistic synthetic
phytoplankton images, containing multiple species in the same image, given a
small dataset of real images. To this end, we employ Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images. We evaluate three different GAN
architectures: ProjectedGAN, FastGAN, and StyleGANv2 using standard image
quality metrics. We empirically show the generation of high-fidelity synthetic
phytoplankton images using a training dataset of only 961 real images. Thus,
this work demonstrates the ability of GANs to create large synthetic datasets
of phytoplankton from small training datasets, accomplishing a key step towards
sustainable systematic monitoring of harmful algal blooms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02332v1

  Consumption in New York City",2022-08-05T07:14:21Z,"Thomas Dougherty, Rishee Jain","The reduction of greenhouse gases from buildings forms the cornerstone of
policy to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, the automation of
urban scale building energy modeling systems required to meet global urban
demand has proven challenging due to the bespoke characteristics of each city.
One such point of uniqueness between cities is that of urban microclimate,
which may play a major role in altering the performance of energy efficiency in
buildings. This research proposes a way to rapidly collect urban microclimate
data through the utilization of satellite readings and climate reanalysis. We
then demonstrate the potential utility of this data by composing an analysis
against three years of monthly building energy consumption data from New York
City. As a whole, microclimate in New York City may be responsible for large
swings in urban energy consumption. We estimate that Central Park may reduce
the electricity consumption of adjacent buildings by 5-10%, while vegetation
overall seems to have no appreciable impact on gas consumption. We find that
favorable urban microclimates may decrease the gas consumption of some
buildings in New York by 71% while others may increase gas consumption by as
much as 221%. Additionally, microclimates may be responsible for the decrease
of electricity consumption by 28.6% in regions or increases of 77% consumption
in others. This work provides a method of curating global, high resolution
microclimate data, allowing researchers to explore the invisible walls of urban
microclimate which interact with the buildings around them.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03017v1
Boundary constraints on the large-scale ocean circulation,2022-08-24T20:38:26Z,Tomas Jonathan,"The Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) is a system of surface and deep
currents encompassing all ocean basins, crucial to the Earth's climate.
Detecting potential climatic changes in the MOC first requires a careful
characterisation of its inherent variability. Key components of the MOC are the
Atlantic MOC (AMOC) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The role of
boundary properties in determining the AMOC and ACC is investigated, as a
function of cross-sectional coordinate and depth, using a hierarchy of general
circulation models. The AMOC is decomposed as the sum of near-surface Ekman,
depth-independent bottom velocity and eastern and western boundary density
components. The decomposition proves a useful low-dimensional characterisation
of the full 3-D overturning circulation. The estimated total basin-wide AMOC
overturning streamfunction, reconstructed using only boundary information, is
in good agreement with direct calculations of the overturning using meridional
velocities. The time-mean maximum overturning streamfunction is relatively
constant with latitude, despite its underlying boundary contributions varying
considerably, especially in the northern hemisphere. Applying a similar
decomposition diagnostic to the ACC provides insight into the differences
between model simulations, revealing spatial resolution dependence of ACC
transport through the Drake Passage. All models exhibit a weak ACC compared to
observations. Density maps along sloping ocean boundaries are produced,
incorporating the western and eastern Atlantic boundaries and the Antarctic
coastline. Isopycnals are flat over long portions of eastern ocean boundaries,
and slope linearly on western boundaries. Results of this thesis serve to
indicate the importance of boundary information in characterising the AMOC and
the ACC, and the relative simplicity of along-sloping-boundary density
structure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11766v1
Decarbonizing OCP,2022-09-13T23:00:01Z,"Dimitris Bertsimas, Ryan Cory-Wright, Vassilis Digalakis Jr","We present our collaboration with the OCP Group, one of the world's largest
producers of phosphate and phosphate-based products, to reduce OCP's carbon
emissions significantly. We study the problem of decarbonizing OCP's
electricity supply by installing a mixture of solar panels and batteries to
minimize its time-discounted investment cost plus the cost of satisfying its
remaining demand via the national grid. OCP is currently designing its
renewable investment strategy, using insights gleaned from our optimization
model, and has pledged to invest 130 billion MAD (approx. 13 billion USD) in a
green initiative by 2027, a subset of which involves decarbonization. We
immunize our model against deviations between forecast and realized solar
generation output via a combination of robust and distributionally robust
optimization. To account for variability in daily solar generation, we propose
a data-driven robust optimization approach that prevents excessive conservatism
by averaging across uncertainty sets. To protect against variability in
seasonal weather patterns induced by climate change, we invoke distributionally
robust optimization techniques. Under a 10 billion MAD investment by OCP, the
proposed methodology reduces the carbon emissions which arise from OCP's energy
needs by more than 70% while generating a net present value (NPV) of 5 billion
MAD over twenty years. Moreover, a 20 billion MAD investment induces a 95%
reduction in carbon emissions and generates an NPV of around 2 billion MAD. To
fulfill the Paris climate agreement, rapidly decarbonizing the global economy
in a financially sustainable fashion is imperative. Accordingly, this work
develops a robust optimization methodology that enables OCP to decarbonize at a
profit by purchasing solar panels and batteries. Moreover, the methodology
could be applied to decarbonize other industrial consumers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06341v2

Long-term hail risk assessment with deep neural networks,2022-08-31T18:24:39Z,"Ivan Lukyanenko, Mikhail Mozikov, Yury Maximov, Ilya Makarov","Hail risk assessment is necessary to estimate and reduce damage to crops,
orchards, and infrastructure. Also, it helps to estimate and reduce consequent
losses for businesses and, particularly, insurance companies. But hail
forecasting is challenging. Data used for designing models for this purpose are
tree-dimensional geospatial time series. Hail is a very local event with
respect to the resolution of available datasets. Also, hail events are rare -
only 1% of targets in observations are marked as ""hail"". Models for nowcasting
and short-term hail forecasts are improving. Introducing machine learning
models to the meteorology field is not new. There are also various climate
models reflecting possible scenarios of climate change in the future. But there
are no machine learning models for data-driven forecasting of changes in hail
frequency for a given area.
  The first possible approach for the latter task is to ignore spatial and
temporal structure and develop a model capable of classifying a given vertical
profile of meteorological variables as favorable to hail formation or not.
Although such an approach certainly neglects important information, it is very
light weighted and easily scalable because it treats observations as
independent from each other. The more advanced approach is to design a neural
network capable to process geospatial data. Our idea here is to combine
convolutional layers responsible for the processing of spatial data with
recurrent neural network blocks capable to work with temporal structure.

An analysis of degradation in low-cost particulate matter sensors,2022-10-26T14:41:31Z,"Priyanka deSouza, Karoline Barkjohn, Andrea Clements, Jenny Lee, Ralph Kahn, Ben Crawford, Patrick Kinney","Low-cost sensors (LCS) are increasingly being used to measure fine
particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in cities around the world. One of
the most commonly deployed LCS is the PurpleAir with about 15,000 sensors
deployed in the United States. However, the change in sensor performance over
time has not been well studied. It is important to understand the lifespan of
these sensors to determine when they should be replaced, and when measurements
from these devices should or should not be used for various applications. This
paper fills in this gap by leveraging the fact that: 1) Each PurpleAir sensor
is comprised of two identical sensors and the divergence between their
measurements can be observed, and 2) There are numerous PurpleAir sensors
within 50 meters of regulatory monitors allowing for the comparison of
measurements between these two instruments. We propose empirically-derived
degradation outcomes for the PurpleAir sensors and evaluate how these outcomes
change over time. On average, we find that the number of 'flagged'
measurements, where the two sensors within each PurpleAir disagree, increases
in time to 4 percent after 4 years of operation. Approximately, 2 percent of
all PurpleAir sensors were permanently degraded. The largest fraction of
permanently degraded PurpleAir sensors appeared to be in the hot and humid
climate zone, suggesting that the sensors in this zone may need to be replaced
sooner. We also find that the bias of PurpleAir sensors, or the difference
between corrected PM2.5 levels and the corresponding reference measurements,
changed over time by -0.12 ug/m3 (95% CI: -0.13 ug/m3, -0.11 ug/m3) per year.

method's output to a set of hypotheses drawn from the literature and by
inspecting the ""belief landscape"" generated by the method. My analysis
indicates that the method is relatively robust to different parameter settings,
and results suggest that 1) there are many stable configurations of belief, or
attractors, on the polarizing issue of climate change and 2) that people move
in predictable ways around these attractors. The method paves the way for more
powerful tools that can be used to understand how the modern digital media

energies to meet the ever-stringent climate target. Hydrogen, as an energy
carrier, will play a key role in building a climate-neutral society. Although
liquid hydrogen is essential for hydrogen storage and transportation,
liquefying hydrogen is costly with the conventional methods based on
Joule-Thomas effect. As an emerging technology which is potentially more
efficient, magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction is a ""game-changer"". In this
work, we have investigated the rare-earth-based Laves phases ${\rm R}Al_2$ and
${\rm R}Ni_2$ for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. We have noticed an
unaddressed feature that the magnetocaloric effect of second-order
magnetocaloric materials can become ""giant"" near the hydrogen boiling point.
This feature indicates strong correlations, down to the boiling point of
hydrogen, among the three important quantities of the magnetocaloric effect:
the maximum magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$, the maximum adiabatic
temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$, and the Curie temperature $T_C$. Via
a comprehensive literature review, we interpret the correlations for a
rare-earth intermetallic series as two trends: (1) $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$
increases with decreasing $T_C$; (2) $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$ decreases near room
temperature with decreasing $T_C$ but increases at cryogenic temperatures.
Moreover, we have developed a mean-field approach to describe these two trends
theoretically. The dependence of $\Delta S_{m}^{max}$ and $\Delta T_{ad}^{max}$
on $T_C$ revealed in this work helps us quickly anticipate the magnetocaloric
performance of rare-earth-based compounds, guiding material design and
accelerating the discoveries of magnetocaloric materials for hydrogen

"Modelling the effect of aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing on the South
  and East Asian monsoons with an intermediate complexity climate model",2022-11-16T20:58:18Z,"Lucy Recchia, Valerio Lucarini","The South and East Asian summer monsoons are globally significant
meteorological features, creating a strongly seasonal pattern of precipitation.
The stability of the monsoon is of extreme importance for a vast range of
ecosystems and for the livelihoods of a large share of the world's population.
Simulations are performed with an intermediate complexity climate model,
PLASIM, to assess the future response of the monsoons to changing
concentrations of aerosols and greenhouse gases. The aerosol loading consists
of a mid-tropospheric warming and a surface cooling, which is applied to India,
Southeast Asia and East China, both concurrently and independently. The primary
effect of increased aerosol loading is a decrease in summer precipitation in
the vicinity of the applied forcing, although the regional response varies
significantly. The decrease in precipitation is only partially ascribable to a
decrease in the precipitable water, and instead derives from a reduction of the
precipitation efficiency, due to changes in the stratification of the
atmosphere. When the aerosol loading is added in all regions simultaneously,
precipitation in East China is most strongly affected, with a quite distinct
transition to a low precipitation regime as the radiative forcing increases
beyond 60 W/m^2. The response is less abrupt as we move westward, with
precipitation in South India being least affected. This lower sensitivity in
South India is attributed to aerosol forcing over East China. Additionally, the
effect on precipitation is approximately linear with the forcing. The impact of
doubling carbon dioxide levels is to increase precipitation over the regions
and weaken the circulation. When the carbon dioxide and aerosol forcings are
applied at the same time, the carbon dioxide forcing partially offsets the
surface cooling and reduction in precipitation associated with the aerosol
response.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09212v2
"A novel approach to exploit elastic deformation to constrain regional
  ice mass change in Antarctica",2022-12-12T02:47:38Z,"William Durkin, Terry Wilson, Michael Bevis","Across the ANET GNSS network, decadal mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet
drives elastic uplift rates of up to 20 mm/yr. We explore, for the first time,
the viability of using elastic deformation observed in the ANET GNSS network to
constrain ice mass changes in Antarctica. We begin by estimating which regions
of ice mass loss contribute to the elastic deformation observed at each ANET
GNSS site. This is done using an observer-centric model of elastic deformation,
which we call a Load Sensitivity Kernel (LSK). Using this approach, we find
that the elastic deformation at the majority of ANET sites is dominated by
far-field mass change. Over 70% of ANET sites require ice mass change within a
radius of 200km or greater to be included before 90% of the site's elastic
deformation is recovered. We show that the difference between LSKs of a pair of
neighboring GNSS receivers can be used to localize the near-field mass change
responsible for the differential displacement. Finally, we generalize this in a
novel approach that uses an arbitrary number of GNSS sites. In this approach,
LSKs of each site are weighted and added in a linear series. These weights are
optimized such that the elastic deformation from mass change outside a Region
of Interest is minimized. We demonstrate that 7 ANET GNSS sites in the Amundsen
Sea region can isolate the elastic deformation, in both the vertical and
horizontal components, that results exclusively from PIG's mass loss and/or the
losses of the PSK glaciers. With the current GNSS receiver distribution, the
east component of elastic deformation due to mass change at Thwaites can be
expressed relative to mass changes at PSK. Our results demonstrate that the
current ANET configuration can use elastic deformation to constrain ice mass
changes in Antarctica, especially in regions with relatively dense clusters of
GNSS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06577v1
The dynamic nature of percolation on networks with triadic interactions,2022-04-23T21:54:23Z,"Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Jürgen Kurths, Ginestra Bianconi","Percolation establishes the connectivity of complex networks and is one of
the most fundamental critical phenomena for the study of complex systems. On
simple networks, percolation displays a second-order phase transition; on
multiplex networks, the percolation transition can become discontinuous.
However, little is known about percolation in networks with higher-order
interactions. Here, we show that percolation can be turned into a fully-fledged
dynamical process when higher-order interactions are taken into account. By
introducing signed triadic interactions, in which a node can regulate the
interactions between two other nodes, we define triadic percolation. We uncover
that in this paradigmatic model the connectivity of the network changes in time
and that the order parameter undergoes a period-doubling and a route to chaos.
We provide a general theory for triadic percolation which accurately predicts
the full phase diagram on random graphs as confirmed by extensive numerical
simulations. We find that triadic percolation on real network topologies
reveals a similar phenomenology. These results radically change our
understanding of percolation and may be used to study complex systems in which
the functional connectivity is changing in time dynamically and in a
non-trivial way, such as in neural and climate networks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13067v3

"UHI in Fortaleza and trends on screen-level air temperature and
  precipitation",2022-04-30T18:24:52Z,A. de A. Coelho,"There is a consensus that Urban Heat Island phenomenon - UHI occurs in every
large city. This effect is characterized by higher air temperatures in cities
than in the neighboring countryside at night. However, to date, there has been
no systematic study on the Fortaleza case, the Brazil's 5th largest city. By
the comparison between screen-level air temperature measured by two automatic
weather stations, one located in the city and the other in the neighboring
region, this work shows the occurrence of the UHI in Fortaleza, even during the
rainy season. In an attempt to find some effect of the UHI on precipitation
(and vice-versa), historical series of air temperature and precipitation were
analyzed from 1966 to 2020. Besides the considerable increase in air
temperature over the years, a slight downward trend was observed in UHI and
even more in accumulated precipitation between the hours of 15:00 and 21:00

greater areas with coral larvae, has a sensory suite for additional data

elements in such systems may interact with each other as a network, and
understanding the behavior of interacting tipping elements is a challenge
because of the high dimensionality originating from the network. Here we
develop a degree-based mean-field theory for a prototypical double-well system

Salinity-induced limits to Mangrove canopy height and diversity,2022-08-01T14:41:59Z,"Saverio Perri, Matteo Detto, Amilcare Porporato, Annalisa Molini","Mangrove canopy height is a key metric to assess tidal forests' resilience in
the face of climate change. In terrestrial forests, tree height is primarily
determined by water availability, plant hydraulic design, and disturbance
regime. However, the role of water stress remains elusive in tidal
environments, where saturated soils are prevalent, and salinity can
substantially affect the soil water potential. Here, we use global observations
of maximum canopy height, species richness, air temperature, and seawater
salinity -- a proxy of soil water salt concentration -- to explain the causal

stress affects Mangrove height both directly, by reducing primary productivity

salt-tolerant species, narrowing the spectrum of viable traits, and reducing
biodiversity. Yet, salt tolerance comes to a price. Highly salt-tolerant
mangroves are less productive and generally shorter than more sensitive

A probabilistic model of ocean floats under ice,2022-09-30T22:18:26Z,"Derek Hansen, Drew Yarger","The Argo project deploys thousands of floats throughout the world's oceans.
Carried only by the current, these floats take measurements such as temperature
and salinity at depths of up to two kilometers. These measurements are critical
for scientific tasks such as modeling climate change, estimating temperature
and salinity fields, and tracking the global hydrological cycle. In the
Southern Ocean, Argo floats frequently drift under ice cover which prevents
tracking via GPS. Managing this missing location data is an important
scientific challenge for the Argo project. To predict the floats' trajectories
under ice and quantify their uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic
state-space model (SSM) called ArgoSSM. ArgoSSM infers the posterior
distribution of a float's position and velocity at each time based on all
available data, which includes GPS measurements, ice cover, and potential
vorticity. This inference is achieved via an efficient particle filtering
scheme, which is effective despite the high signal-to0noise ratio in the GPS
data. Compared to existing interpolation approaches in oceanography, ArgoSSM
more accurately predicts held-out GPS measurements. Moreover, because
uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated in the posterior distribution,
ArgoSSM enables more robust and accurate temperature, salinity, and circulation
estimates.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00118v1
"Comparative Analysis and Calibration of Low Cost Resistive and

soil moisture monitoring to reduce unnecessary water usage. In recent times,
the use of low-cost sensors is becoming popular among farmers for soil moisture
monitoring. In this paper, a comparison of low-cost resistive and capacitive
soil moisture sensors is demonstrated in two ways. One way is the calibration
of the sensors in gravimetric and volumetric water content, and the other is
the sensors' response analysis when different quantities of water are added to

monitoring tasks. Employing prototypical systems from climate, optics and
ecology, we show that the digital twins can extrapolate the dynamics of the
target system to certain parameter regimes never experienced before, make
continual forecasting/monitoring with sparse real-time updates under
non-stationary external driving, infer hidden variables and accurately predict
their dynamical evolution, adapt to different forms of external driving, and
extrapolate the global bifurcation behaviors to systems of some different

proposed role in the global energy transition. While machine learning (ML)
methods have shown significant advantages over parametric, physics-informed

hinders their application in practice. We apply Shapley values, a popular
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, and the latest findings from
XAI for regression models, to uncover the strategies ML models have learned
from operational wind turbine data. Our findings reveal that the trend towards
ever larger model architectures, driven by a focus on test set performance, can
result in physically implausible model strategies. Therefore, we call for a
more prominent role of XAI methods in model selection. Moreover, we propose a

Linear and fractional response for nonlinear dissipative SPDEs,2022-10-21T17:36:55Z,"Giulia Carigi, Tobias Kuna, Jochen Bröcker","A framework to establish response theory for a class of nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDEs) is provided. More specifically, it is
shown that for a certain class of observables, the averages of those
observables against the stationary measure of the SPDE are differentiable
(linear response) or, under weaker conditions, locally H\""older continuous
(fractional response) as functions of a deterministic additive forcing. The
method allows to consider observables that are not necessarily differentiable.
For such observables, spectral gap results for the Markov semigroup associated
with the SPDE have recently been established that are fairly accessible. This
is important here as spectral gaps are a major ingredient for establishing
linear response. The results are applied to the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes
equation and the stochastic two-layer quasi-geostrophic model, an intermediate
complexity model popular in the geosciences to study atmosphere and ocean
dynamics. The physical motivation for studying the response to perturbations in

past actions). However, previous works do not offer a solution addressing all
these problems together. In this paper, we propose a novel causal relationship
learning framework for time-series data, called Rhino, which combines vector
auto-regression, deep learning and variational inference to model non-linear
relationships with instantaneous effects while allowing the noise distribution

and correct this market failure. Nonetheless, there is limited research
examining the extent such subsidies are successful in promoting charging
station supply. Using annual data on electric vehicle sales, charging station

heating but also groundwater flow or heat exchange with the atmosphere. This is
especially relevant in shallow landslides under seasonal and long-term climatic
forcing. How temperature controls the shear resistance in these landslides is
poorly constrained. We explored the response of two pure clays (Ca-bentonite
and kaolin) under landslide stress levels (50-150 kPa) and slow-to-rapid
shearing (0.018-44.5 mm/min). We modified a ring-shear device to permit
temperature control (20-50 C). We observed important heating-induced
strengthening in bentonite during slow shearing, but also weakening and again
strengthening during faster shearing. Effects in kaolin were generally of
opposite sign and lower magnitude compared to those in bentonite. Although more
analyses are warranted in natural soils and in a lower temperature range, we
argue that the thermal sensitivity of clays may matter not only in fast and
large, but also in slow and shallow landslides in clay soils. However,
case-by-case investigations should be performed to evaluate how thermal

evaluate different objectives, transform them into likelihood functions. As
likelihoods, their relative magnitude represents how strongly we should prefer
one objective versus another, and the log of that relation represents the
difference in their bit-length, as well as the difference in their uncertainty.
In other words, prefer whichever objective minimizes the uncertainty. Under the

  Environmental Protection Uses and Issues",2022-12-22T14:31:48Z,"Arnault Pachot, Céline Patissier","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to create more sustainable production
methods and model climate change, making it a valuable tool in the fight
against environmental degradation. This paper describes the paradox of an
energy-consuming technology serving the ecological challenges of tomorrow. The
study provides an overview of the sectors that use AI-based solutions for
environmental protection. It draws on numerous examples from AI for Green
players to present use cases and concrete examples. In the second part of the
study, the negative impacts of AI on the environment and the emerging
technological solutions to support Green AI are examined. It is also shown that
the research on less energy-consuming AI is motivated more by cost and energy
autonomy constraints than by environmental considerations. This leads to a
rebound effect that favors an increase in the complexity of models. Finally,
the need to integrate environmental indicators into algorithms is discussed.
The environmental dimension is part of the broader ethical problem of AI, and
addressing it is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of AI in the long

critical role in model development and calibration. In many applications, there
are multiple uncertain parameters in a model which must be estimated. Although
the Bayesian formulation is attractive for such problems, computational cost
and high dimensionality frequently prohibit a thorough exploration of the
parametric uncertainty. A common approach is to reduce the dimension by fixing
some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters) to a best estimate
and use techniques from PDE-constrained optimization to approximate properties
of the Bayesian posterior distribution. For instance, the maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) and the Laplace approximation of the posterior covariance can
be computed. In this article, we propose using hyper-differential sensitivity
analysis (HDSA) to assess the sensitivity of the MAP point to changes in the
auxiliary parameters. We establish an interpretation of HDSA as correlations in

focuses on the assimilation of 2D flood extent data (expressed in terms of wet
surface ratios) and in-situ water level data to improve the representation of
the flood plain dynamics with a Telemac-2D model and an Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF). The EnKF control vector was composed friction coefficients and
corrective parameter to the input forcing. It is then augmented with the water
level state averaged over several floodplain zones. This work was conducted in
the context of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) based on a real
flood event occurred in January-February 2021 on the Garonne Marmandaise
catchment. This allows to validate the observation operator associated to the
wet surface ratio observations as well as the dual state-parameter sequential
correction implemented in this work. The merits of assimilating SAR- derived
flood plain data complementary to in-situ water level observations are shown in
the control parameter and observation spaces with 1D and 2D assessment metrics.

valuable for modeling attributes of forest structure including AGB, yet most
LiDAR collections take place at local or regional scales covering irregular,

leveraging a LiDAR patchwork for AGB mapping at landscape scales, including
selection of training data, the investigation of regional or coverage specific
patterns in prediction error, and map agreement with field inventory across
multiple scales. Three machine learning algorithms and an ensemble model were
trained with FIA field measurements, airborne LiDAR, and topographic, climatic

"Sustaining Security and Safety in ICT: A Quest for Terminology,
  Objectives, and Limits",2022-06-01T07:46:17Z,Jan Tobias Muehlberg,"Security and safety are intertwined concepts in the world of computing. In
recent years, the terms ""sustainable security"" and ""sustainable safety"" came
into fashion and are being used referring to a variety of systems properties
ranging from efficiency to profitability, and sometimes meaning that a product
or service is good for people and planet. This leads to confusing perceptions
of products where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed
without child labour, while the producer uses the term to signify that their
new product uses marginally less power than the previous generation of that
products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different
notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards
optimising our subject of study towards one specific sustainability metric -
let's say energy consumption - while being blissfully unaware of, e.g., social
impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.
  In this paper I dissect the idea of sustainable safety and security, starting
from the questions of what we want to sustain, and for whom we want to sustain
it. I believe that a general ""people and planet"" answer is inadequate here
because this form of sustainability cannot be the property of a single industry
sector but must be addressed by society as a whole. However, with sufficient
understanding of life-cycle impacts we may very well be able to devise research
and development efforts, and inform decision making processes towards the use
of integrated safety and security solutions that help us to address societal
challenges in the context of the climate and ecological crises, and that are
aligned with concepts such as intersectionality and climate justice. Of course,
these solutions can only be effective if they are embedded in societal and

within the pore spaces and it is a crucial parameter of Hydro-Meteorological
processes. The behaviour of soil moisture water changes spatially and
temporally in response to topography, soil characteristics, and climate[1].
Soil moisture is overseen by various hydro-meteorological factors that vary
vertically with depth, laterally across terrestrial shapes, and temporarily in
feedback to the climate. The precise monitoring and quantification of
high-resolution surface and subsurface soil moisture observations are very
important [13]. This paper highlights the outcomes of the fieldwork carried out

part of the second stage. Finally, the third stage includes real-time data
visualization using a mobile application and data server for analysing soil
moisture and temperature. The soil moisture profile obtained through the sensor

broadly into three classes: i) cool planets with homogeneous cloud coverage,
ii) intermediate temperature planets with asymmetric dayside cloud coverage,
and iii) ultra-hot planets without clouds on the dayside. In class ii),} the
dayside cloud patterns are shaped by the wind flow and irradiation. Surface
gravity and planetary rotation have little effect. Extended atmosphere profiles
suggest the formation of mineral haze in form of metal-oxide clusters (e.g.
(TiO2)_N). The dayside cloud coverage is the tell-tale sign for the different
planetary regimes and their resulting weather and climate appearance. Class (i)
is representative of planets with a very homogeneous cloud particle size and
material compositions across the globe (e.g., HATS-6b, NGTS-1b), classes (ii,
e.g., WASP-43b, HD\,209458b) and (iii, e.g., WASP-121b, WP0137b) have a large
day/night divergence of the cloud properties. The C/O ratio is, hence,
homogeneously affected in class (i), but asymmetrically in class (ii) and
(iii). The atmospheres of class (i) and (ii) planets are little affected by

  global dust storm",2022-08-25T23:19:43Z,"Tanguy Bertrand, Melinda Kahre, Richard Urata, Anni Määttänen, Franck Montmessin, John Wilson, Mike Wolff","Coagulation of particles occurs when two particles collide and stick
together. In the Martian atmosphere, dust coagulation would increase the
effective particle size, as small particles accrete to larger particles. Murphy
et al. (1990) showed that Brownian coagulation of dust in the Martian
atmosphere was not significant, due to the low dust particle mixing ratios,
while Montmessin et al. (2002) and Fedorova et al. (2014) showed that it mostly
involves particle radii smaller than 0.1 um. However, the effects of
coagulation have never been explored in 3D, during a global dust storm, i.e. in
presence of larger numbers of small particles. Here we revisit this issue by
using the NASA Ames Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM) to investigate the
temporal and spatial changes in dust particle sizes during the 2018 global
storm due to coagulation and the overall impact of these processes on Mars'
climate. Our parameterization for coagulation includes the effect of Brownian
motion, Brownian diffusion enhancement, and gravitational collection. We show
that Brownian motion and Brownian diffusion enhancement dominate gravitational
collection. The impact of coagulation is significant during the storm, with
coagulation rates increased by a factor of 10 compared to non-storm conditions.
The effective particle radius can be increased by a factor of 2 due to
coagulation, leading to a 20K colder atmosphere above 30 km altitude. Overall,
our parameterization improves the representation of the decay phase of the
storm relative to observations. The process remains significant outside the
storm period if large numbers of submicron-sized particles are involved. It may
be possible, in GCMs, to lift larger amounts of submicron-sized particles from
the surface without excess dust buildup in the atmosphere, thus improving the
agreement with some of the observations without diverging from the observed
column opacities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12374v2

variation due to the rapid shift of stellar irradiation provides a unique
opportunity to probe the physical and chemical timescales and to study the
interplay between climate dynamics and atmospheric chemistry. In this work, we
present integrated models to study the atmospheric responses and the underlying
physical and chemical mechanisms of HD 80606 b. We first run three-dimensional
general circulation models (GCMs) to establish the atmospheric thermal and
dynamical structures for different atmospheric metallicities and internal heat.
Based on the GCM output, we then adopted a 1D time-dependent photochemical
model to investigate the compositional variation along the eccentric orbit. The
transition of the circulation patterns of HD 80606 b matched the dynamics
regimes in previous works. Our photochemical models show that efficient
vertical mixing leads to deep quench levels of the major carbon and nitrogen
species and the quenching behavior does not change throughout the eccentric
orbit. Instead, photolysis is the main driver of the time-dependent chemistry.
While CH$_4$ dominates over CO through most of the orbits, a transient state of
[CO]/[CH$_4$}] $>$ 1 after periastron is confirmed for all metallicity and
internal heat cases. The upcoming JWST Cycle 1 GO program will be able to track
this real-time CH$_4$--CO conversion and infer the chemical timescale.

forcing exhibit both short-term and long-term cycles, opening an interesting
avenue for detecting sulfur on exoplanets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05910v2

Proterozoic geological eon 2.4 billion years ago. Using WACCM6, an Earth System
Model, we simulate the atmosphere of Earth-analogue exoplanets with O$_2$
mixing ratios between 0.1% and 150% PAL. Using these simulations, we calculate
the reflection/emission spectra over multiple orbits using the Planetary
Spectrum Generator. We highlight how observer angle, albedo, chemistry, and
clouds affect the simulated observations. We show that inter-annual climate
variations, as well short-term variations due to clouds, can be observed in our
simulated atmospheres with a telescope concept such as LUVOIR or HabEx. Annual
variability and seasonal variability can change the planet's reflected flux
(including the reflected flux of key spectral features such as O$_2$ and
H$_2$O) by up to factors of 5 and 20, respectively, for the same orbital phase.
This variability is best observed with a high-throughput coronagraph. For
example, HabEx (4 m) with a starshade performs up to a factor of two times
better than a LUVOIR B (6 m) style telescope. The variability and
signal-to-noise ratio of some spectral features depends non-linearly on

by 3-m and 8-m-class observatories compares favourably with synthetic images
based on both Cassini-derived temperature records and the predictions of
radiative climate models. 8-m class facilities are capable of resolving thermal
contrasts on the scale of Saturn's belts, zones, polar hexagon, and polar
cyclones, superimposed onto large-scale seasonal asymmetries. Seasonal changes
in brightness temperatures of $\sim30$ K in the stratosphere and $\sim10$ K in
the upper troposphere are observed, as the northern and southern polar
stratospheric vortices (NPSV and SPSV) form in spring and dissipate in autumn.
The timings of the first appearance of the warm polar vortices is successfully
reproduced by radiative climate models, confirming them to be radiative
phenomena, albeit entrained within sharp boundaries influenced by dynamics.
Axisymmetric thermal bands (4-5 per hemisphere) display temperature gradients
that are strongly correlated with Saturn's zonal winds, indicating winds that
decay in strength with altitude, and implying meridional circulation cells
forming the system of cool zones and warm belts. Saturn's thermal structure is
largely repeatable from year to year (via comparison of infrared images in 1989

inter-annual variations because the equatorial banding at 7.9 $\mu$m is
inconsistent with a $\sim15$-year period for Saturn's equatorial stratospheric
oscillation, i.e., it is not strictly semi-annual. Finally, observations
between 2017-2022 extend the legacy of the Cassini mission, revealing the

prediction uncertainty. Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used for this

troposphere-stratosphere temperature climatology, global land surface air
temperature, GMST, sea ice extent (SIE) and snow cover extent (SCE), combined
with modeled calculations of GLSTs and GMSTs. The observed and analyzed results

change over the past two and a half decades. Upper stratospheric warming at
high latitudes has been observed and GMST or global land surface air
temperature has reached a plateau since the mid-2000s with the removal of
natural effects. In marked contrast, continued drastic warmings at the coasts
of polar regions (particularly Russia and Alaska) are observed and well
explained by the sea-ice-loss warming amplification mechanism. The calculated
GMSTs by the parameter-free quantum-physics warming model of halogenated
greenhouse gases (GHGs) show excellent agreement with the observed GMSTs after
the natural El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and volcanic effects are

heavy rainfall and flooding. This technical report deals with the question of
how rescue commanders can be better and faster provided with current
information during flood disasters using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e.
during the flood in July 2021 in Central Europe, more specifically in Erftstadt
/ Blessem. The UAVs were used for live observation and regular inspections of
the flood edge on the one hand, and on the other hand for the systematic data
acquisition in order to calculate 3D models using Structure from Motion and
MultiView Stereo. The 3D models embedded in a GIS application serve as a
planning basis for the systematic exploration and decision support for the
deployment of additional smaller UAVs but also rescue forces. The systematic
data acquisition of the UAVs by means of autonomous meander flights provides
high-resolution images which are computed to a georeferenced 3D model of the
surrounding area within 15 minutes in a specially equipped robotic command
vehicle (RobLW). From the comparison of high-resolution elevation profiles
extracted from the 3D model on successive days, changes in the water level
become visible. This information enables the emergency management to plan
further inspections of the buildings and to search for missing persons on site.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03084v1
"Spatial predictions on physically constrained domains: Applications to
  Arctic sea salinity data",2022-10-08T04:41:43Z,"Bora Jin, Amy H. Herring, David Dunson","In this paper we predict sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Arctic Ocean based
on satellite measurements. SSS is a crucial indicator for ongoing changes in
the Arctic Ocean and can offer important insights about climate change. We
particularly focus on areas of water mistakenly flagged as ice by satellite
algorithms. To remove bias in the retrieval of salinity near sea ice, the
algorithms use conservative ice masks, which result in considerable loss of
data. We aim to produce realistic SSS values for such regions to obtain more
complete understanding about the SSS surface over the Arctic Ocean and benefit
future applications that may require SSS measurements near edges of sea ice or
coasts. We propose a class of scalable nonstationary processes that can handle
large data from satellite products and complex geometries of the Arctic Ocean.
Barrier overlap-removal acyclic directed graph GP (BORA-GP) constructs sparse
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with neighbors conforming to barriers and
boundaries, enabling characterization of dependence in constrained domains. The
BORA-GP models produce more sensible SSS values in regions without satellite
measurements and show improved performance in various constrained domains in

Reduced scale trees were chosen to mimic a realistic shape and aerodynamic
behaviour. Three different spacings between the trees were considered. A
passive scalar was injected from a line source placed at ground level and
concentration measurements were performed in the whole canyon. Results show
that the presence of trees alters the concentration pattern in the street with
a progressive shift from a nearly two-dimensional to a three-dimensional field

the overall ventilation efficiency, does not show a specific trend with the

temporally, at desired temporal resolution, and spatially, according to region
of interest, using data generated from suitable space-time models. These tools
include predictive spatial probability surfaces and spatial extents for an
event. Working with exceedance events around the center of the temperature
distribution, the probability surfaces capture the spatial variation in the
risk of an exceedance event, while the spatial extents capture the expected
proportion of incidence of a given exceedance event for a region of interest.
Importantly, the proposed tools can be used with the output from any suitable
model fitted to any set of spatially referenced time series data.
  As an illustration, we employ a dataset from 1956 to 2015 collected at 18
stations over Arag\'{o}n in Spain, and a collection of daily maximum
temperature series obtained from posterior predictive simulation of a Bayesian
hierarchical daily temperature model. The results for the summer period show
that although there is an increasing risk in all the events used to quantify
the effects of climate change, it is not spatially homogeneous, with the
largest increase arising in the center of Ebro valley and Eastern Pyrenees
area. The risk of an increase of the average temperature between 1966-1975 and
2006-2015 higher than $1^\circ$C is higher than 0.5 all over the region, and
close to 1 in the previous areas. The extent of daily temperature higher than

process modeling of intercepts, slope coefficients, variances, and
autocorrelations. The model is expressed in a form which separates fixed
effects from random effects and also separates space, years, and days for each
type of effect. Motivated by exploratory data analysis, fixed effects to
capture the influence of elevation, seasonality and a linear trend are
employed. Pure errors are introduced for years, for locations within years, and

cities lack a spatial catalog of their surfaces due to the cost-prohibitive and
time-consuming nature of data collection. Recent advancements in computer
vision, together with the availability of street-level images, provide new
opportunities for cities to extract large-scale built environment data with

evaluated the framework using images from six different cities, demonstrating
that it can be applied to regions with distinct urban fabrics, even outside the

Understanding the controls on marine environmental conditions and biological

global challenges. Photovoltaics has been instrumental in mitigation of CO$_2$

warming to 1.5 $^\circ$C increasingly requires additional approaches. The paper
presents how PV surfaces can be designed to reverse the Earth's radiative
imbalance from increased greenhouse gasses that lead to higher global
temperatures. The new PV surface generate electricity, reflect sub-band gap
radiation, minimize their temperature, generate thermal radiation and emit
additional IR through the atmospheric, with these processes totaling 650
Wm$^{-2}$. This is realized by: (1) PV system efficiency at operating
temperature $>$ 20 \% and sub-band gap reflection of 150 Wm$^{-2}$ for a total
of 350 Wm$^{-2}$ (2) Thermally emitted radiation (radiative cooling) of 150
Wm$^{-2}$; and (3) Active IR emission through an atmospheric window at 1.5
$\mu$ of 150 Wm$^{-2}$. With such PV surfaces, we show that 10 TW of installed
PV can reverse global warming. Using PV to balance global temperatures
introduces additional considerations for PV, focusing on high efficiency,

The Habitable Zones of Rapidly Rotating Main Sequence A/F Stars,2022-02-14T18:23:48Z,"John P. Ahlers, Emeline F. Fromont, Ravi Kopparappu, P. Wilson Cauley, Jacob Haqq-Misra","We investigate how rapid stellar rotation commonly seen in A/F stars can
influence planet habitability. Specifically, we model how rapid rotation
influences a planet's irradiation and determine the location of the habitable
zone for stars in the mass range $1.3M_\odot\leq M_\star\leq 2.2M_\odot$. Rapid
stellar rotation can dramatically change a star's luminosity and spectral
energy distribution and, therefore, can impact the habitability of any
surrounding planets. Stars of mass $M_\star\gtrsim1.3M_\odot$ commonly rotate
near their breakup speeds, which causes two effects relevant to planet
habitability. First, these stars flatten into oblate spheroids with shorter
polar radii and elongated equatorial radii. Second, rapid rotation induces a
pole-to-equator temperature gradient on the surface of these stars. Using a 1D
climate model, we calculate the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone of
well-known rapid rotators and average theoretical stars in our stellar mass
range. We find that, in general, rapid rotation causes the habitable zone to
reside closer in than for a non-rotating equivalent star. We also find that
gravity darkening dramatically reduces stellar UV emission, which combats the
common assumption that high-mass stars emit too much UV light for habitable
worlds. Overall, we determine that rapid stellar rotation has important
consequences for the overall habitability of a system and must be accounted for
both when modeling exoplanet environments and in observation of planets around
high-mass stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06918v1

of ENSO complexity, which is a central problem in contemporary meteorology with
large societal impacts. The information theory advances a unique way to
quantify the forecast uncertainty and allows to distinguish the predictability
limit of different ENSO events. One key step in applying the framework to
compute the information gain representing the predictability is to build a
statistically accurate dynamical model. To this end, a recently developed
multiscale stochastic model, which succeeds in capturing both the large-scale
dynamics and many crucial statistical properties of the observed ENSO
complexity, is incorporated into the information-theoretic framework. It is
shown that different ENSO events possess very distinct predictability limits.
In addition to the ensemble mean, the ensemble spread also has remarkable
contributions to the predictability. While the information theory indicates
that predicting the onset of the eastern Pacific El Ni\~nos is challenging, it
reveals a universal tendency to convert strong predictability to skillful
forecast for predicting many central Pacific El Ni\~nos about two years in
advance. In addition, strong predictability is found for the La Ni\~na events,
corresponding to the effective discharge process. In the climate change
scenario with the strengthening of the background Walker circulation, the
predictability of sea surface temperature in central Pacific has a significant
response with a notable increase in summer and fall. Finally, the Gaussian

labour. In this paper we explore the use of deep generative models to
simultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts

Wildfire risk forecast: An optimizable fire danger index,2022-03-28T14:08:49Z,"Eduardo Rodrigues, Bianca Zadrozny, Campbell Watson","Wildfire events have caused severe losses in many places around the world and
are expected to increase with climate change. Throughout the years many
technologies have been developed to identify fire events early on and to
simulate fire behavior once they have started. Another particularly helpful
technology is fire risk indices, which use weather forcing to make advanced
predictions of the risk of fire. Predictions of fire risk indices can be used,
for instance, to allocate resources in places with high risk. These indices
have been developed over the years as empirical models with parameters that
were estimated in lab experiments and field tests. These parameters, however,
may not fit well all places where these models are used. In this paper we
propose a novel implementation of one index (NFDRS IC) as a differentiable
function in which one can optimize its internal parameters via gradient
descent. We leverage existing machine learning frameworks (PyTorch) to
construct our model. This approach has two benefits: (1) the NFDRS IC
parameters can be improved for each region using actual observed fire events,
and (2) the internal variables remain intact for interpretations by specialists
instead of meaningless hidden layers as in traditional neural networks. In this
paper we evaluate our strategy with actual fire events for locations in the USA
and Europe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15558v1
"Texture based Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation of
  Forest Cover: Generalizing for Different Geographical Regions",2022-03-29T15:48:17Z,"Gokul P, Ujjwal Verma","Forest plays a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating
climate change besides maintaining the world's biodiversity. The existing
satellite-based forest monitoring system utilizes supervised learning
approaches that are limited to a particular region and depend on manually
annotated data to identify forest. This work envisages forest identification as
a few-shot semantic segmentation task to achieve generalization across
different geographical regions. The proposed few-shot segmentation approach
incorporates a texture attention module in the prototypical network to
highlight the texture features of the forest. Indeed, the forest exhibits a
characteristic texture different from other classes, such as road, water, etc.
In this work, the proposed approach is trained for identifying tropical forests
of South Asia and adapted to determine the temperate forest of Central Europe
with the help of a few (one image for 1-shot) manually annotated support images
of the temperate forest. An IoU of 0.62 for forest class (1-way 1-shot) was
obtained using the proposed method, which is significantly higher (0.46 for
PANet) than the existing few-shot semantic segmentation approach. This result
demonstrates that the proposed approach can generalize across geographical
regions for forest identification, creating an opportunity to develop a global
forest cover identification tool.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15687v2
"Wind Farm Layout Optimisation using Set Based Multi-objective Bayesian
  Optimisation",2022-03-31T14:33:50Z,"Tinkle Chugh, Endi Ymeraj","Wind energy is one of the cleanest renewable electricity sources and can help
in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17065v2

emergency management resources. Sensor networks have grown in popularity in
data collection and processing capabilities for a variety of applications in
industries such as medical, environmental monitoring, home automation etc.
Semantic sensor networks can collect various climatic circumstances like wind

"Sharing the Load: Considering Fairness in De-energization Scheduling to
  Mitigate Wildfire Ignition Risk using Rolling Optimization",2022-04-13T17:42:32Z,"Alyssa Kody, Amanda West, Daniel K. Molzahn","Wildfires are a threat to public safety and have increased in both frequency
and severity due to climate change. To mitigate wildfire ignition risks,
electric power system operators proactively de-energize high-risk power lines
during ""public safety power shut-off"" (PSPS) events. Line de-energizations can
cause communities to lose power, which may result in negative economic, health,
and safety impacts. Furthermore, the same communities may repeatedly experience
power shutoffs over the course of a wildfire season, which compounds these
negative impacts. However, there may be many combinations of power lines whose
de-energization will result in about the same reduction of system-wide wildfire
risk, but the associated power outages affect different communities. Therefore,
one may raise concerns regarding the fairness of de-energization decisions.
Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework to select lines to de-energize in
order to balance wildfire risk reduction, total load shedding, and fairness
considerations. The goal of the framework is to prevent a small fraction of
communities from disproportionally being impacted by PSPS events, and to
instead more equally share the burden of power outages. For a geolocated test
case in the southwestern United States, we use actual California demand data as
well as real wildfire risk forecasts to simulate PSPS events during the 2021
wildfire season and compare the performance of various methods for promoting
fairness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed formulation can provide
significantly more fair outcomes with limited impacts on system-wide
performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06543v2

"Impacts of Variable-Impedance-Based Power Flow Control on Renewable
  Energy Integration",2022-04-27T00:51:13Z,"Omid Mirzapour, Mostafa Sahraei-Ardakani","The electric power grid has evolved significantly over the past two decades
in response to climate change. Increased levels of renewable energy generation,
as a prominent feature of this evolution, have led to new congestion patterns
in the transmission network. The transmission system is originally designed for
conventional energy sources, with predictable flow patterns. Insufficient
transfer capability in congested transmission systems results in commitment of
more expensive power plants and higher levels of renewable energy curtailment.
One way to mitigate congestion is adoption of power flow control through
variable-impedance flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices. In this
paper the impacts of power flow control on generation cost, carbon emissions
and renewable energy curtailment are studied under a wide range of scenarios,
including generation mix from major US regional transmission organizations, and
different load curves, representing seasonal variations. A two-stage stochastic
unit commitment, including FACTS adjustment, is used to evaluate the impacts of

the influential factors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12642v1

coastal and ocean environment due to the scale of threats posed by climate
change and the limited resources to fill knowledge gaps. Using data from the
annotation activity of citizen scientists in a Swedish marine project, we
constructed Deep Neural Network models to predict forthcoming engagement. We
tested the models to identify patterns in annotation engagement. Based on the
results, it is possible to predict whether an annotator will remain active in
future sessions. Depending on the goals of individual citizen science projects,
it may also be necessary to identify either those volunteers who will leave or
those who will continue annotating. This can be predicted by varying the
threshold for the prediction. The engagement metrics used to construct the
models are based on time and activity and can be used to infer latent
characteristics of volunteers and predict their task interest based on their
activity patterns. They can estimate if volunteers can accomplish a given
number of tasks in a certain amount of time, identify early on who is likely to
become a top contributor or identify who is likely to quit and provide them
with targeted interventions. The novelty of our predictive models lies in the
use of Deep Neural Networks and the sequence of volunteer annotations. A
limitation of our models is that they do not use embeddings constructed from

several countries committed to phasing down coal electricity as soon as
possible, deactivating hundreds of power plants in the near future. CO$_2$-free
electricity can be generated in these plants by retrofitting them for iron
combustion. Iron oxides produced during the process can be collected and
reduced back to metallic iron using H$_2$, in a circular process where it
becomes an energy carrier. Using clean energy in the recycling process enables
storage and distribution of excess generated in periods of abundance. This
concept uses and scales up existing dry metal cycle technologies, which are the
focus of extensive research worldwide. Retrofitting is evaluated here to
determine feasibility of adding these material requirements to markets, in the
context of current plans for decarbonization of steel industry, and policies on
hydrogen and renewable electricity. Results indicate that not only for a single
power plant, but also on larger scales, the retrofitting plan is viable,
promoting and supporting advancements in sustainable electricity, steel
industry and hydrogen production, converging necessary technological and
construction efforts. The maturation and first commercial-scale application of
iron combustion technology by 2030, together with developing necessary
reduction infrastructure over the next decades, would pave the way for
large-scale retrofitting and support the phasing out of coal in many regions.

  model on triangular meshes",2022-05-29T02:39:49Z,"Weizhang Huang, Ruo Li, Jianxian Qiu, Min Zhang","A well-balanced moving mesh discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is proposed
for the numerical solution of the Ripa model -- a generalization of the shallow
water equations that accounts for effects of water temperature variations.
Thermodynamic processes are important particularly in the upper layers of the
ocean where the variations of sea surface temperature play a fundamental role
in climate change. The well-balance property which requires numerical schemes
to preserve the lake-at-rest steady state is crucial to the simulation of
perturbation waves over that steady state such as waves on a lake or tsunami
waves in the deep ocean. To ensure the well-balance, positivity-preserving, and
high-order properties, a DG-interpolation scheme (with or without scaling
positivity-preserving limiter) and special treatments pertaining to the Ripa
model are employed in the transfer of both the flow variables and bottom
topography from the old mesh to the new one and in the TVB limiting process.
Mesh adaptivity is realized using an MMPDE moving mesh approach and a metric
tensor based on an equilibrium variable and water depth. A motivation is to
adapt the mesh according to both the perturbations of the lake-at-rest steady
state and the water depth distribution (bottom structure). Numerical examples
in one and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the well-balance,
high-order accuracy, and positivity-preserving properties of the method and its
ability to capture small perturbations of the lake-at-rest steady state.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14560v1

extreme hydrologic loading, and design oversights related to the changing
climate. Understanding and mitigating risk to downstream inhabited areas
require developing and improving low-cost high-fidelity tools, such as
numerical models, which allow emergency managers to predict the consequences of
dam failures better. Two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged hydraulic models can
provide valuable insights into the importance of breach parameters or
downstream flow characteristics, but historical studies considering historic
failures using real topographies are less common in literature. This study
compares Geoclaw, a 2D hydraulic model with adaptive mesh refinement
capabilities, to an industry-standard software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering
Center - River Analysis System) using the 1976 Teton Dam failure as a case
study. The suitability of Geoclaw for dam failure modeling is determined based
on its capability to resolve inundation extent and flood wave arrival times.
This study performs sensitivity analyses of the HEC-RAS model to compare an
instantaneous dam breach assumption with a time-dependent breach formation for
quantifying the model uncertainty. We find the 2D Geoclaw dam-break model
results compare reasonably with historical gauge and field observational data
and HEC-RAS results. The model demonstrates stability and relatively low
computational costs. Our findings highlight opportunities for future work, with
the Geoclaw software performance supporting continued studies to evaluate
performance. Outcomes of this study will assist dam owners, floodplain

them as an open-source resource to the research community. We find that GNNs
are surprisingly effective at predicting the highly non-linear targets from
topological information only. For the first time, performance that is suitable
for practical use cases is achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of
these models to accurately identify particular vulnerable nodes in power grids,

Magnetic signature of vertically migrating aggregations in the ocean,2022-07-07T21:30:21Z,"Matt K. Fu, John O. Dabiri","The transport of heat and solutes by vertically migrating aggregations of
plankton has long been explored as a potentially important source of ocean
mixing. However, direct evidence of enhanced mixing due to these migrations
remains challenging to obtain and inconclusive. These shortcomings are due to
the limitations of current measurement techniques, i.e., velocimetry
techniques, which require a priori knowledge of the precise aggregation
location and typically trigger animal avoidance behavior from introducing
instrumentation into the migration. Here we develop a new approach to overcome
these longstanding limitations by leveraging advancements in modern
magnetometry to detect the flow-induced magnetic fields that naturally arise
from seawater as it moves through the Earth's geomagnetic field. We derive
quantitative predictions showing that these flow-induced magnetic fields in the
vicinity of migrating aggregations have a strength proportional to the
integrated fluid transport due to the migration. Importantly these magnetic
signatures are potentially detectable remotely at a significant distance far
from the aggregation and region of moving fluid with emerging quantum-enhanced
magnetometry techniques such as Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond. These

Softening online extremes organically and at scale,2022-05-29T21:10:13Z,"Elvira Maria Restrepo, Martin Moreno, Lucia Illari, Neil F. Johnson","Calls are escalating for social media platforms to do more to mitigate
extreme online communities whose views can lead to real-world harms, e.g.,
mis/disinformation and distrust that increased Covid-19 fatalities, and now
extend to monkeypox, unsafe baby formula alternatives, cancer, abortions, and
climate change; white replacement that inspired the 2022 Buffalo shooter and
will likely inspire others; anger that threatens elections, e.g., 2021 U.S.
Capitol attack; notions of male supremacy that encourage abuse of women;
anti-Semitism, anti-LGBQT hate and QAnon conspiracies. But should 'doing more'
mean doing more of the same, or something different? If so, what? Here we start
by showing why platforms doing more of the same will not solve the problem.
Specifically, our analysis of nearly 100 million Facebook users entangled over
vaccines and now Covid and beyond, shows that the extreme communities' ecology
has a hidden resilience to Facebook's removal interventions; that Facebook's
messaging interventions are missing key audience sectors and getting ridiculed;
that a key piece of these online extremes' narratives is being mislabeled as
incorrect science; and that the threat of censorship is inciting the creation
of parallel presences on other platforms with potentially broader audiences. We
then demonstrate empirically a new solution that can soften online extremes
organically without having to censor or remove communities or their content, or
check or correct facts, or promote any preventative messaging, or seek a
consensus. This solution can be automated at scale across social media
platforms quickly and with minimal cost.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10063v1
Dynamic Load Altering EV Attacks Against Power Grid Frequency Control,2022-07-20T18:18:12Z,"Mohammad Ali Sayed, Mohsen Ghafouri, Mourad Debbabi, Chadi Assi","Driven by the necessity to combat climate change, Electric Vehicles (EV) are
being deployed to take advantage of their ability in reducing emissions

an attacker\'s perspective and proposes a dynamic load altering strategy
through manipulating EV charging to destabilize the grid. The attack is
formulated based on feedback control theory, i.e., designing an attack based on
Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). After the stability metric and controller

Data-Driven Stochastic AC-OPF using Gaussian Processes,2022-07-21T23:02:35Z,"Mile Mitrovic, Aleksandr Lukashevich, Petr Vorobev, Vladimir Terzija, Semen Budenny, Yury Maximov, Deepjyoti Deka","In recent years, electricity generation has been responsible for more than a
quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Integrating a significant
amount of renewables into a power grid is probably the most accessible way to
reduce carbon emissions from power grids and slow down climate change.
Unfortunately, the most accessible renewable power sources, such as wind and
solar, are highly fluctuating and thus bring a lot of uncertainty to power grid
operations and challenge existing optimization and control policies. The
chance-constrained alternating current (AC) optimal power flow (OPF) framework
finds the minimum cost generation dispatch maintaining the power grid
operations within security limits with a prescribed probability. Unfortunately,
the AC-OPF problem's chance-constrained extension is non-convex,
computationally challenging, and requires knowledge of system parameters and
additional assumptions on the behavior of renewable distribution. Known linear
and convex approximations to the above problems, though tractable, are too
conservative for operational practice and do not consider uncertainty in system
parameters. This paper presents an alternative data-driven approach based on
Gaussian process (GP) regression to close this gap. The GP approach learns a
simple yet non-convex data-driven approximation to the AC power flow equations
that can incorporate uncertainty inputs. The latter is then used to determine
the solution of CC-OPF efficiently, by accounting for both input and parameter
uncertainty. The practical efficiency of the proposed approach using different
approximations for GP-uncertainty propagation is illustrated over numerous IEEE
test cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10781v1
"Learning to identify cracks on wind turbine blade surfaces using
  drone-based inspection images",2022-07-20T18:37:25Z,"Akshay Iyer, Linh Nguyen, Shweta Khushu","Wind energy is expected to be one of the leading ways to achieve the goals of
the Paris Agreement but it in turn heavily depends on effective management of
its operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Blade failures account for
one-third of all O&M costs thus making accurate detection of blade damages,
especially cracks, very important for sustained operations and cost savings.
Traditionally, damage inspection has been a completely manual process thus
making it subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. Hence in this work, we
bring more objectivity, scalability, and repeatability in our damage inspection
process, using deep learning, to miss fewer cracks. We build a deep learning
model trained on a large dataset of blade damages, collected by our drone-based
inspection, to correctly detect cracks. Our model is already in production and
has processed more than a million damages with a recall of 0.96. We also focus
on model interpretability using class activation maps to get a peek into the
model workings. The model not only performs as good as human experts but also
better in certain tricky cases. Thus, in this work, we aim to increase wind
energy adoption by decreasing one of its major hurdles - the O\&M costs
resulting from missing blade failures like cracks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11186v1
Investigating the Validity of Botometer-based Social Bot Studies,2022-07-23T09:31:30Z,"Florian Gallwitz, Michael Kreil","The idea that social media platforms like Twitter are inhabited by vast
numbers of social bots has become widely accepted in recent years. Social bots
are assumed to be automated social media accounts operated by malicious actors
with the goal of manipulating public opinion. They are credited with the
ability to produce content autonomously and to interact with human users.
Social bot activity has been reported in many different political contexts,
including the U.S. presidential elections, discussions about migration, climate
change, and COVID-19. However, the relevant publications either use crude and
questionable heuristics to discriminate between supposed social bots and humans
or -- in the vast majority of the cases -- fully rely on the output of
automatic bot detection tools, most commonly Botometer. In this paper, we point
out a fundamental theoretical flaw in the widely-used study design for
estimating the prevalence of social bots. Furthermore, we empirically
investigate the validity of peer-reviewed Botometer-based studies by closely
and systematically inspecting hundreds of accounts that had been counted as
social bots. We were unable to find a single social bot. Instead, we found
mostly accounts undoubtedly operated by human users, the vast majority of them
using Twitter in an inconspicuous and unremarkable fashion without the
slightest traces of automation. We conclude that studies claiming to
investigate the prevalence, properties, or influence of social bots based on
Botometer have, in reality, just investigated false positives and artifacts of
this approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11474v1
Emergent structure and dynamics of tropical forest-grassland landscapes,2022-07-28T14:32:18Z,"Bert Wuyts, Jan Sieber","Previous work indicates that tropical forest can exist as an alternative
stable state to savanna. Therefore, perturbation by climate change or human
impact may lead to crossing of a tipping point beyond which there is rapid
forest dieback that is not easily reversed. A hypothesised mechanism for such
bistability is a feedback between fire and vegetation, where fire spreads as a
contagion process on grass patches. Theoretical models have largely implemented
this mechanism implicitly, by assuming a threshold dependence of fire spread on
flammable vegetation. Here, we show how the nonlinear dynamics and bistability
emerge spontaneously, without assuming equations or thresholds for fire spread.
We find that the forest geometry causes the nonlinearity that induces
bistability. We demonstrate this in three steps. First, we model forest and
fire as interacting contagion processes on grass patches, %using a cellular
automaton showing that spatial structure emerges due to two counteracting
effects on the forest perimeter: forest expansion by dispersal, and forest
erosion by fires originating in adjacent grassland. Then, we derive a
landscape-scale balance equation in which these two effects link forest
geometry and dynamics: forest expands proportionally to its perimeter, while it
shrinks proportionally to its perimeter weighted by adjacent grassland area.
Finally, we show that these perimeter quantities introduce nonlinearity in our
balance equation and lead to bistability. Relying on the link between structure
and dynamics, we propose a forest resilience indicator that could be used for
targeted conservation or restoration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14118v5
"Generative models-based data labeling for deep networks regression:
  application to seed maturity estimation from UAV multispectral images",2022-08-09T09:06:51Z,"Eric Dericquebourg, Adel Hafiane, Raphael Canals","Monitoring seed maturity is an increasing challenge in agriculture due to
climate change and more restrictive practices. Seeds monitoring in the field is
essential to optimize the farming process and to guarantee yield quality
through high germination. Traditional methods are based on limited sampling in
the field and analysis in laboratory. Moreover, they are time consuming and
only allow monitoring sub-sections of the crop field. This leads to a lack of
accuracy on the condition of the crop as a whole due to intra-field
heterogeneities. Multispectral imagery by UAV allows uniform scan of fields and
better capture of crop maturity information. On the other hand, deep learning
methods have shown tremendous potential in estimating agronomic parameters,
especially maturity. However, they require large labeled datasets. Although
large sets of aerial images are available, labeling them with ground truth is a
tedious, if not impossible task. In this paper, we propose a method for
estimating parsley seed maturity using multispectral UAV imagery, with a new
approach for automatic data labeling. This approach is based on parametric and
non-parametric models to provide weak labels. We also consider the data
acquisition protocol and the performance evaluation of the different steps of
the method. Results show good performance, and the non-parametric kernel
density estimator model can improve neural network generalization when used as
a labeling method, leading to more robust and better performing deep neural
models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04611v1
"Neural Networks for Extreme Quantile Regression with an Application to
  Forecasting of Flood Risk",2022-08-16T08:02:49Z,"Olivier C. Pasche, Sebastian Engelke","Risk assessment for extreme events requires accurate estimation of high
quantiles that go beyond the range of historical observations. When the risk
depends on the values of observed predictors, regression techniques are used to
interpolate in the predictor space. We propose the EQRN model that combines
tools from neural networks and extreme value theory into a method capable of
extrapolation in the presence of complex predictor dependence. Neural networks
can naturally incorporate additional structure in the data. We develop a
recurrent version of EQRN that is able to capture complex sequential dependence
in time series. We apply this method to forecast flood risk in the Swiss Aare
catchment. It exploits information from multiple covariates in space and time
to provide one-day-ahead predictions of return levels and exceedance
probabilities. This output complements the static return level from a
traditional extreme value analysis, and the predictions are able to adapt to
distributional shifts as experienced in a changing climate. Our model can help
authorities to manage flooding more effectively and to minimize their
disastrous impacts through early warning systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07590v4

  Fusion with Hausdorff--Gaussian Processes",2022-08-16T18:43:11Z,"Lucas da Cunha Godoy, Marcos Oliveira Prates, Jun Yan","Accurate modeling of spatial dependence is pivotal in analyzing spatial data,
influencing parameter estimation and out-of-sample predictions. The spatial
structure and geometry of the data significantly impact valid statistical
inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices,
struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes.
Conversely, data fusion models, while effective, rely on computationally
intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large
datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian
process (HGP), a versatile model class utilizing the Hausdorff distance to
capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We introduce a valid
correlation function within the HGP framework, accommodating diverse modeling
techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Integration into
generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability,
particularly in addressing change of support and data fusion challenges. We
validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application
to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating
its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is
competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction
performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for
modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications
spanning fields such as public health and climate science.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07900v2

radical transformation motivated by technological, environmental and

the introduction of low impact technologies in some countries are main factors
leading this transformation. Here we focus in particular on the introduction of
relatively small community energy systems based on solar energy that aim to
re-organize local energy systems to integrate distributed energy resources and
engage local communities. In each community, there is a set of producers and a
set of consumers (and a set of producers/consumers called prosumers). One of
the key aspects of the energetic communities is to maximise the energy that is
shared within the user. Thus, it is crucial to select the best
consumers/prosumers on the basis of their profile of consumption, in order to
minimize subsequent management of the energy once the community is built. Here

Total Solar Irradiance during the Last Five Centuries,2022-09-20T09:59:41Z,"V. Penza, F. Berrilli, L. Bertello, M. Cantoresi, S. Criscuoli, P. Giobbi","The total solar irradiance (TSI) varies on timescales of minute to centuries.
On short timescales it varies due to the superposition of intensity
fluctuations produced by turbulent convection and acoustic oscillations. On
longer scale times, it changes due to photospheric magnetic activity, mainly
because of the facular brightenings and dimmings caused by sunspots. While
modern TSI variations have been monitored from space since 1970s, TSI
variations over much longer periods can only be estimated using either
historical observations of magnetic features, possibly supported by flux
transport models, or from the measurements of the cosmogenic isotope (e.g.,
\textsuperscript{14}C or \textsuperscript{10}Be) concentrations in tree rings
and ice cores. The reconstruction of the TSI in the last few centuries,
particularly in the 17th/18th centuries during the Maunder minimum, is of
primary importance for studying climatic effects. To separate the temporal
components of the irradiance variations, specifically the magnetic cycle from
secular variability, we decomposed the signals associated with historical
observations of magnetic features and the solar modulation potential $\Phi$ by
applying an Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm. Thus, the reconstruction is
empirical and does not require any feature contrast or field transport model.
The assessed difference between the mean value during the Maunder minimum and
the present value is $\simeq2.5 Wm^{-2}$. Moreover it shows, in the first half
of the last century, a growth of $\simeq 1.5 W m^{-2}$ which stops around the
middle of the century to remain constant for the next 50 years, apart from the
modulation due to the solar cycle.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10115v1

significant time delay when transmitting the data back to Earth. It is
important to make accurate predictions for meteorological satellite images,
especially the nowcasting prediction up to 2 hours ahead. In recent years,
there has been growing interest in the research of nowcasting prediction
applications of weather radar images based on deep learning. Compared to the
weather radar images prediction problem, the main challenge for meteorological
satellite images prediction is the large-scale observation areas and therefore
the large sizes of the observation products. Here we present a deep
multi-scales extrapolation fusion method, to address the challenge of the
meteorological satellite images nowcasting prediction. First, we downsample the
original satellite images dataset with large size to several images datasets
with smaller resolutions, then we use a deep spatiotemporal sequences
prediction method to generate the multi-scales prediction images with different
resolutions separately. Second, we fuse the multi-scales prediction results to
the targeting prediction images with the original size by a conditional
generative adversarial network. The experiments based on the FY-4A
meteorological satellite data show that the proposed method can generate
realistic prediction images that effectively capture the evolutions of the
weather systems in detail. We believe that the general idea of this work can be
potentially applied to other spatiotemporal sequence prediction tasks with a
large size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11682v1
Comparative analysis of carbon cycle models via kinetic representations,2022-09-25T04:34:53Z,"Noel T. Fortun, Eduardo R. Mendoza","The pre-industrial state of the global carbon cycle is a significant aspect

representations, as uniform formalism, allow for a more extensive analysis and
comparison of the different models for the same system. Using the mathematical
theories of chemical reaction networks (with power-law kinetics), this work
extends the analysis of the kinetic representations of the two models and
assesses the similarities and differences in their structural and dynamic
properties in relation to model construction assumptions. The analysis includes
but is not limited to the coincidence of kinetic and stoichiometric spaces of
the networks, capacity for equilibria multiplicity and co-multiplicity, and
absolute concentration robustness in some species. Moreover, we bring together
previously published results about the power law kinetic representations of the
two models and consolidate them with new observations here. We also illustrate

long-term summer air temperature prediction. Specifically, the prediction of
average air temperature in the first and second August fortnights, using input
data from previous months, at two different locations, Paris (France) and
C\'ordoba (Spain), is considered. The target variable, mainly in the first
August fortnight, can contain signals of extreme events such as heatwaves, like

carried out this work is based on Reanalysis data, which are first processed by
a correlation analysis among different prediction variables and the target

Anatomy of Perturbed Traffic Networks during Urban Flooding,2022-10-02T01:24:19Z,"Akhil Anil Rajput, Sanjay Nayak, Shangjia Dong, Ali Mostafavi","Urban flooding disrupts traffic networks, affecting the mobility and
disrupting access of residents. Since flooding events are predicted to increase
due to climate change, and given the criticality of traffic networks,
understanding the flood-caused disruption of traffic networks is critical to
improve emergency planning and city resilience. Leveraging high-resolution
traffic network data from a major flood event and advanced high-order network
analysis, this study reveals characteristics of the anatomy of perturbed
traffic networks. First, the findings show network-wide persistent increased
travel times could last for weeks after flood water has receded, even after
modest flood failure. During disaster event period, modest flooding of 1.3%
road segments caused 8% temporal expansion of the entire traffic network. The
results also show distant trips would experience a greater percentage increase
in travel time. Also, the extent of increase in travel time does not decay with
distance from inundated areas, suggesting that the spatial reach of flood
impacts extends beyond flooded areas. Departing from the existing literature,
which primarily informs about physical vulnerability in road networks to
floods, the findings of this study provide important novel understanding of
floods impacts on the functioning of traffic networks in terms of travel time
and traffic network geometry. The persistent travel time increase in the entire
network can translate to significant social and economic impacts in terms of
user costs, additional CO2 emissions, and lost productivity. Due to the
importance of traffic networks functioning for the operation of cities, the
results have significance implications for city managers, transportation

Rate-Induced Tipping to Metastable Zombie Fires,2022-10-05T16:39:32Z,"Eoin O'Sullivan, Kieran Mulchrone, Sebastian Wieczorek","Zombie fires in peatlands disappear from the surface, smoulder underground
during the winter, and `come back to life' in the spring. They can release
hundreds of megatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere per year and are believed
to be caused by surface wildfires. Here, we propose rate-induced tipping
(R-tipping) to a subsurface hot metastable state in bioactive peat soils as a
main cause of Zombie fires. Our hypothesis is based on a conceptual soil-carbon
model subjected to realistic changes in weather and climate patterns, including
global warming scenarios and summer heatwaves.
  Mathematically speaking, R-tipping to the hot metastable state is a
nonautonomous instability, due to crossing an elusive quasithreshold, in a
multiple-timescale dynamical system. To explain this instability, we provide a
framework combining a special compactification technique with concepts from
geometric singular perturbation theory. This framework allows us to reduce an
R-tipping problem due to crossing a quasithreshold to a heteroclinic orbit
problem in a singular limit. We identify generic cases of tracking-tipping
transitions via: (i) unfolding of a codimension-two heteroclinic folded
saddle-node type-I singularity for global warming, and (ii) analysis of a
codimension-one saddle-to-saddle hetroclinic orbit for summer heatwaves, in
turn revealing new types of excitability quasithresholds.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02376v4

the scientific understanding of coastal processes, hazards and responses to

representations of tidal rivers limit the performance of such models at
resolving the complex flow dynamics especially near the river-ocean interface,
resulting in inaccurate simulations of flood inundation. In this research, we
propose a machine learning (ML) framework based on the state-of-the-art
physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the downscaled flow at the
subgrid scale. First, we demonstrate that PINN is able to assimilate
observations of various types and solve the one-dimensional (1-D) Saint-Venant
equations (SVE) directly. We perform the flow simulations over a floodplain and
along an open channel in several synthetic case studies. The PINN performance
is evaluated against analytical solutions and numerical models. Our results
indicate that the PINN solutions of water depth have satisfactory accuracy with
limited observations assimilated. In the case of flood wave propagation induced
by storm surge and tide, a new neural network architecture is proposed based on
Fourier feature embeddings that seamlessly encodes the periodic tidal boundary
condition in the PINN's formulation. Furthermore, we show that the PINN-based
downscaling can produce more reasonable subgrid solutions of the along-channel
water depth by assimilating observational data. The PINN solution outperforms
the simple linear interpolation in resolving the topography and dynamic flow
regimes at the subgrid scale. This study provides a promising path towards
improving emulation capabilities in large-scale models to characterize

yield and to support health of our growing population cannot be understated.
But to develop new products or refine existing ones in response to climate and
environmental changes is both time-intensive and expensive which is why the
agrochemical industry is increasingly interested in using mechanistic models as
part of their formulation development toolbox. In this work, we develop such a
model to describe uptake of pesticide spray droplets across the leaf surface.
We simplify the leaf structure by identifying the outer cuticle as the main
barrier to uptake; the result is a novel, hybrid model in which two well-mixed
compartments are separated by a membrane in which we describe the
spatio-temporal distribution of the pesticide. This leads to a boundary value
partial differential equation problem coupled to a pair of ordinary
differential equation systems which we solve numerically. We also simplify the
pesticide formulation into two key components: the Active Ingredient which
produces the desired effect of the pesticide and an Adjuvant which is present
in the formulation to facilitate effective absorption of the Active Ingredient
into the leaf. This approach gives rise to concentration-dependent diffusion.
We take an intuitive approach to parameter estimation using a small
experimental data set and subsequently demonstrate the importance of the
concentration-dependent diffusion in replicating the data. Finally, we
demonstrate the need for further work to identify how the physicochemical

planting and harvesting could benefit many industries, especially as the global
climate changes and traditional methods become less accurate. Recent work using
machine learning (ML) to predict yields for alfalfa and other crops has shown
promise. Previous efforts used remote sensing, weather, planting, and soil data
to train machine learning models for yield prediction. However, while remote
sensing works well, the models require large amounts of data and cannot make
predictions until the harvesting season begins. Using weather and planting data
from alfalfa variety trials in Kentucky and Georgia, our previous work compared
feature selection techniques to find the best technique and best feature set.
In this work, we trained a variety of machine learning models, using cross
validation for hyperparameter optimization, to predict biomass yields, and we
showed better accuracy than similar work that employed more complex techniques.
Our best individual model was a random forest with a mean absolute error of
0.081 tons/acre and R{$^2$} of 0.941. Next, we expanded this dataset to include
Wisconsin and Mississippi, and we repeated our experiments, obtaining a higher
best R{$^2$} of 0.982 with a regression tree. We then isolated our testing

tool to observe the Earth's surface, detect the climatic changes and many other
applications. The classification of HSI is one of the most challenging tasks
due to the large amount of spectral information and the presence of redundant
and irrelevant bands. Although great progresses have been made on
classification techniques, few studies have been done to provide practical
guidelines to determine the appropriate classifier for HSI. In this paper, we
investigate the performance of four supervised learning algorithms, namely,
Support Vector Machines SVM, Random Forest RF, K-Nearest Neighbors KNN and
Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA with different kernels in terms of
classification accuracies. The experiments have been performed on three real
hyperspectral datasets taken from the NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
Spectrometer Sensor AVIRIS and the Reflective Optics System Imaging
Spectrometer ROSIS sensors. The mutual information had been used to reduce the
dimensionality of the used datasets for better classification efficiency. The
extensive experiments demonstrate that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel and
RF produced statistically better results and seems to be respectively the more
suitable as supervised classifiers for the hyperspectral remote sensing images.

rapidly growing concern and robust, real-time air-quality monitoring and
forecasting plays a critical role in allowing effective policy formulation and
implementation. This paper presents DELFI, a novel deep learning-based mixture
model to make effective long-term predictions of Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5

forecasting problem. The observation that point predictions are more suitable
in the short-term and probabilistic predictions in the long-term allows
accurate predictions to be made as much as 24 hours in advance. DELFI
incorporates meteorological data as well as pollutant-based features to ensure
a robust model that is divided into two parts: (i) a stack of three Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that perform differential modelling of the
same window of past data, and (ii) a fully-connected layer enabling attention
to each of the components. Experimental evaluation based on deployment of 13
stations in the Delhi National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) in India establishes
that DELFI offers far superior predictions especially in the long-term as
compared to even non-parametric baselines. The Delhi-NCR recorded the 3rd
highest PM levels amongst 39 mega-cities across the world during 2011-2015 and

  the mobility of Engineered Nano-particles in a contaminated aquifer",2022-10-25T07:55:20Z,"Shikhar Nilabh, Fidel Grandia","Numerous polluted groundwater sites across the globe require an active
remediation strategy to restore natural environmental conditions and local
ecosystem. The Engineered Nano-particles (ENPs) have emerged as an efficient
reactive agent for the in-situ degradation of groundwater contaminants. While
the performance of these ENPs has been highly promising on the laboratory
scale, their application in real field case conditions is still limited. The
complex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an
efficient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding
the transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required. The existing
tools in the literature are dominated with numerical simulators, which have
limited flexibility and accuracy in the presence of sparse datasets. This work
uses a dynamic, weight-enabled Physics-Informed Neural Network (dw-PINN)

from the forward model demonstrates the effective capability of dw-PINN in
accurately predicting the ENPs mobility. The model verification step shows that
the relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concentration using
dw-PINN converges to a minimum value of $1.3{e^{-5}}$. In the subsequent step,
the result from the inverse model estimates the governing parameters of ENPs

hinted at periodic behavior that was non-seasonal, as well as dynamical
relationships between tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures. However,
these observations were made over time frames shorter than Jupiter's orbit or
they used sparse sampling. We derived upper-tropospheric (300-mbar)
temperatures over 40 years, extending those studies to cover several orbits of
Jupiter, revealing unexpected results. Periodicities of 4, 7 8-9 and 10-14

disconnected from seasonal changes in solar heating. Anti-correlations of
variability in opposite hemispheres were particularly striking at 16, 22 and 30
degrees from the equator. Equatorial temperature variations are also
anticorrelated with those 60-70 km above. Such behavior suggests a top-down

equations (RDEs) in one spatial dimension, where the reaction term decays in
space (asymptotically homogeneous) and varies linearly with time
(nonautonomous) due to an external input. A compactification of the
moving-frame coordinate together with Lin's method to construct heteroclinic
orbits along intersections of stable and unstable invariant manifolds allows us
to (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by
computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive
infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii)
detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits,
and (iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such
bifurcations. We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat
patch that features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically
shrinking or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we
identify two classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced
tipping (B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length
and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some
critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how
the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal
rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population
survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite
homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with
gradual transitions to extinction found for logistic population growth without

battery degradation have mostly concentrated on modeling degradation through
one scalar measurement summarizing each VDC. Such simplification of curves can
lead to inaccurate predictive models. Here we analyze the degradation of
rechargeable Li-ion batteries from a NASA data set through modeling and

we integrate these predictions to perform a degradation analysis. Our approach
is fully functional, allows the incorporation of usage information, produces

previous deep learning approaches duplicate static variables along the time

interconnections between the branches during the feature learning stage. To
address these issues, this paper proposes a 2D/3D two-branch convolutional

However, the variability of wind energy causes wind curtailment, resulting in
considerable economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind curtailment can be
reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as onsite backup sources.
Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly weaken the economic potential of
BESS in energy trading. Ideal BESS scheduling should balance onsite wind

challenging due to coordination complexity and the stochastic nature of energy
prices and wind generation. We investigate the joint-market bidding strategy of
a co-located wind-battery system in the spot and Regulation Frequency Control

approach that decouples the system's market participation into two related
Markov decision processes for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite
wind curtailment while performing joint-market bidding to maximize overall
operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we validated the
coordinated bidding strategy, with outcomes surpassing the optimization-based
benchmark in terms of higher revenue by approximately 25\% and more wind
curtailment reduction by 2.3 times. Our results show that joint-market bidding
can significantly improve the financial performance of wind-battery systems

reliable communication between robot and user. Moreover, a single wireless
solution does not exist for the agricultural domain, but instead multiple
solutions can be combined to meet the necessary telecommunications

"Bidirectional coupling of a long-term integrated assessment model REMIND
  v3.0.0 with an hourly power sector model DIETER v1.0.2",2022-09-06T09:59:14Z,"Chen Chris Gong, Falko Ueckerdt, Robert Pietzcker, Adrian Odenweller, Wolf-Peter Schill, Martin Kittel, Gunnar Luderer","Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are a central tool for the quantitative
analysis of climate change mitigation strategies. However, due to their global,
cross-sectoral and centennial scope, IAMs cannot explicitly represent the
spatio-temporal detail required to properly analyze the key role of variable
renewable electricity (VRE) for decarbonizing the power sector and end-use
electrification. In contrast, power sector models (PSMs) incorporate high
spatio-temporal resolutions, but tend to have narrower scopes and shorter time
horizons. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel methodology: an
iterative and fully automated soft-coupling framework that combines the
strengths of a IAM and a PSM. This framework uses the market values of power
generation as well as the capture prices of demand in the PSM as price signals
that change the capacity and power mix of the IAM. Hence, both models make
endogenous investment decisions, leading to a joint solution. We apply the
method to Germany in a proof-of-concept study using the IAM REMIND and the PSM
DIETER, and confirm the theoretical prediction of almost-full convergence both
in terms of decision variables and (shadow) prices. At the end of the iterative
process, the absolute model difference between the generation shares of any
generator type for any year is <5% for a simple configuration (no storage, no
flexible demand), and 6-7% for a more realistic and detailed configuration
(with storage and flexible demand). For the simple configuration, we
mathematically show that this coupling scheme corresponds uniquely to an
iterative mapping of the Lagrangians of two power sector optimization problems
of different time resolutions, which can lead to a comprehensive model
convergence of both decision variables and (shadow) prices. Since our approach
is based on fundamental economic principles, it is applicable also to other
IAM-PSM pairs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02340v3
Optimal plug-in Gaussian processes for modelling derivatives,2022-10-20T22:42:55Z,"Zejian Liu, Meng Li","Derivatives are a key nonparametric functional in wide-ranging applications
where the rate of change of an unknown function is of interest. In the Bayesian
paradigm, Gaussian processes (GPs) are routinely used as a flexible prior for
unknown functions, and are arguably one of the most popular tools in many
areas. However, little is known about the optimal modelling strategy and
theoretical properties when using GPs for derivatives. In this article, we
study a plug-in strategy by differentiating the posterior distribution with GP
priors for derivatives of any order. This practically appealing plug-in GP
method has been previously perceived as suboptimal and degraded, but this is
not necessarily the case. We provide posterior contraction rates for plug-in
GPs and establish that they remarkably adapt to derivative orders. We show that
the posterior measure of the regression function and its derivatives, with the
same choice of hyperparameter that does not depend on the order of derivatives,
converges at the minimax optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor for functions
in certain classes. We analyze a data-driven hyperparameter tuning method based
on empirical Bayes, and show that it satisfies the optimal rate condition while
maintaining computational efficiency. This article to the best of our knowledge
provides the first positive result for plug-in GPs in the context of inferring
derivative functionals, and leads to a practically simple nonparametric
Bayesian method with optimal and adaptive hyperparameter tuning for
simultaneously estimating the regression function and its derivatives.
Simulations show competitive finite sample performance of the plug-in GP
method. A climate change application for analyzing the global sea-level rise is
discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11626v2
Predicting air quality via multimodal AI and satellite imagery,2022-11-01T22:56:15Z,"Andrew Rowley, Oktay Karakuş","Climate change may be classified as the most important environmental problem
that the Earth is currently facing, and affects all living species on Earth.
Given that air-quality monitoring stations are typically ground-based their
abilities to detect pollutant distributions are often restricted to wide areas.
Satellites however have the potential for studying the atmosphere at large; the
European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus project satellite, ""Sentinel-5P"" is a
newly launched satellite capable of measuring a variety of pollutant
information with publicly available data outputs. This paper seeks to create a
multi-modal machine learning model for predicting air-quality metrics where
monitoring stations do not exist. The inputs of this model will include a
fusion of ground measurements and satellite data with the goal of highlighting
pollutant distribution and motivating change in societal and industrial
behaviors. A new dataset of European pollution monitoring station measurements
is created with features including $\textit{altitude, population, etc.}$ from
the ESA Copernicus project. This dataset is used to train a multi-modal ML
model, Air Quality Network (AQNet) capable of fusing these various types of
data sources to output predictions of various pollutants. These predictions are
then aggregated to create an ""air-quality index"" that could be used to compare
air quality over different regions. Three pollutants, NO$_2$, O$_3$, and
PM$_{10}$, are predicted successfully by AQNet and the network was found to be
useful compared to a model only using satellite imagery. It was also found that
the addition of supporting data improves predictions. When testing the
developed AQNet on out-of-sample data of the UK and Ireland, we obtain
satisfactory estimates though on average pollution metrics were roughly
overestimated by around 20\%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00780v2

  Cattle",2022-01-07T20:50:09Z,"S. L. Cartwright, J Schmied, A Livernois, B. A. Mallard","The frequency of heat waves are increasing due to climate change, which leads
to an increase in the occurrence of heat stress in dairy cattle. Previous
studies have shown that dairy cattle identified as high immune responders have
a reduced incidence of disease and improved vaccine response compared to
average and low responders. Additionally, it has been observed that when cells
from immune phenotyped cattle are exposed to in-vitro heat challenge, high
immune responders exhibit increased heat tolerance compared to average and low
responders. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate
physiological parameters and the function of blood mononuclear cells in immune
phenotyped dairy cattle exposed to in-vivo heat challenge. A total of 24 immune
phenotyped lactating dairy cattle (8 high, 8 average and 8 low) were housed in
the tie-stall area of the barn and exposed to an in-vivo heat challenge for 4
hours on 2 subsequent days. Blood samples were taken both pre- and
post-challenge and respiration rates and rectal temperatures were recorded.
Temperature and humidity measurements were taken in correspondence with all
respiration rate and rectal temperature measurements to calculate the
temperature humidity index. Blood mononuclear cells were isolated from blood
collected pre and post challenge and the concentration of heat shock protein 70
and cell proliferation were assessed. Results showed that average and low
responders had significantly greater respiration rates compared to high
responders at a temperature humidity index of 77 and above. High responders had
a higher heat shock protein 70 concentration and greater cell proliferation
after in-vivo heat challenge compared to average and low responders. These
results paralleled those found during in-vitro heat challenge confirming that
high responders may be more resilient to heat stress compared average and low

Looking out for a sustainable space,2022-02-14T19:21:18Z,James A. Blake,"October 1957, and the successful launch of Sputnik 1 into Earth orbit, marked
the dawn of the Space Age. The first of the 'fellow travellers' - humanity's
first artificial satellite - orbited for a mere three months before re-entering

exploration that has endured to the present day. For many, a world without
satellites would be a difficult one to imagine. As a society, we have become
reliant on them for a vast array of services and applications. With a divine
view of large swathes of the Earth's surface, and the ability to relay signals
around its curvature, satellites have enabled the fast transfer of data on a
global scale, bypassing the challenges associated with ground-based
broadcasting, long-distance wiring, and so on. Positioning, Navigation and
Timing (PNT) satellites have revolutionised transportation by land, air, and
sea, while weather satellites enable scientists to monitor and warn of
large-scale phenomena as they develop in near real-time. Satellites have
extended the frontiers of observation: looking outwards, astronomers are able
to circumvent the Earth's atmosphere to look deeper into the cosmos than ever
before; looking inwards, patterns and processes that feed into general
circulation models can be monitored on a range of timescales, improving our
understanding of climate change. Satellites, and the services they provide, are
not going to disappear any time soon. That said, threats to satellite safety do
exist, and it is important that they be addressed as soon as possible to avoid

  potential through carbon mineralization",2022-03-25T20:10:08Z,"Lindsey J. Heagy, Thibaut Astic, Joseph Capriotti, John Weis, Douglas W. Oldenburg","In addition to reducing anthropogenic emissions of CO$_2$, it is increasingly
clear we also need to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere in order to avoid some
of the worst case scenarios for climate change. Geologic sequestration of
CO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the large global
capacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is
through carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals
that will react with CO$_2$ in a carbonation reaction and convert it to
carbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent CO$_2$ storage mechanism.
The geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and
estimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that
emulates a prospective site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we
simulate and invert gravity and magnetic data to delineate reactive rocks. We
begin by inverting each data set independently and introduce a proxy experiment
to contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate
physical-property threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We
use this proxy experiment to estimate thresholds for standard, $\ell_2$
inversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions which use
sparse and compact norms. A Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Inversion
(PGI) framework is used to construct quasi-geologic models from which volumes
can be estimated directly. We apply the PGI framework to the magnetics and
gravity data independently. The framework is also used to jointly invert these
data and produce a model that is consistent with both data sets. Cumulative
volume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ
or ex situ sequestration might be appropriate. Using each of the inverted
models, we estimate cumulative volume of reactive rock as a function of depth.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13894v1
The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf: Case Studies of Peer Review,2022-03-31T15:11:29Z,Eve Armstrong,"I present for your appraisal three independent cases of the manuscript
referee process conducted by a venerable peer-reviewed scientific journal. Each
case involves a little pig, who submitted for consideration a theoretical plan
for a house to be constructed presently, in a faraway land. An anonymous big
bad wolf was assigned by the journal to assess the merit of these manuscripts.
The pigs proposed three distinct construction frameworks, which varied in
physical and mathematical sophistication. The first little pig submitted a
model of straw, based on the numerical method of toe-counting. His design
included odd features, such as spilled millet and cloven-hoofprints on the
window sill -- possibly a ploy to distract the wolf from the manuscript's
facile mathematical foundation. The second little pig used a more advanced
approach, employing Newton's classical laws of motion, to propose a house of
sticks. This pig included in her manuscript copious citations by a specific
wolf, possibly aiming to ensure acceptance by flattering the wolf whom she
anticipated would be the referee. The third little pig described an
ostentatious house of bricks based on an elaborate dynamical systems and
stability analysis, possibly scheming to dazzle and impress. The big bad wolf
did not appear moved by any of the pigs' tactics. His recommendations were, for
straw: the minor revision of water-proofing; for sticks: the major revision of
fire-proofing, given concerns surrounding climate change; for bricks:
unequivocal rejection, accompanied by multiple derogatory comments regarding
""high-and-mighty theorists."" I describe each case in detail, and suggest that
the wolf's reports might be driven as much by self interest as the manuscripts
themselves -- namely, that at the time the wolf wrote the reviews, he was
rather hungry. Finally, I examine morals learned, if any.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17095v1

human living environments. Therefore, forest biomass estimation methods are
necessary to monitor changes in the forest structure and function, which are
key data in natural resources research. Although accurate forest biomass
measurements are important in forest inventory and assessments, high-density
measurements that involve airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) at a low
flight height in large mountainous areas are highly expensive. The objective of
this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a plateau
mountainous forest reserve using a system that synergistically combines an
unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based digital aerial camera and LiDAR to
leverage their complementary advantages. In this study, we utilized digital
aerial photogrammetry (DAP), which has the unique advantages of speed, high
spatial resolution, and low cost, to compensate for the deficiency of forestry
inventory using UAS-based LiDAR that requires terrain-following flight for
high-resolution data acquisition. Combined with the sparse LiDAR points
acquired by using a high-altitude and high-speed UAS for terrain extraction,
dense normalized DAP point clouds can be obtained to produce an accurate and
high-resolution canopy height model (CHM). Based on the CHM and spectral
attributes obtained from multispectral images, we estimated and mapped the AGB
of the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency. Our study supports
the development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping
by leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work

rolling out EV-favourable policies, and major car manufacturers are committing
to fully electrifying their offerings over the coming decades. With the number
of EVs on the roads expected to increase, it is imperative to understand the
effect of EVs on transport and energy systems. While unmanaged charging of EVs

grid and their potential use as batteries-on-wheels through smart charging
capabilities, decision-makers need to understand how current EV owners drive
and charge their vehicles. As such, an emerging area of research focuses on
understanding these behaviours. Some studies have used stated preference
surveys of non-EV owners or data collected from EV trials to estimate EV
driving and charging patterns. Other studies have tried to decipher EV owners'
behaviour based on data collected from national surveys or as reported by EV

prediction (NWP) have been measured by the improvement of forecasts for various
physical fields such as temperature and pressure; however, large biases exist

CFSv2 with deep learning to create a hybrid model that improves short-range
global precipitation at 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead times. To hybridise, we address
the sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which
transforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. Dynamical model
precipitation and surface temperature outputs are fed into a modified DLWP-CS
(UNET) to forecast ground truth precipitation. While CFSv2's average bias is +5
to +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model decreases it to
within -1 to +1 mm/day. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004,
China floods in 2010, India floods in 2005, and Myanmar storm Nargis in 2008
are used to confirm the substantial enhancement in the skill for the hybrid
dynamical-deep learning model. CFSv2 typically shows a moderate to large bias
in the spatial pattern and overestimates the precipitation at short-range time
scales. The proposed deep learning augmented NWP model can address these biases
and vastly improve the spatial pattern and magnitude of predicted

specific hardware (e.g., Google Coral Edge TPU). With the growing demand for
quantization, ensuring the reliability of this strategy is becoming a critical
challenge. Traditional testing methods, which gather more and more genuine data
for better assessment, are often not practical because of the large size of the
input space and the high similarity between the original DNN and its quantized

opinion ecosystem to boost certain opinions. To evaluate the effectiveness of
positive interventions, we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM), a two-tier
online opinion ecosystem model that considers both inter-opinion interactions
and the role of positive interventions. The size of the opinion attention
market is modeled in the first tier using the multivariate discrete-time Hawkes
process; in the second tier, opinions cooperate and compete for market share,
given limited attention using the market share attraction model. We demonstrate
the convergence of our proposed estimation scheme on a synthetic dataset. Next,
we test OMM on two learning tasks, applying to two real-world datasets to
predict attention market shares and uncover latent relationships between online
items. The first dataset comprises Facebook and Twitter discussions containing
moderate and far-right opinions about bushfires and climate change. The second
dataset captures popular VEVO artists' YouTube and Twitter attention volumes.
OMM outperforms the state-of-the-art predictive models on both datasets and
captures latent cooperation-competition relations. We uncover (1) self- and
cross-reinforcement between far-right and moderate opinions on the bushfires

critical conditions of high demand and low wind energy supply must be
considered in the design of energy systems. We describe a methodology for
modeling joint distributions of meteorological variables without making any

copulas are used to model the correlated nature of cold and weak-wind events.
The marginal distributions are modeled with logistic regressions defining two

automation, sample preparation is still carried out manually due to the high
level of motor function and dexterity required when dealing with different
tools, chemicals, and glassware. A fundamental workflow in chemical fields is
crystallisation, where one application is polymorph screening, i.e., obtaining
a three dimensional molecular structure from a crystal. For this process, it is
of utmost importance to recover as much of the sample as possible since
synthesising molecules is both costly in time and money. To this aim, chemists
scrape vials to retrieve sample contents prior to imaging plate transfer.
Automating this process is challenging as it goes beyond robotic insertion
tasks due to a fundamental requirement of having to execute fine-granular
movements within a constrained environment (sample vial). Motivated by how
human chemists carry out this process of scraping powder from vials, our work
proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method for learning a scraping
policy, leading to a fully autonomous sample scraping procedure. We first
create a scenario-specific simulation environment with a Panda Franka Emika

Toward Human-AI Co-creation to Accelerate Material Discovery,2022-11-05T17:48:59Z,"Dmitry Zubarev, Carlos Raoni Mendes, Emilio Vital Brazil, Renato Cerqueira, Kristin Schmidt, Vinicius Segura, Juliana Jansen Ferreira, Dan Sanders","There is an increasing need in our society to achieve faster advances in
Science to tackle urgent problems, such as climate changes, environmental
hazards, sustainable energy systems, pandemics, among others. In certain
domains like chemistry, scientific discovery carries the extra burden of
assessing risks of the proposed novel solutions before moving to the
experimental stage. Despite several recent advances in Machine Learning and AI
to address some of these challenges, there is still a gap in technologies to
support end-to-end discovery applications, integrating the myriad of available
technologies into a coherent, orchestrated, yet flexible discovery process.
Such applications need to handle complex knowledge management at scale,
enabling knowledge consumption and production in a timely and efficient way for
subject matter experts (SMEs). Furthermore, the discovery of novel functional
materials strongly relies on the development of exploration strategies in the
chemical space. For instance, generative models have gained attention within
the scientific community due to their ability to generate enormous volumes of
novel molecules across material domains. These models exhibit extreme
creativity that often translates in low viability of the generated candidates.
In this work, we propose a workbench framework that aims at enabling the
human-AI co-creation to reduce the time until the first discovery and the
opportunity costs involved. This framework relies on a knowledge base with
domain and process knowledge, and user-interaction components to acquire
knowledge and advise the SMEs. Currently,the framework supports four main
activities: generative modeling, dataset triage, molecule adjudication, and
risk assessment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04257v1

nomadic communities, and are likely to lead to increased migratory movements in
coming years. As a result, mobility considerations are becoming increasingly
important in energy systems planning, particularly to achieve energy access in
developing countries. Advanced Plug and Play control strategies have been
recently developed with such a decentralized framework in mind, more easily
allowing for the interconnection of nomadic communities, both to each other and
to the main grid. In light of the above, the design and planning strategy of a
mobile multi-energy supply system for a nomadic community is investigated in
this work. Motivated by the scale and dimensionality of the associated
uncertainties, impacting all major design and decision variables over the
30-year planning horizon, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is implemented for
the design and planning problem tackled. DRL based solutions are benchmarked
against several rigid baseline design options to compare expected performance
under uncertainty. The results on a case study for ger communities in Mongolia
suggest that mobile nomadic energy systems can be both technically and
economically feasible, particularly when considering flexibility, although the
degree of spatial dispersion among households is an important limiting factor.
Key economic, sustainability and resilience indicators such as Cost, Equivalent
Emissions and Total Unmet Load are measured, suggesting potential improvements
compared to available baselines of up to 25%, 67% and 76%, respectively.
Finally, the decomposition of values of flexibility and plug and play operation

  from Multispectral and Panchromatic Commercial Satellite Imagery",2022-12-27T20:56:34Z,"Joachim Moortgat, Ziwei Li, Michael Durand, Ian Howat, Bidhyananda Yadav, Chunli Dai","Remote sensing of the Earth's surface water is critical in a wide range of
environmental studies, from evaluating the societal impacts of seasonal
droughts and floods to the large-scale implications of climate change.
Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from
satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by 1) the spatial
resolution of public satellite imagery, 2) classification schemes that operate
at the pixel level, and 3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the
state-of-the-art by 1) using commercial imagery with panchromatic and
multispectral resolutions of 30 cm and 1.2 m, respectively, 2) developing
multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the
morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral
properties, and 3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery.
This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird,
WorldView, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at
such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the RGB, and
NIR bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve
excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly
preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel
approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training
data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more
is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a
precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained
model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide

  urgent workloads",2022-12-28T17:56:47Z,"Nick Brown, Simon Newby","Urgent computing workloads are time critical, unpredictable, and highly
dynamic. Whilst efforts are on-going to run these on traditional HPC machines,
another option is to leverage the computing power donated by volunteers.
Volunteer computing, where members of the public donate some of their CPU time
to large scale projects has been popular for many years because it is a
powerful way of delivering compute for specific problems, with the public often
eager to contribute to a good cause with societal benefits. However,
traditional volunteer computing has required user installation of specialist
software which is a barrier to entry, and the development of the software
itself by the projects, even on-top of existing frameworks, is non-trivial.
  As such, the number of users donating CPU time to these volunteer computing
projects has decreased in recent years, and this comes at a time when the
frequency of disasters, often driven by climate change, are rising fast. We
believe that an alternative approach, where visitors to websites donate some of
their CPU time whilst they are browsing, has the potential to address these
issues. However, web-based distributed computing is an immature field and there
are numerous questions that must be answered to fully understand the viability
of leveraging the large scale parallelism that website visitors represent. In
this paper we describe our web-based distributed computing framework, Panther,
and perform in-depth performance experiments for two benchmarks using real
world hardware and real world browsing habits for the first time. By exploring
the performance characteristics of our approach we demonstrate that this is
viable for urgent workloads, but there are numerous caveats, not least the most
appropriate visitor patterns to a website, that must be considered.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13981v1

discretionary lane-changing vehicle groups constitute a consecutive

Learning Sinkhorn divergences for supervised change point detection,2022-02-08T17:11:40Z,"Nauman Ahad, Eva L. Dyer, Keith B. Hengen, Yao Xie, Mark A. Davenport","Many modern applications require detecting change points in complex

for learning a ground metric such that Sinkhorn divergences can be then used in
two-sample tests on sliding windows to detect change points in an online
manner. Our method can be used to learn a sparse metric which can be useful for

A Change Dynamic Model for the Online Detection of Gradual Change,2022-05-02T17:38:24Z,Chris Browne,"Changes in the statistical properties of a stochastic process are typically
assumed to occur via change-points, which demark instantaneous moments of
complete and total change in process behavior. In cases where these transitions
occur gradually, this assumption can result in a reduced ability to properly
identify and respond to process change. With this observation in mind, we
introduce a novel change-dynamic model for the online detection of gradual
change in a Bayesian framework, in which change-points are used within a
hierarchical model to indicate moments of gradual change onset or termination.
We apply this model to synthetic data and EEG readings drawn during epileptic
seizure, where we find our change-dynamic model can enable faster and more
accurate identification of gradual change than traditional change-point models
allow.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01054v3

Data-Adaptive Symmetric CUSUM for Sequential Change Detection,2022-10-31T14:27:42Z,"Nauman Ahad, Mark A. Davenport, Yao Xie","Detecting change points sequentially in a streaming setting, especially when
both the mean and the variance of the signal can change, is often a challenging
task. A key difficulty in this context often involves setting an appropriate
detection threshold, which for many standard change statistics may need to be
tuned depending on the pre-change and post-change distributions. This presents
a challenge in a sequential change detection setting when a signal switches
between multiple distributions. For example, consider a signal where change
points are indicated by increases/decreases in the mean and variance of the
signal. In this context, we would like to be able to compare our change
statistic to a fixed threshold that will be symmetric to either increases or
decreases in the mean and variance. Unfortunately, change point detection
schemes that use the log-likelihood ratio, such as CUSUM and GLR, are quick to
react to changes but are not symmetric when both the mean and the variance of
the signal change. This makes it difficult to set a single threshold to detect
multiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We propose a
modified version of CUSUM that we call Data-Adaptive Symmetric CUSUM
(DAS-CUSUM). The DAS-CUSUM change point detection procedure is symmetric for
changes between distributions, making it suitable to set a single threshold to
detect multiple change points sequentially in a streaming setting. We provide
results that relate to the expected detection delay and average run length for
our proposed procedure. Extensive simulations are used to validate these
results. Experiments on real-world data further show the utility of using
DAS-CUSUM over both CUSUM and GLR.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17353v1

Sequential Change Diagnosis Revisited and the Adaptive Matrix CuSum,2022-11-23T14:39:58Z,"Austin Warner, Georgios Fellouris","The problem of sequential change diagnosis is considered, where observations
are obtained on-line, an abrupt change occurs in their distribution, and the
goal is to quickly detect the change and accurately identify the post-change
distribution, while controlling the false alarm rate. A finite set of
alternatives is postulated for the post-change regime, but no prior information
is assumed for the unknown change-point. A drawback of many algorithms that
have been proposed for this problem is the implicit use of pre-change data for
determining the post-change distribution. This can lead to very large
conditional probabilities of misidentification, given that there was no false
alarm, unless the change occurs soon after monitoring begins. A novel,
recursive algorithm is proposed and shown to resolve this issue without the use
of additional tuning parameters and without sacrificing control of the
worst-case delay in Lorden's sense. A theoretical analysis is conducted for a

to detect change of mean and variance from low to high-dimensional online data
with a variable scanning window. Inspired by complete graph structure, we
introduce graph-spanning ratios to map high-dimensional data into metrics, and
then test statistically if a change of mean or change of variance occurs.
Theoretical study shows that our approach has the desirable pivotal property
and is powerful with prescribed error probabilities. We demonstrate that this
framework outperforms other methods in terms of detection power. Our approach
has high detection power with small and multiple scanning window, which allows

changes in its environment or for fine-tuning. For instance, a system
administrator may change a few entities/attributes in the configuration to
improve error recovery and system availability. However, these changes focusing
on fine-tuning availability may violate some global system constraints captured

properties and operations. This is generally due to the partialness of the
changes performed by the administrator who is not aware of all the
entities/attributes being in relations with the modified entities/attributes.
In this paper, we propose an approach for completing such partial sets of

"Detecting Abrupt Changes in Channel Covariance Matrix for MIMO
  Communication",2022-07-05T12:04:12Z,"Runnan Liu, Liang Liu, Dazhi He, Wenjun Zhang, Erik G. Larsson","The acquisition of the channel covariance matrix is of paramount importance
to many strategies in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications,
such as the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation. Therefore,
plenty of efficient channel covariance matrix estimation schemes have been
proposed in the literature. However, an abrupt change in the channel covariance
matrix may happen occasionally in practice due to the change in the scattering
environment and the user location. Our paper aims to adopt the classic change
detection theory to detect the change in the channel covariance matrix as
accurately and quickly as possible such that the new covariance matrix can be
re-estimated in time. Specifically, this paper first considers the technique of
on-line change detection (also known as quickest/sequential change detection),
where we need to detect whether a change in the channel covariance matrix
occurs at each channel coherence time interval. Next, because the complexity of
detecting the change in a high-dimension covariance matrix at each coherence
time interval is too high, we devise a low-complexity off-line strategy in
massive MIMO systems, where change detection is merely performed at the last
channel coherence time interval of a given time period. Numerical results show
that our proposed on-line and off-line schemes can detect the channel
covariance change with a small delay and a low false alarm rate. Therefore, our
paper theoretically and numerically verifies the feasibility of detecting the
channel covariance change accurately and quickly in practice.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01984v2
How Stable is Knowledge Base Knowledge?,2022-11-02T09:50:23Z,"Suhas Shrinivasan, Simon Razniewski","Knowledge Bases (KBs) provide structured representation of the real-world in
the form of extensive collections of facts about real-world entities, their
properties and relationships. They are ubiquitous in large-scale intelligent
systems that exploit structured information such as in tasks like structured
search, question answering and reasoning, and hence their data quality becomes
paramount. The inevitability of change in the real-world, brings us to a
central property of KBs -- they are highly dynamic in that the information they
contain are constantly subject to change. In other words, KBs are unstable.
  In this paper, we investigate the notion of KB stability, specifically, the
problem of KBs changing due to real-world change. Some entity-property-pairs do
not undergo change in reality anymore (e.g., Einstein-children or
Tesla-founders), while others might well change in the future (e.g.,
Tesla-board member or Ronaldo-occupation as of 2022). This notion of real-world
grounded change is different from other changes that affect the data only,
notably correction and delayed insertion, which have received attention in data
cleaning, vandalism detection, and completeness estimation already. To analyze
KB stability, we proceed in three steps. (1) We present heuristics to delineate
changes due to world evolution from delayed completions and corrections, and
use these to study the real-world evolution behaviour of diverse Wikidata
domains, finding a high skew in terms of properties. (2) We evaluate heuristics
to identify entities and properties likely to not change due to real-world
change, and filter inherently stable entities and properties. (3) We evaluate
the possibility of predicting stability post-hoc, specifically predicting
change in a property of an entity, finding that this is possible with up to 83%
F1 score, on a balanced binary stability prediction task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00989v1

  Detect Semantic Change",2022-04-12T11:20:42Z,"Mario Giulianelli, Andrey Kutuzov, Lidia Pivovarova","Morphological and syntactic changes in word usage (as captured, e.g., by
grammatical profiles) have been shown to be good predictors of a word's meaning
change. In this work, we explore whether large pre-trained contextualised
language models, a common tool for lexical semantic change detection, are
sensitive to such morphosyntactic changes. To this end, we first compare the
performance of grammatical profiles against that of a multilingual neural
language model (XLM-R) on 10 datasets, covering 7 languages, and then combine
the two approaches in ensembles to assess their complementarity. Our results
show that ensembling grammatical profiles with XLM-R improves semantic change
detection performance for most datasets and languages. This indicates that
language models do not fully cover the fine-grained morphological and syntactic
signals that are explicitly represented in grammatical profiles.
  An interesting exception are the test sets where the time spans under
analysis are much longer than the time gap between them (for example,
century-long spans with a one-year gap between them). Morphosyntactic change is
slow so grammatical profiles do not detect in such cases. In contrast, language
models, thanks to their access to lexical information, are able to detect fast
topical changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05717v1
Building Change Detection using Multi-Temporal Airborne LiDAR Data,2022-04-26T18:43:29Z,"Ritu Yadav, Andrea Nascetti, Yifang Ban","Building change detection is essential for monitoring urbanization, disaster
assessment, urban planning and frequently updating the maps. 3D structure
information from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is very effective
for detecting urban changes. But the 3D point cloud from airborne LiDAR(ALS)
holds an enormous amount of unordered and irregularly sparse information.
Handling such data is tricky and consumes large memory for processing. Most of
this information is not necessary when we are looking for a particular type of
urban change. In this study, we propose an automatic method that reduces the 3D
point clouds into a much smaller representation without losing the necessary
information required for detecting Building changes. The method utilizes the
Deep Learning(DL) model U-Net for segmenting the buildings from the background.
Produced segmentation maps are then processed further for detecting changes and
the results are refined using morphological methods. For the change detection
task, we used multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data. The data is acquired over
Stockholm in the years 2017 and 2019. The changes in buildings are classified

gradual drifts, a special type of change, in which the cases of two models
overlap during a period of time. The proposed algorithm relies on conformance
checking metrics to carry out the automatic detection of the changes,
performing also a fully automatic classification of these changes into sudden

testing, we develop a family of individual testing statistics with different
weights to account for unknown tail structures. These individual tests are
further aggregated to construct a powerful tail-adaptive test for sparse
regression coefficient changes. For change point estimation, we propose a
family of argmax-based individual estimators. We provide theoretical
justifications for the validity of these tests and change point estimators.

novel method trains a change detector using two spatially unrelated images with
corresponding semantic labels such as building. However, training on unpaired

maintain the visual similarity in unchanged area, in this paper, we emphasize
that the change originates from the source image and show that manipulating the

wealth of data can be useful, e.g., to find changes similar to a planned code
change or examples of recurring code improvements. This paper presents
DiffSearch, a search engine that, given a query that describes a code change,
returns a set of changes that match the query. The approach is enabled by three
key contributions. First, we present a query language that extends the
underlying programming language with wildcards and placeholders, providing an
intuitive way of formulating queries that is easy to adapt to different
programming languages. Second, to ensure scalability, the approach indexes code
changes in a one-time preprocessing step, mapping them into a feature space,
and then performs an efficient search in the feature space for each query.
Third, to guarantee precision, i.e., that any returned code change indeed
matches the given query, we present a tree-based matching algorithm that checks
whether a query can be expanded to a concrete code change. We present
implementations for Java, JavaScript, and Python, and show that the approach
responds within seconds to queries across one million code changes, has a
recall of 80.7% for Java, 89.6% for Python, and 90.4% for JavaScript, enables

Time as Change,2022-01-06T07:20:32Z,Marcello Poletti,"According to Aristotle ""time is the number of change with respect to the
before and after"". That's certainly a vague concept, but at the same time it's
both simple and satisfying from a philosophical point of view: things do not
change along time, but they do change and the measurement of such changes is
what we call time. This deprives time of any attribute of substantiality,
meanwhile depriving it of all problems in defining the properties of time as a
substance. With the rise of Classical Mechanics, Aristotle's view is abandoned
and Newton's concept of ""true"" and absolute time imposes itself; time flows
independently on changes of any kind. Relativity will then radically modify our
concept of time, but won't actually modify the fundamental idea: things keep
changing along time -- changes do not make time. This work will argue
Aristotle's thesis, showing how such an approach automatically leads to the
principles of Special Relativity. An interesting consequence and, at least
virtually, measurable will also be highlighted: the fact that synchronizing two
clocks with a precision greater than a certain scale is impossible, estimating
such scale around $10^{-22}$s.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01944v1

language that is typically restricted to a specific group or social setting. We
analyze the semantic change and frequency shift of slang words and compare them
to those of standard, nonslang words. With causal discovery and causal
inference techniques, we measure the effect that word type (slang/nonslang) has
on both semantic change and frequency shift, as well as its relationship to

Change in Conceptual Modeling and Systems Reconfiguration,2022-04-08T12:49:45Z,Sabah Al-Fedaghi,"In this paper, we explore the notion of change in systems and software
engineering, emphasizing its philosophical elucidation. Generally, it has been
claimed that change is so pervasive in systems that it almost defeats
description and analysis. In this article, we analyze change using the
conceptual modeling technique called a thinging machine (TM), which reflects
change in terms of the actions of creating, processing, releasing,
transferring, and receiving things. We illustrated change in TM modeling with
an example of a system s reconfiguration of business product handling designed
using business process modeling notation (BPMN). Then we analyze the notion of
change and compare its various definitions in philosophy. Specifically, we
examine Zeno s paradox that involves how to account for change and continuity
together in moving things. The problem is that we cannot assert that an arrow
is actually moving when it has been shot from a bow because the arrow needs to
be at a certain place at each point in time, which by definition cannot contain
any duration at all. In our analysis of this problem, we convert the arrow
trajectory into space units called thimacs. In the TM generic actions, two
types of change are identified: state and progression (PROCESS) changes.
Therefore, when an arrow flows to a TM machine that represents a trajectory
space unit, it is rejected, causing it to bounce away to the outside. That is,
the arrow is transferred, arrives, and is transferred back; therefore, the
arrow is never accepted into a thimac in the trajectory at any moment. The
result of such analysis seems to introduce a logical explanation for the notion
of movement discussed in Zeno s puzzles.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04034v1
Neural network-based CUSUM for online change-point detection,2022-10-31T16:47:11Z,"Tingnan Gong, Junghwan Lee, Xiuyuan Cheng, Yao Xie","Change-point detection, detecting an abrupt change in the data distribution

learning. CUSUM is a popular statistical method for online change-point
detection due to its efficiency from recursive computation and constant memory
requirement, and it enjoys statistical optimality. CUSUM requires knowing the
precise pre- and post-change distribution. However, post-change distribution is
usually unknown a priori since it represents anomaly and novelty. Classic CUSUM
can perform poorly when there is a model mismatch with actual data. While
likelihood ratio-based methods encounter challenges facing high dimensional
data, neural networks have become an emerging tool for change-point detection

"On the Relation Between Opinion Change and Information Consumption on

is known about its consequences. Our study sheds a light on the relationship
between one user's opinion change episode and subsequent behavioral change on
an online social media, Reddit. In particular, we look at r/ChangeMyView, an
online community dedicated to debating one's own opinions. Interestingly, this
forum adopts a well-codified schema for explicitly self-reporting opinion
change. Starting from this ground truth, we analyze changes in future online
information consumption behavior that arise after a self-reported opinion
change on sociopolitical topics; and in particular, operationalized in this
work as the participation to sociopolitical subreddits. Such participation
profile is important as it represents one's information diet, and is a reliable
proxy for, e.g., political affiliation or health choices.
  We find that people who report an opinion change are significantly more
likely to change their future participation in a specific subset of online
communities. We characterize which communities are more likely to be abandoned
after opinion change, and find a significant association (r=0.46) between
propaganda-like language used in a community and the increase in chances of
leaving it. We find comparable results (r=0.39) for the opposite direction,
i.e., joining a community. This finding suggests how propagandistic communities
act as a first gateway to internalize a shift in one's sociopolitical opinion.
Finally, we show that the textual content of the discussion associated with
opinion change is indicative of which communities are going to be subject to a
participation change. In fact, a predictive model based only on the opinion
change post is able to pinpoint these communities with an AP@5 of 0.20, similar
to what can be reached by using all the past history of participation in
communities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12196v1

point detection methods have the ability to discover changes in an unsupervised
fashion, which represents a desirable property in the analysis of unbounded and

approaches is represented by their limited ability to handle multivariate and
high-dimensional data, which is frequently observed in modern applications such
as traffic flow prediction, human activity recognition, and smart grids

novel Wasserstein distance-based change point detection approach that models an
initial distribution and monitors its behavior while processing new data
points, providing accurate and robust detection of change points in dynamic

"Using Joint Random Partition Models for Flexible Change Point Analysis
  in Multivariate Processes",2022-01-19T19:22:41Z,"José J. Quinlan, Garritt L. Page, Luis M. Castro","Change point analyses are concerned with identifying positions of an ordered
stochastic process that undergo abrupt local changes of some underlying
distribution. When multiple processes are observed, it is often the case that
information regarding the change point positions is shared across the different
processes. This work describes a method that takes advantage of this type of
information. Since the number and position of change points can be described
through a partition with contiguous clusters, our approach develops a joint
model for these types of partitions. We describe computational strategies
associated with our approach and illustrate improved performance in detecting
change points through a small simulation study. We then apply our method to a

  Hyperspectral Imagery",2022-01-20T07:34:17Z,"Zengfu Hou, Wei Li","Multi-temporal hyperspectral images can be used to detect changed
information, which has gradually attracted researchers' attention. However,
traditional change detection algorithms have not deeply explored the relevance
of spatial and spectral changed features, which leads to low detection
accuracy. To better excavate both spectral and spatial information of changed
features, a joint morphology and patch-tensor change detection (JMPT) method is
proposed. Initially, a patch-based tensor strategy is adopted to exploit
similar property of spatial structure, where the non-overlapping local patch
image is reshaped into a new tensor cube, and then three-order Tucker
decompositon and image reconstruction strategies are adopted to obtain more
robust multi-temporal hyperspectral datasets. Meanwhile, multiple morphological
profiles including max-tree and min-tree are applied to extract different
attributes of multi-temporal images. Finally, these results are fused to
general a final change detection map. Experiments conducted on two real
hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves better
detection performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08027v1

measure modeling how critical is that sample when training change detection
functions. These relevance measures are obtained by minimizing an objective
function mixing diversity, representativity and uncertainty. These criteria
when combined allow exploring different data modes and also refining change
detections. To further explore the potential of this objective function, we
consider a reinforcement learning approach that finds the best combination of

the basic idea of this work. However, existing self-attention models require
significant retraining cost per domain, so it is not directly applicable to

ability of unsupervised on-the-fly domain adaptation, which introduces an
attention mask into the intermediate layer of an image change detection model,

based on image reconstruction loss using only unlabeled single temporal single

extracting a changeset for a branch from a merge commit at once. We compared
the change recommendation results and the similarity of the extracted
co-changes to those in the future obtained using two strategies through 30

of intelligent transportation, especially for driving behavior analysis and

predict lane-changing behaviors taking multi driving styles into account. The
microscopic trajectory data from the Highway Drone Dataset (HighD) are employed
to construct two types of datasets, including precise trajectory datasets and
fuzzy trajectory datasets for lane-changing prediction models. The fuzzy
trajectory data are developed based on different driving styles, which are
clustered by the K-means algorithm. Two typical supervised learning methods,
including random forest and long-short-term memory combined with convolutional

Results indicate that (1) the proposed integration approach performs better
than the conventional lane-changing prediction; (2) the relative speed-related
features have a greater contribution to the lane-changing prediction after
being processed by fuzzy rules based on driving styles; and (3) the difference
among driving styles is more reflected from the state of lateral movement

The LR test implicitly explores a special feature of the estimated factors: the
pre-break and post-break variances can be a singular matrix under the

a problem widely encountered when analyzing large-scale real-time streaming
data. Each stream may have its own change point, at which its data has a
distributional change. With sequentially observed data, a decision maker needs
to declare whether changes have already occurred to the streams at each time
point.Once a stream is declared to have changed, it is deactivated permanently
so that its future data will no longer be collected. This is a compound
decision problem in the sense that the decision maker may want to optimize
certain compound performance metrics that concern all the streams as a whole.
Thus, the decisions are not independent for different streams. Our contribution
is three-fold. First, we propose a general framework for compound performance
metrics that includes the ones considered in the existing works as special
cases and introduces new ones that connect closely with the performance metrics
for single-stream sequential change detection and large-scale hypothesis

oblivious and arbitrary. The change detection algorithm is designed for the
offline setting, where the objective is to detect changes when all data are

behavior, so that slowly changing conditions induce a sudden and drastic change
in dynamics. The Kruskal-Henrard-Neishtadt theorem relates the probability of
each choice to the rates at which the phase space areas enclosed by the
different contours are changing. This represents a connection within
closed-system mechanics, and without dynamical chaos, between spontaneous
change and increase in phase space measure, as required by the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. Quantum mechanically, in contrast, dynamical tunneling allows
adiabaticity to persist, for very slow parameter change, through a classical
splitting of energy contours; the classical and adiabatic limits fail to

theoretically and experimentally investigate polarization changes induced in

changes occur in mean values, standard deviations or correlations of the
variables. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to test the sensitivity for
change detection with and without knowledge about the non-stationarity for
different system dimensions and numbers of normal states. A comparison clearly
shows that the knowledge about the non-stationarity of the system greatly
improves change detection sensitivity for all principal components. This

non-negligibility of posterior estimates of the jump heights. Alternatively,
under the Bayesian paradigm, NOSE treats the step-wise signal as a global
infinite dimensional parameter drawn from a proposed process of atomic
representation, where the random jump heights determine the locations and the
number of change-points simultaneously. The random jump heights are further
modeled by a Gamma-Indian buffet process shrinkage prior under the form of
discrete spike-and-slab. The induced maximum a posteriori estimates of the jump
heights are consistent and enjoy zerodiminishing false negative rate in
discrimination under a 3-sigma rule. The success of NOSE is guaranteed by the
posterior inferential results such as the minimaxity of posterior contraction
rate, and posterior consistency of both locations and the number of abrupt

However, when the volume of datasets is very large or the classes are

volatility. There are often structural changes in volatility over time, and an
accurate estimation of the volatility of financial time series requires careful
identification of change-points. A common approach to modeling the volatility
of time series data is the well-known GARCH model. Although the problem of
change-point estimation of volatility dynamics derived from the GARCH model has
been considered in the literature, these approaches rely on parametric
assumptions of the conditional error distribution, which are often violated in
financial time series. This may lead to inaccuracies in change-point detection
resulting in unreliable GARCH volatility estimates. This paper introduces a
novel change-point detection algorithm based on a semiparametric GARCH model.
The proposed method retains the structural advantages of the GARCH process
while incorporating the flexibility of nonparametric conditional error
distribution. The approach utilizes a penalized likelihood derived from a

results show that in terms of change-point estimation and detection accuracy,

Bayesian variance change point detection with credible sets,2022-11-25T13:29:03Z,"Lorenzo Cappello, Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla","This paper introduces a novel Bayesian approach to detect changes in the
variance of a Gaussian sequence model, focusing on quantifying the uncertainty
in the change point locations and providing a scalable algorithm for inference.
Such a measure of uncertainty is necessary when change point methods are
deployed in sensitive applications, for example, when one is interested in
determining whether an organ is viable for transplant. The key of our proposal
is framing the problem as a product of multiple single changes in the scale
parameter. We fit the model through an iterative procedure similar to what is
done for additive models. The novelty is that each iteration returns a
probability distribution on time instances, which captures the uncertainty in
the change point location. Leveraging a recent result in the literature, we can
show that our proposal is a variational approximation of the exact model
posterior distribution. We study the algorithm's convergence and the change
point localization rate. Extensive experiments in simulation studies illustrate
the performance of our method and the possibility of generalizing it to more

  Change Detection",2022-12-28T17:46:20Z,"Hichem Sahbi, Sebastien Deschamps","Satellite image change detection aims at finding occurrences of targeted
changes in a given scene taken at different instants. This task is highly
challenging due to the acquisition conditions and also to the subjectivity of
changes. In this paper, we investigate satellite image change detection using
active learning. Our method is interactive and relies on a question and answer
model which asks the oracle (user) questions about the most informative display
(dubbed as virtual exemplars), and according to the user's responses, updates
change detections. The main contribution of our method consists in a novel
adversarial model that allows frugally probing the oracle with only the most
representative, diverse and uncertain virtual exemplars. The latter are learned
to challenge the most the trained change decision criteria which ultimately
leads to a better re-estimate of these criteria in the following iterations of
active learning. Conducted experiments show the out-performance of our proposed
adversarial display model against other display strategies as well as the
related work.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13974v1
Unsupervised Change Detection using DRE-CUSUM,2022-01-27T17:25:42Z,"Sudarshan Adiga, Ravi Tandon","This paper presents DRE-CUSUM, an unsupervised density-ratio estimation (DRE)
based approach to determine statistical changes in time-series data when no
knowledge of the pre-and post-change distributions are available. The core idea
behind the proposed approach is to split the time-series at an arbitrary point
and estimate the ratio of densities of distribution (using a parametric model
such as a neural network) before and after the split point. The DRE-CUSUM
change detection statistic is then derived from the cumulative sum (CUSUM) of
the logarithm of the estimated density ratio. We present a theoretical
justification as well as accuracy guarantees which show that the proposed
statistic can reliably detect statistical changes, irrespective of the split
point. While there have been prior works on using density ratio based methods
for change detection, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
unsupervised change detection approach with a theoretical justification and
accuracy guarantees. The simplicity of the proposed framework makes it readily
applicable in various practical settings (including high-dimensional
time-series data); we also discuss generalizations for online change detection.
We experimentally show the superiority of DRE-CUSUM using both synthetic and
real-world datasets over existing state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms
(such as Bayesian online change detection, its variants as well as several
other heuristic methods).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11678v1
Graph similarity learning for change-point detection in dynamic networks,2022-03-29T12:16:38Z,"Deborah Sulem, Henry Kenlay, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong","Dynamic networks are ubiquitous for modelling sequential graph-structured
data, e.g., brain connectome, population flows and messages exchanges. In this
work, we consider dynamic networks that are temporal sequences of graph
snapshots, and aim at detecting abrupt changes in their structure. This task is
often termed network change-point detection and has numerous applications, such
as fraud detection or physical motion monitoring. Leveraging a graph neural
network model, we design a method to perform online network change-point
detection that can adapt to the specific network domain and localise changes
with no delay. The main novelty of our method is to use a siamese graph neural
network architecture for learning a data-driven graph similarity function,
which allows to effectively compare the current graph and its recent history.
Importantly, our method does not require prior knowledge on the network
generative distribution and is agnostic to the type of change-points; moreover,
it can be applied to a large variety of networks, that include for instance
edge weights and node attributes. We show on synthetic and real data that our
method enjoys a number of benefits: it is able to learn an adequate graph
similarity function for performing online network change-point detection in
diverse types of change-point settings, and requires a shorter data history to
detect changes than most existing state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15470v1
"Graph Signal Processing for Heterogeneous Change Detection Part I:
  Vertex Domain Filtering",2022-08-03T07:22:45Z,"Yuli Sun, Lin Lei, Dongdong Guan, Gangyao Kuang, Li Liu","This paper provides a new strategy for the Heterogeneous Change Detection
(HCD) problem: solving HCD from the perspective of Graph Signal Processing
(GSP). We construct a graph for each image to capture the structure
information, and treat each image as the graph signal. In this way, we convert
the HCD into a GSP problem: a comparison of the responses of the two signals on
different systems defined on the two graphs, which attempts to find structural
differences (Part I) and signal differences (Part II) due to the changes
between heterogeneous images. In this first part, we analyze the HCD with GSP
from the vertex domain. We first show that for the unchanged images, their
structures are consistent, and then the outputs of the same signal on systems
defined on the two graphs are similar. However, once a region has changed, the
local structure of the image changes, i.e., the connectivity of the vertex
containing this region changes. Then, we can compare the output signals of the
same input graph signal passing through filters defined on the two graphs to
detect changes. We design different filters from the vertex domain, which can
flexibly explore the high-order neighborhood information hidden in original
graphs. We also analyze the detrimental effects of changing regions on the
change detection results from the viewpoint of signal propagation. Experiments
conducted on seven real data sets show the effectiveness of the vertex domain
filtering based HCD method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01881v2
The Counterfactual-Shapley Value: Attributing Change in System Metrics,2022-08-17T16:48:20Z,"Amit Sharma, Hua Li, Jian Jiao","Given an unexpected change in the output metric of a large-scale system, it
is important to answer why the change occurred: which inputs caused the change
in metric? A key component of such an attribution question is estimating the
counterfactual: the (hypothetical) change in the system metric due to a
specified change in a single input. However, due to inherent stochasticity and
complex interactions between parts of the system, it is difficult to model an
output metric directly. We utilize the computational structure of a system to
break up the modelling task into sub-parts, such that each sub-part corresponds
to a more stable mechanism that can be modelled accurately over time. Using the
system's structure also helps to view the metric as a computation over a
structural causal model (SCM), thus providing a principled way to estimate
counterfactuals. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate counterfactuals
using time-series predictive models and construct an attribution score,
CF-Shapley, that is consistent with desirable axioms for attributing an
observed change in the output metric. Unlike past work on causal shapley
values, our proposed method can attribute a single observed change in output
(rather than a population-level effect) and thus provides more accurate
attribution scores when evaluated on simulated datasets. As a real-world
application, we analyze a query-ad matching system with the goal of attributing
observed change in a metric for ad matching density. Attribution scores explain
how query volume and ad demand from different query categories affect the ad
matching density, leading to actionable insights and uncovering the role of
external events (e.g., ""Cheetah Day"") in driving the matching density.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08399v1

  Scene Graphs",2022-09-16T12:41:43Z,"Samuel Looper, Javier Rodriguez-Puigvert, Roland Siegwart, Cesar Cadena, Lukas Schmid","Numerous applications require robots to operate in environments shared with
other agents, such as humans or other robots. However, such shared scenes are
typically subject to different kinds of long-term semantic scene changes. The
ability to model and predict such changes is thus crucial for robot autonomy.
In this work, we formalize the task of semantic scene variability estimation
and identify three main varieties of semantic scene change: changes in the
position of an object, its semantic state, or the composition of a scene as a
whole. To represent this variability, we propose the Variable Scene Graph
(VSG), which augments existing 3D Scene Graph (SG) representations with the
variability attribute, representing the likelihood of discrete long-term change
events. We present a novel method, DeltaVSG, to estimate the variability of
VSGs in a supervised fashion. We evaluate our method on the 3RScan long-term
dataset, showing notable improvements in this novel task over existing
approaches. Our method DeltaVSG achieves an accuracy of 77.1% and a recall of
72.3%, often mimicking human intuition about how indoor scenes change over
time. We further show the utility of VSG prediction in the task of active
robotic change detection, speeding up task completion by 66.0% compared to a
scene-change-unaware planner. We make our code available as open-source.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07896v2

  During Solar Flares Using High-cadence Vector Magnetograms and Their
  Association with Flare Ribbons",2022-10-25T18:34:20Z,"Rahul Yadav, Maria D. Kazachenko","We analyze high-cadence vector magnetograms (135~s) and flare-ribbon
observations of 37 flares from the Solar Dynamics Observatory to understand the
spatial and temporal properties of changes in the photospheric vector magnetic
field and their relationship to footpoints of reconnected fields. Confirming
previous studies, we find that the largest permanent changes in the horizontal
field component lie near the polarity inversion line, whereas changes in the
vertical field are less pronounced and are distributed throughout the active
region. We find that pixels swept up by ribbons do not always exhibit permanent
changes in the field. However, when they do, ribbon emission typically occurs
several minutes before the start of field changes. The changes in the
properties of the field show no relation to the size of active regions, but are
strongly related to the flare-ribbon properties such as ribbon magnetic flux
and ribbon area. For the first time, we find that the duration of permanent
changes in the field is strongly coupled with the duration of the flare,
lasting on average 29\% of the duration of the GOES flare. Our results suggest
that changes in photospheric magnetic fields are caused by a combination of two
scenarios: contraction of flare loops driven by magnetic reconnection and
coronal implosion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14264v2
"Higher-order Knowledge Transfer for Dynamic Community Detection with
  Great Changes",2022-11-28T04:06:39Z,"Huixin Ma, Kai Wu, Handing Wang, Jing Liu","Network structure evolves with time in the real world, and the discovery of
changing communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that
poses challenging tasks. Most existing methods assume that no significant
change in the network occurs; namely, the difference between adjacent snapshots
is slight. However, great change exists in the real world usually. The great
change in the network will result in the community detection algorithms are
difficulty obtaining valuable information from the previous snapshot, leading
to negative transfer for the next time steps. This paper focuses on dynamic
community detection with substantial changes by integrating higher-order
knowledge from the previous snapshots to aid the subsequent snapshots.
Moreover, to improve search efficiency, a higher-order knowledge transfer
strategy is designed to determine first-order and higher-order knowledge by
detecting the similarity of the adjacency matrix of snapshots. In this way, our
proposal can better keep the advantages of previous community detection results
and transfer them to the next task. We conduct the experiments on four
real-world networks, including the networks with great or minor changes.
Experimental results in the low-similarity datasets demonstrate that
higher-order knowledge is more valuable than first-order knowledge when the
network changes significantly and keeps the advantage even if handling the
high-similarity datasets. Our proposal can also guide other dynamic
optimization problems with great changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15043v1

"Estimating Rate of Change for Nonlinear Trajectories in the Framework of
  Individual Measurement Occasions: A New Perspective on Growth Curves",2022-01-03T04:34:59Z,"Jin Liu, Robert A. Perera","Researchers are often interested in examining between-individual differences
in within-individual processes. If the process under investigation is tracked
for a long time, its trajectory may show a certain degree of nonlinearity, so
that the rate-of-change is not constant. A fundamental goal of modeling such
nonlinear processes is to estimate model parameters that reflect meaningful
aspects of change, including the parameters related to change and other
parameters that shed light on substantive hypotheses. However, if the
measurement occasion is unstructured, existing models cannot simultaneously
estimate these two types of parameters. This article has three goals. First, we
view the change over time as the area under the curve (AUC) of the
rate-of-change versus time (r-t) graph. Second, using the instantaneous
rate-of-change midway through a time interval to approximate the average
rate-of-change during that interval, we propose a new specification to describe
longitudinal processes. In addition to obtaining the individual change-related
parameters and other parameters related to specific research questions, the new
specification allows for unequally-space study waves and individual measurement
occasions around each wave. Third, we derive the model-based interval-specific
change and change-from-baseline, two common measures to evaluate change over
time. We evaluate the proposed specification through a simulation study and a
real-world data analysis. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for each

the individual level, reputational uncertainty induces more leniency and
forgiveness in imposing network punishment through the link proposal and
removal processes, inhibiting the formation of cooperative clusters. However,
this effect is significant only in the fast-changing environment and not in the

Introduction to phase transmission fibre-optic sensing of seismic waves,2022-02-28T06:49:47Z,"Andreas Fichtner, Adonis Bogris, Thomas Nikas, Daniel Bowden, Konstantinos Lentas, Nikolaos S. Melis, Christos Simos, Iraklis Simos, Krystyna Smolinski","This manuscript is concerned with phase changes of signals transmitted
through deforming optical fibres. As a first result, it establishes an exact
relation between observable phase changes and the deformation tensor along the
fibre. This relation is non-linear, and it includes effects related to both
local changes in fibre length and deformation-induced changes of the local
speed of light or refractive index. In seismic applications, where the norm of
the earthquake-induced deformation tensor is orders of magnitude smaller than
1, a useful first-order relation can be derived. It simply connects phase
changes to an integral over in-line strain along the fibre times the local
refractive index. Under the assumption that spatial variations of the
refractive index are fast compared to the seismic wavelength, this permits a
direct synthesis of phase change measurements from distributed strain
measurements, for instance, from Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). A more
detailed analysis of the first-order relation reveals that a perfectly straight
fibre would produce zero phase change measurements, unless deformation was
sufficiently widespread to affect the starting and end points of the fibre. If
this condition is not met, non-zero measurements can only result from curvature
of the fibre or from a heterogeneous distribution of the refractive index.
Segments of the fibre that are strongly curved generally make larger
contributions to the observed phase change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13574v1

How to Reduce Change Detection to Semantic Segmentation,2022-06-15T14:16:30Z,"Guo-Hua Wang, Bin-Bin Gao, Chengjie Wang","Change detection (CD) aims to identify changes that occur in an image pair
taken different times. Prior methods devise specific networks from scratch to
predict change masks in pixel-level, and struggle with general segmentation
problems. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that reduces CD to semantic
segmentation which means tailoring an existing and powerful semantic
segmentation network to solve CD. This new paradigm conveniently enjoys the
mainstream semantic segmentation techniques to deal with general segmentation
problems in CD. Hence we can concentrate on studying how to detect changes. We
propose a novel and importance insight that different change types exist in CD
and they should be learned separately. Based on it, we devise a module named
MTF to extract the change information and fuse temporal features. MTF enjoys
high interpretability and reveals the essential characteristic of CD. And most
segmentation networks can be adapted to solve the CD problems with our MTF
module. Finally, we propose C-3PO, a network to detect changes at pixel-level.

  for Change Detection",2022-06-23T17:58:29Z,"Wele Gedara Chaminda Bandara, Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair, Vishal M. Patel","Remote sensing change detection is crucial for understanding the dynamics of
our planet's surface, facilitating the monitoring of environmental changes,
evaluating human impact, predicting future trends, and supporting
decision-making. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for change
detection that can leverage off-the-shelf, unlabeled remote sensing images in
the training process by pre-training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(DDPM) - a class of generative models used in image synthesis. DDPMs learn the
training data distribution by gradually converting training images into a
Gaussian distribution using a Markov chain. During inference (i.e., sampling),
they can generate a diverse set of samples closer to the training distribution,
starting from Gaussian noise, achieving state-of-the-art image synthesis
results. However, in this work, our focus is not on image synthesis but on
utilizing it as a pre-trained feature extractor for the downstream application
of change detection. Specifically, we fine-tune a lightweight change classifier
utilizing the feature representations produced by the pre-trained DDPM
alongside change labels. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD,
DSIFN-CD, and CDD datasets demonstrate that the proposed DDPM-CD method
significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art change detection
methods in terms of F1 score, IoU, and overall accuracy, highlighting the
pivotal role of pre-trained DDPM as a feature extractor for downstream
applications. We have made both the code and pre-trained models available at

CoSIm: Commonsense Reasoning for Counterfactual Scene Imagination,2022-07-08T15:28:23Z,"Hyounghun Kim, Abhay Zala, Mohit Bansal","As humans, we can modify our assumptions about a scene by imagining
alternative objects or concepts in our minds. For example, we can easily
anticipate the implications of the sun being overcast by rain clouds (e.g., the
street will get wet) and accordingly prepare for that. In this paper, we
introduce a new task/dataset called Commonsense Reasoning for Counterfactual
Scene Imagination (CoSIm) which is designed to evaluate the ability of AI
systems to reason about scene change imagination. In this task/dataset, models
are given an image and an initial question-response pair about the image. Next,
a counterfactual imagined scene change (in textual form) is applied, and the
model has to predict the new response to the initial question based on this
scene change. We collect 3.5K high-quality and challenging data instances, with
each instance consisting of an image, a commonsense question with a response, a
description of a counterfactual change, a new response to the question, and
three distractor responses. Our dataset contains various complex scene change
types (such as object addition/removal/state change, event description,
environment change, etc.) that require models to imagine many different
scenarios and reason about the changed scenes. We present a baseline model
based on a vision-language Transformer (i.e., LXMERT) and ablation studies.
Through human evaluation, we demonstrate a large human-model performance gap,
suggesting room for promising future work on this challenging counterfactual,
scene imagination task. Our code and dataset are publicly available at:

desirable for autonomous agents to detect changes amongst maps of different
sessions so as to gain a conflict-free understanding of the current
environment. In this paper, we look into the problem of change detection based
on a novel map representation, dubbed Plane Signed Distance Fields (PlaneSDF),
where dense maps are represented as a collection of planes and their associated
geometric components in SDF volumes. Given point clouds of the source and
target scenes, we propose a three-step PlaneSDF-based change detection
approach: (1) PlaneSDF volumes are instantiated within each scene and
registered across scenes using plane poses; 2D height maps and object maps are
extracted per volume via height projection and connected component analysis.
(2) Height maps are compared and intersected with the object map to produce a
2D change location mask for changed object candidates in the source scene. (3)
3D geometric validation is performed using SDF-derived features per object
candidate for change mask refinement. We evaluate our approach on both
synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via the

On Controller Tuning with Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization,2022-07-22T14:54:13Z,"Paul Brunzema, Alexander von Rohr, Sebastian Trimpe","Changing conditions or environments can cause system dynamics to vary over
time. To ensure optimal control performance, controllers should adapt to these
changes. When the underlying cause and time of change is unknown, we need to
rely on online data for this adaptation. In this paper, we will use
time-varying Bayesian optimization (TVBO) to tune controllers online in
changing environments using appropriate prior knowledge on the control
objective and its changes. Two properties are characteristic of many online
controller tuning problems: First, they exhibit incremental and lasting changes
in the objective due to changes to the system dynamics, e.g., through wear and
tear. Second, the optimization problem is convex in the tuning parameters.
Current TVBO methods do not explicitly account for these properties, resulting
in poor tuning performance and many unstable controllers through
over-exploration of the parameter space. We propose a novel TVBO forgetting
strategy using Uncertainty-Injection (UI), which incorporates the assumption of
incremental and lasting changes. The control objective is modeled as a
spatio-temporal Gaussian process (GP) with UI through a Wiener process in the
temporal domain. Further, we explicitly model the convexity assumptions in the
spatial dimension through GP models with linear inequality constraints. In
numerical experiments, we show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
method in TVBO, exhibiting reduced regret and fewer unstable parameter
configurations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11120v1

  Point Charges",2022-10-07T12:21:08Z,Timothy H. Boyer,"Although the expressions for energy densities involving electric and magnetic
fields are exactly analogous, the connections to forces and electromagnetic
potentials are vastly different. For electrostatic situations, the changes in
the \textit{electric} energy can be related directly to \textit{electric}
forces and to the electrostatic potential. The situation involving magnetic
forces and energy changes involves two fundamentally different situations. For
charged particles moving with constant velocities, the changes in both electric

particles' velocities constant; there are no Faraday acceleration electric
fields in this situation. However, for particles that change speed, the changes
in \textit{magnetic} energy density are related to acceleration-dependent
Faraday \textit{electric} fields. Current undergraduate and graduate textbooks
deal only with highly symmetric situations where the Faraday electric fields
are easily calculated from the time-changing magnetic flux. However, in
situations that lack high symmetry, such as the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm
situation, the back (Faraday) acceleration electric fields of point charges

investigate the relationship between the structure of metallic melts (Pb/Al)

energy does not change significantly with temperature, the Wulff shape changed
evidently. When temperature raise to 975K, Pb(321) surface that has the highest
interaction strength completely disappears, while the abnormal viscosity drop
happens at the same temperature range. Oppositely, Al(100) surface that has the
lowest interaction strength disappears when temperature is higher than 1075K,
and at the same temperature range, the abnormal viscosity rise has been
observed. The abnormal viscosity drop corresponds to the disappearance of
surface with the highest interaction strength (Pb(321) surface), while the rise
one corresponds to the disappearance of surface with the lowest adsorption
energy (Al(100) surface). All evidence indicates that the uniformity between
abnormal viscosity change and the change of Wulff shape is not a coincidence. A
possible mechanism of the abnormal viscosity change is that it caused by the

"""Why did the Model Fail?"": Attributing Model Performance Changes to
  Distribution Shifts",2022-10-19T17:58:09Z,"Haoran Zhang, Harvineet Singh, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Shalmali Joshi","Machine learning models frequently experience performance drops under
distribution shifts. The underlying cause of such shifts may be multiple
simultaneous factors such as changes in data quality, differences in specific
covariate distributions, or changes in the relationship between label and
features. When a model does fail during deployment, attributing performance
change to these factors is critical for the model developer to identify the
root cause and take mitigating actions. In this work, we introduce the problem
of attributing performance differences between environments to distribution
shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms. We formulate the problem
as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define the value
of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only this
set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance
weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions.
The contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then
quantified as its Shapley value. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of
our method on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world case studies, showing
its effectiveness in attributing performance changes to a wide range of
distribution shifts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10769v3

achieve a sub-linear regret with respect to the class of Disturbance Action
Control (DAC) policies, which are a widely studied class of policies for online
control of dynamical systems, for any sub-linear number of changes and very
general class of systems: (i) matched disturbance system with general convex
cost functions, (ii) general system with linear cost functions. Specifically, a
(dynamic) regret of $\Gamma_T^{1/5}T^{4/5}$ can be achieved for these class of
systems, where $\Gamma_T$ is the number of changes of the underlying system and
$T$ is the duration of the control episode. That is, the change point detection
approach achieves a sub-linear regret for any sub-linear number of changes,

  Numerically, we demonstrate that the change point detection approach is
superior to a standard restart approach \cite{minasyan2021online} and to
standard online learning approaches for time-invariant dynamical systems. Our

technology with some privilege over the RGB cameras. The most important one is
their difference in capturing the light changes in the environment, each pixel

output of these cameras, such as changing the sensitivity of the sensor to
light changes, controlling the number of generated events and other similar
operations, the camera manufacturers usually introduce some tools to make
sensor level changes in camera settings. The contribution of this research is
to examine and document the effects of changing the sensor settings on the
sharpness as an indicator of quality of the generated stream of event data. To
have a qualitative understanding this stream of event is converted to frames,

at an unknown point in time and the duration of a change is substantially
finite, in which case one says that the change is intermittent or transient. We
provide an overview of existing approaches for intermittent change detection
and advocate in favor of a particular setting driven by the intermittent nature
of the change. We propose a novel optimization criterion that is more
appropriate for many applied areas such as the detection of threats in
physical-computer systems, near-Earth space informatics, epidemiology,
pharmacokinetics, etc. We argue that controlling the local conditional
probability of a false alarm, rather than the familiar average run length to a
false alarm, and maximizing the local conditional probability of detection is a
more reasonable approach versus a traditional quickest change detection
approach that requires minimizing the expected delay to detection. We adopt the
maximum likelihood (ML) approach with respect to the change duration and show
that several commonly used detection rules (CUSUM, window-limited CUSUM, and
FMA) are equivalent to the ML-based stopping times. We discuss how to choose
design parameters for these rules and provide a comprehensive simulation study

Automatic Change-Point Detection in Time Series via Deep Learning,2022-11-07T20:59:14Z,"Jie Li, Paul Fearnhead, Piotr Fryzlewicz, Tengyao Wang","Detecting change-points in data is challenging because of the range of
possible types of change and types of behaviour of data when there is no

both of these features, and it can be difficult for a practitioner to develop
an appropriate detection method for their application of interest. We show how
to automatically generate new offline detection methods based on training a
neural network. Our approach is motivated by many existing tests for the
presence of a change-point being representable by a simple neural network, and
thus a neural network trained with sufficient data should have performance at
least as good as these methods. We present theory that quantifies the error
rate for such an approach, and how it depends on the amount of training data.
Empirical results show that, even with limited training data, its performance
is competitive with the standard CUSUM-based classifier for detecting a change

generalize effectively within the same time series as different types of CPs
may require different detection methods. As the volume of multidimensional time
series continues to grow, capturing various types of complex CPs such as
changes in the correlation structure of the time-series features has become
essential. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose TiVaCPD,
an approach that uses a Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (TVGL) to identify changes
in correlation patterns between multidimensional features over time, and
combines that with an aggregate Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test to
identify changes in the underlying statistical distributions of dynamic time
windows with varying length. The MMD and TVGL scores are combined using a novel

be developed to relieve the high burden of drug addiction to society. This will
only be possible by enhancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the neurobiology of addiction. Recent experimental data have shown
that dendritic spines, small protrusions from the dendrites that receive input
from excitatory neurons, from spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens exhibit
morphological changes during drug exposure and withdrawal. Moreover, these
changes relate to the characteristic drug-seeking behavior of addiction.
However, due to the complexity of the dendritic spines, we do not yet fully
understand the processes underlying their structural changes in response to
different inputs. We propose that biophysical models can enhance the current
understanding of these processes by incorporating different, and sometimes,
discrepant experimental data to identify the shared underlying mechanisms and
generate experimentally testable hypotheses. This review aims to give an
up-to-date report on biophysical models of dendritic spines, focusing on those

explore possible cooperations between an AV and the others. Further, an
evaluation is designed to make a decision on lane change, in which safety,
efficiency and comfort are taken into consideration. Thereafter, we propose a
motion planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC), which
incorporates AV's decision and surrounding vehicles' interactive behaviors into
constraints so as to avoid collisions during lane change. Quantitative testing
results show that compared with the methods without an interactive prediction,
our method enhances driving efficiencies of the AV and other vehicles by

framework factorizes unknown distribution shifts into transition distribution
changes caused by fixed dynamics and time-varying latent causal relations, and
by global changes in observation. We establish the identifiability theories of
nonparametric latent causal dynamics from their nonlinear mixtures under fixed

"Collar-aware Training for Streaming Speaker Change Detection in
  Broadcast Speech",2022-05-14T15:35:43Z,"Joonas Kalda, Tanel Alumäe","In this paper, we present a novel training method for speaker change
detection models. Speaker change detection is often viewed as a binary sequence
labelling problem. The main challenges with this approach are the vagueness of
annotated change points caused by the silences between speaker turns and
imbalanced data due to the majority of frames not including a speaker change.
Conventional training methods tackle these by artificially increasing the
proportion of positive labels in the training data. Instead, the proposed
method uses an objective function which encourages the model to predict a
single positive label within a specified collar. This is done by marginalizing
over all possible subsequences that have exactly one positive label within the
collar. Experiments on English and Estonian datasets show large improvements
over the conventional training method. Additionally, the model outputs have
peaks concentrated to a single frame, removing the need for post-processing to
find the exact predicted change point which is particularly useful for
streaming applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07086v1
Detecting Abrupt Changes in Sequential Pairwise Comparison Data,2022-05-25T01:40:08Z,"Wanshan Li, Daren Wang, Alessandro Rinaldo","The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a classic and very popular statistical
approach for eliciting a global ranking among a collection of items using
pairwise comparison data. In applications in which the comparison outcomes are
observed as a time series, it is often the case that data are non-stationary,
in the sense that the true underlying ranking changes over time. In this paper
we are concerned with localizing the change points in a high-dimensional BTL
model with piece-wise constant parameters. We propose novel and practicable
algorithms based on dynamic programming that can consistently estimate the
unknown locations of the change points. We provide consistency rates for our
methodology that depend explicitly on the model parameters, the temporal
spacing between two consecutive change points and the magnitude of the change.

changes in a cluster when the affected data stream distribution shifts from one
point process to another with different parameters. Specifically, we are
interested in detecting a change point that causes a shift of the underlying
data distribution that follows a multivariate Hawkes process with exponential
decay temporal kernel, whereby the Hawkes process is considered to account for
spatio-temporal correlation between observations. The proposed detection
procedure is based on scan score statistics. We derive the asymptotic
distribution of the statistic, which enables the self-normalizing property and
facilitates the approximation of the instantaneous false alarm probability and
the average run length. When detecting a change in the Hawkes process with
non-vanishing self-excitation, the procedure does not require estimating the
post-change network parameter while assuming the temporal decay parameter,
which enjoys computational efficiency. We further present an efficient
procedure to accurately determine the false discovery rate via importance
sampling, as validated by numerical examples. Using simulated and real stock
exchange data, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting
change while enjoying computational efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08453v3
Multiple change point detection in tensors,2022-06-27T00:57:24Z,"Jiaqi Huang, Junhui Wang, Xuehu Zhu, Lixing Zhu","This paper proposes a criterion for detecting change structures in tensor
data. To accommodate tensor structure with structural mode that is not suitable
to be equally treated and summarized in a distance to measure the difference
between any two adjacent tensors, we define a mode-based signal-screening
Frobenius distance for the moving sums of slices of tensor data to handle both
dense and sparse model structures of the tensors. As a general distance, it can
also deal with the case without structural mode. Based on the distance, we then
construct signal statistics using the ratios with adaptive-to-change ridge
functions. The number of changes and their locations can then be consistently
estimated in certain senses, and the confidence intervals of the locations of
change points are constructed. The results hold when the size of the tensor and
the number of change points diverge at certain rates, respectively. Numerical
studies are conducted to examine the finite sample performances of the proposed
method. We also analyze two real data examples for illustration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13004v2

Automated Change Rule Inference for Distance-Based API Misuse Detection,2022-07-14T05:35:14Z,"Sebastian Nielebock, Paul Blockhaus, Jacob Krüger, Frank Ortmeier","Developers build on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to reuse
existing functionalities of code libraries. Despite the benefits of reusing
established libraries (e.g., time savings, high quality), developers may
diverge from the API's intended usage; potentially causing bugs or, more
specifically, API misuses. Recent research focuses on developing techniques to
automatically detect API misuses, but many suffer from a high false-positive
rate. In this article, we improve on this situation by proposing ChaRLI (Change
RuLe Inference), a technique for automatically inferring change rules from
developers' fixes of API misuses based on API Usage Graphs (AUGs). By
subsequently applying graph-distance algorithms, we use change rules to
discriminate API misuses from correct usages. This allows developers to reuse
others' fixes of an API misuse at other code locations in the same or another

on three datasets and found that the best mean relative precision (i.e., for
testable usages) ranges from 77.1 % to 96.1 % while the mean recall ranges from

of convergence for the estimators of the locations of the change points. More
precisely, two different types of MOSUM (moving sum) statistics are considered:
A MOSUM-Wald statistic based on differences of local estimators and a
MOSUM-score statistic based on a global estimator. The latter is usually
computationally less involved in particular in non-linear problems where no

Quickest change point detection has become a vital sequential analysis
primitive that aims at designing procedures that minimize the expected
detection delay of a change subject to a bounded expected false alarm time. We
put forward the quantum counterpart of this fundamental primitive on streams of
quantum data. We give a lower-bound on the mean minimum delay when the expected
time of a false alarm is asymptotically large, under the most general quantum
detection strategy, which is given by a sequence of adaptive collective
(potentially weak) measurements on the growing string of quantum data. In
addition, we give particular strategies based on repeated measurements on

quantity of annotated data which is tedious and expensive to obtain. On the
other hand, transfer learning from large datasets induces domain shift. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel \textit{Differencing

learn discriminatory representations corresponding to the changed regions while
simultaneously tackling the noisy changes by enforcing temporal invariance

effectiveness of our method, specifically to differences in camera viewpoints

analyse data that is unevenly spaced, allow for heterogeneous noise variance,

in-depth analysis of the degrees of semantic change predicted for English words
across 5 decades. Our findings show that contextualized methods can often
predict high change scores for words which are not undergoing any real
diachronic semantic shift in the lexicographic sense of the term (or at least
the status of these shifts is questionable). Such challenging cases are
discussed in detail with examples, and their linguistic categorization is
proposed. Our conclusion is that pre-trained contextualized language models are
prone to confound changes in lexicographic senses and changes in contextual
variance, which naturally stem from their distributional nature, but is
different from the types of issues observed in methods based on static

missions. It takes bi-temporal images as input and predicts ""where"" the change

consideration for change detection is the interaction between bi-temporal
features. With this motivation, in this paper we propose a novel general change
detection architecture, MetaChanger, which includes a series of alternative
interaction layers in the feature extractor. To verify the effectiveness of
MetaChanger, we propose two derived models, ChangerAD and ChangerEx with simple
interaction strategies: Aggregation-Distribution (AD) and ""exchange"". AD is
abstracted from some complex interaction methods, and ""exchange"" is a
completely parameter\&computation-free operation by exchanging bi-temporal
features. In addition, for better alignment of bi-temporal features, we propose
a flow dual-alignment fusion (FDAF) module which allows interactive alignment
and feature fusion. Crucially, we observe Changer series models achieve
competitive performance on different scale change detection datasets. Further,
our proposed ChangerAD and ChangerEx could serve as a starting baseline for
future MetaChanger design.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08290v1

Element (RVE) and 3) by changing the fiber radius. Cases with change in
dimension of RVE and change in fiber radius, periodic and semi-random

to radically lower its electrical conductance. The high power and concomitantly
high current density required to reset phase change materials is the major
issue that limits the access times of 3D phase change memory architectures.
Phase change superlattices were developed to lower the reset energy by
confining the phase transition to the interface between two different phase
change materials. However, the high thermal conductivity of the superlattices
means that heat is poorly confined within the phase change material, and most
of the thermal energy is wasted to the surrounding materials. Here, we
identified Ti as a useful dopant for substantially lowering the thermal
conductivity of Sb2Te3-GeTe superlattices whilst also stabilising the layered
structure from unwanted disordering. We demonstrate via laser heating that
lowering the thermal conductivity by doping the Sb2Te3 layers with Ti halves
the switching energy compared to superlattices that only use interfacial phase
change transitions and strain engineering. The thermally optimized superlattice
has (0 0 l) crystallographic orientation yet a thermal conductivity of just
0.25 W/m.K in the ""on"" (set) state. Prototype phase change memory devices that
incorporate this Ti-doped superlattice switch faster and and at a substantially
lower voltage than the undoped superlattice. During switching the Ti-doped
Sb2Te3 layers remain stable within the superlattice and only the Ge atoms are

localized regions of active regions during solar flares called magnetic
imprints (MIs), have been observed for the past nearly three decades. The well
known ""coronal implosion"" model is assumed to explain such flare associated
changes but the complete physical understanding is still missing and debatable.
In this study, we made a systematic analysis of flare-related changes of
photospheric magnetic field during 21 flares (14 eruptive and 7 non-eruptive)
using the high-cadence (\texttt{135s}) vector-magnetogram data obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. The MI regions for eruptive flares are found
to be strongly localised, whereas the majority of non-eruptive events
($>70~\%$) have scattered imprint regions. To quantify the strength of the MIs,
we derived the integrated change of horizontal field and total change of
Lorentz force over an area. These quantities correlate well with the flare
strength, irrespective of whether flares being eruptive or not, short or long
duration. Further, the free-energy (FE), determined from virial-theorem
estimates, exhibits statistically significant downward trend which starts
around the flare time is observed in majority of flares. The change of FE
during flares do not depend on eruptivity but have a strong positive
correlation ($\approx 0.8$) with the Lorentz force change, indicating that the

steps: it first learns the embedded topology as a point cloud via persistence
diagrams, then applies a non-parametric monitoring approach for detecting
changes in the resulting point cloud distributions. This yields a
non-parametric, topology-aware framework which can efficiently detect online
changes from high-dimensional data streams. We investigate the effectiveness of
PERCEPT over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments where the

satisfaction of engineers. While factors affecting code change acceptance have
been investigated in the past, solutions to decrease the code review lifetime

quantify delays and investigate opportunities to potentially increase code
velocity. We study the temporal characteristics of half a million code reviews
hosted on Gerrit and Phabricator, starting from the first response, to a
decision to accept or reject the changes, and until the changes are merged into
a target branch. We identified two types of time delays: (a) the wait time from
the proposal of code changes until first response, and (b) the wait time
between acceptance and merging. Our study indicates that reducing the time
between acceptance and merging has the potential to speed up Phabricator code
reviews by 29-63%. Small code changes and changes made by authors with a large
number of previously accepted code reviews have a higher chance of being
immediately accepted, without code review iterations. Our analysis suggests
that switching from manual to automatic merges can help increase code velocity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05048v1
Change of Basis from Bernstein to Zernike,2022-03-17T13:03:34Z,D. A. Wolfram,"We increase the scope of previous work on change of basis between finite
bases of polynomials by defining ascending and descending bases and introducing
three techniques for defining them from known ones.
  The minimum degrees of polynomials in an ascending basis can increase such as
with bases of Bernstein and Zernike Radial polynomials. They have applications
in computer-aided design and optics.
  We give coefficient functions for mappings from the monomials to descending
bases of Bernstein polynomials, and ascending ones of Zernike Radial
polynomials and prove their correctness.
  Allowing for parity, we define eight general change of basis matrices and the
related equations for composing their coefficient functions.
  A main example is the change of basis from shifted Legendre polynomials to
Bernstein polynomials considered by R Farouki [7]. The analysis enables us to
find a more general hypergeometric function for the coefficient function, and
recurrences for finding coefficient functions by matrix row and column. We show
the column coefficient functions are equivalent to the Lagrange interpolation
polynomials of their elements. We also provide a solution to an open problem
[7] by showing there is no general closed form expression for the coefficient
function from Gosper's Algorithm.
  Truncation, alternation and superposition increase the scope further.
Alternation enables, for example, a change of basis between Bernstein and
Zernike Radial polynomials. A summary shows that the groupoid of change of

"An End-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Cross-Domain
  Change Detection",2022-04-01T01:35:30Z,"Jia Liu, Wenjie Xuan, Yuhang Gan, Juhua Liu, Bo Du","Existing deep learning-based change detection methods try to elaborately
design complicated neural networks with powerful feature representations, but
ignore the universal domain shift induced by time-varying land cover changes,
including luminance fluctuations and season changes between pre-event and
post-event images, thereby producing sub-optimal results. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation framework for cross-domain
Change Detection, namely SDACD, to effectively alleviate the domain shift
between bi-temporal images for better change predictions. Specifically, our
SDACD presents collaborative adaptations from both image and feature
perspectives with supervised learning. Image adaptation exploits generative
adversarial learning with cycle-consistency constraints to perform cross-domain
style transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap in a two-side
generation fashion. As to feature adaptation, we extract domain-invariant
features to align different feature distributions in the feature space, which
could further reduce the domain gap of cross-domain images. To further improve
the performance, we combine three types of bi-temporal images for the final
change prediction, including the initial input bi-temporal images and two
generated bi-temporal images from the pre-event and post-event domains.
Extensive experiments and analyses on two benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and universality of our proposed framework. Notably, our
framework pushes several representative baseline models up to new
State-Of-The-Art records, achieving 97.34% and 92.36% on the CDD and WHU
building datasets, respectively. The source code and models are publicly

understanding of segments without evaluating the fine-grained status changes
inside. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called Kinetic-GEB+. The
dataset consists of over 170k boundaries associated with captions describing
status changes in the generic events in 12K videos. Upon this new dataset, we
propose three tasks supporting the development of a more fine-grained, robust,

representative baselines in our dataset, where we also design a new TPD

achieve significant performance improvements. Besides, the results show there
are still formidable challenges for current methods in the utilization of
different granularities, representation of visual difference, and the accurate
localization of status changes. Further analysis shows that our dataset can
drive developing more powerful methods to understand status changes and thus

Quantum particles in a suddenly accelerating potential,2022-06-03T01:10:46Z,"Paolo Amore, Francisco M. Fernández, Jose Luis Valdez","We study the behavior of a quantum particle trapped in a confining potential
in one dimension under multiple sudden changes of velocity and/or acceleration.
We develop the appropriate formalism to deal with such situation and we use it
to calculate the probability of transition for simple problems such as the
particle in an infinite box and the simple harmonic oscillator. For the
infinite box of length $L$ under two and three sudden changes of velocity,
where the initial and final velocity vanish, we find that the system undergoes
quantum revivals for $\Delta t = \tau_0 \equiv \frac{4mL^2}{\pi\hbar}$,
regardless of other parameters ($\Delta t$ is the time elapsed between the
first and last change of velocity). For the simple harmonic oscillator we find
that the states obtained by suddenly changing (one change) the velocity and/or
the acceleration of the potential, for a particle initially in an eigenstate of
the static potential, are {\sl coherent} states. For multiple changes of
acceleration or velocity we find that the quantum expectation value of the
Hamiltonian is remarkably close (possibly identical) to the corresponding
classical expectation values. Finally, the probability of transition for a
particle in an accelerating harmonic oscillator (no sudden changes) calculated
with our formalism agrees with the formula derived long time ago by Ludwig and
recently modified by Dodonov~\cite{Dodonov21}, but with a different expression
for the dimensionless parameter $\gamma$. Our probability agrees with the one
of ref.~\cite{Dodonov21} for $\gamma \ll 1$ but is not periodic in time (it
decays monotonously), contrary to the result derived in ref.~\cite{Dodonov21}.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01354v1

  Empirical Studies in Computer Science",2022-06-27T11:42:08Z,"Margarita Cruz, Beatriz Bernárdez, Amador Durán, Cathy Guevara-Vega, Antonio Ruiz-Cortés","Context: The need of replicating empirical studies in Computer Science (CS)
is widely recognized among the research community to consolidate acquired
knowledge generalizing results. It is essential to report the changes of each
replication to understand the evolution of the experimental validity across a
family of studies. Unfortunately, the lack of proposals undermines these
objectives.
  Objective. The main goal of our work is to provide researchers in CS, and in
other areas of research, with a systematic, tool-supported approach for the
reporting of changes in the replications of their empirical studies.
  Method: Applying DSR, we have developed and validated a composite artifact
consisting of (i) a metamodel of the relevant concepts of replications and
their changes; (ii) templates and linguistic patterns for reporting those
concepts; and (iii) a proof-of-concept model-based software tool that supports
the proposed approach. For its validation, we have carried out a multiple case
study including 9 families of empirical studies from CS and Agrobiology. The 9
families encompass 23 replication studies and 92 replication changes, for which
we have analyzed the suitability of our proposal.
  Results: The multiple case study revealed some initial limitations of our
approach related to threats to experimental validity or context variables.
After several improvement iterations, all the 92 replication changes could be
properly specified, including also their qualitatively estimated effects on
experimental validity across the family of experiments and its corresponding
visualization.
  Conclusions: Our proposal for the specification of replication changes seems
to fit the needs not only of replications in CS, but also in other research
areas. Nevertheless, further research is needed to improve it and to
disseminate its use among the research community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13204v1

  Recognition",2022-07-24T11:26:53Z,"Xuqian Ren, Saihui Hou, Chunshui Cao, Xu Liu, Yongzhen Huang","Gait recognition is instrumental in crime prevention and social security, for
it can be conducted at a long distance to figure out the identity of persons.
However, existing datasets and methods cannot satisfactorily deal with the most
challenging cloth-changing problem in practice. Specifically, the practical
gait models are usually trained on automatically labeled data, in which the
sequences' views and cloth conditions of each person have some restrictions. To
be concrete, the cross-view sub-dataset only has normal walking condition
without cloth-changing, while the cross-cloth sub-dataset has cloth-changing
sequences but only in front views. As a result, the cloth-changing accuracy
cannot meet practical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem as
Realistic Cloth-Changing Gait Recognition (abbreviated as RCC-GR) and we
construct two benchmarks: CASIA-BN-RCC and OUMVLP-RCC, to simulate the above
setting. Furthermore, we propose a new framework called Progressive Feature
Learning that can be applied with off-the-shelf backbones to improve their
performance in RCC-GR. Specifically, in our framework, we design Progressive
Mapping and Progressive Uncertainty to extract cross-view features and then
extract cross-cloth features on the basis. In this way, the feature from the
cross-view sub-dataset can first dominate the feature space and relieve the
uneven distribution caused by the adverse effect from the cross-cloth

effectively improve recognition performance, especially in the cloth-changing
conditions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11720v2

estimators, in a high-dimensional linear regression time series context, where
a regression object $(y_t, X_t) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^p$ is observed
at every time point $t \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. At unknown time points, called
change points, the regression coefficients change, with the jump sizes measured
in $\ell_2$-norm. We provide limiting distributions of the change point
estimators in the regimes where the minimal jump size vanishes and where it
remains a constant. We allow for both the covariate and noise sequences to be
temporally dependent, in the functional dependence framework, which is the
first time seen in the change point inference literature. We show that a
block-type long-run variance estimator is consistent under the functional
dependence, which facilitates the practical implementation of our derived

ClaSP -- Parameter-free Time Series Segmentation,2022-07-28T10:05:53Z,"Arik Ermshaus, Patrick Schäfer, Ulf Leser","The study of natural and human-made processes often results in long sequences
of temporally-ordered values, aka time series (TS). Such processes often
consist of multiple states, e.g. operating modes of a machine, such that state
changes in the observed processes result in changes in the distribution of
shape of the measured values. Time series segmentation (TSS) tries to find such
changes in TS post-hoc to deduce changes in the data-generating process. TSS is
typically approached as an unsupervised learning problem aiming at the
identification of segments distinguishable by some statistical property.
Current algorithms for TSS require domain-dependent hyper-parameters to be set
by the user, make assumptions about the TS value distribution or the types of
detectable changes which limits their applicability. Common hyperparameters are
the measure of segment homogeneity and the number of change points, which are
particularly hard to tune for each data set. We present ClaSP, a novel, highly
accurate, hyper-parameter-free and domain-agnostic method for TSS. ClaSP
hierarchically splits a TS into two parts. A change point is determined by
training a binary TS classifier for each possible split point and selecting the
one split that is best at identifying subsequences to be from either of the
partitions. ClaSP learns its main two model-parameters from the data using two
novel bespoke algorithms. In our experimental evaluation using a benchmark of
107 data sets, we show that ClaSP outperforms the state of the art in terms of
accuracy and is fast and scalable. Furthermore, we highlight properties of
ClaSP using several real-world case studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13987v2

robust SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system, capable of handling
dynamic environments, where objects are moving in front of the robot, and
changing environments, where objects are moved or replaced after the robot has
already mapped the scene. This paper presents Changing-SLAM, a method for
robust Visual SLAM in both dynamic and changing environments. This is achieved
by using a Bayesian filter combined with a long-term data association
algorithm. Also, it employs an efficient algorithm for dynamic keypoints
filtering based on object detection that correctly identify features inside the
bounding box that are not dynamic, preventing a depletion of features that
could cause lost tracks. Furthermore, a new dataset was developed with RGB-D
data especially designed for the evaluation of changing environments on an
object level, called PUC-USP dataset. Six sequences were created using a mobile
robot, an RGB-D camera and a motion capture system. The sequences were designed
to capture different scenarios that could lead to a tracking failure or a map
corruption. To the best of our knowledge, Changing-SLAM is the first Visual
SLAM system that is robust to both dynamic and changing environments, not
assuming a given camera pose or a known map, being also able to operate in real

fractional counting process (NGFCP). A generalization of the NGFCP is obtained
by time-changing the NGCP with an independent inverse subordinator. We derive
the system of governing differential-integral equations for the marginal
distributions of the increments of NGCP, NGFCP and its generalization. Then, we
consider the GCP time-changed by a multistable subordinator and obtain its

and season variations in two images captured in the same scene over a long time
span, presenting critical applications in disaster management, urban
development, etc. In particular, the endless patterns of background changes
require detectors to have a high generalization against unseen environment
variations, making this task significantly challenging. Recent deep
learning-based methods develop novel network architectures or optimization
strategies with paired-training examples, which do not handle the
generalization issue explicitly and require huge manual pixel-level annotation
efforts. In this work, for the first attempt in the CD community, we study the
generalization issue of CD from the perspective of data augmentation and
develop a novel weakly supervised training algorithm that only needs
image-level labels. Different from general augmentation techniques for
classification, we propose the background-mixed augmentation that is
specifically designed for change detection by augmenting examples under the
guidance of a set of background-changing images and letting deep CD models see
diverse environment variations. Moreover, we propose the augmented & real data
consistency loss that encourages the generalization increase significantly. Our

Using Microbenchmark Suites to Detect Application Performance Changes,2022-12-19T14:55:39Z,"Martin Grambow, Denis Kovalev, Christoph Laaber, Philipp Leitner, David Bermbach","Software performance changes are costly and often hard to detect pre-release.
Similar to software testing frameworks, either application benchmarks or
microbenchmarks can be integrated into quality assurance pipelines to detect
performance changes before releasing a new application version. Unfortunately,
extensive benchmarking studies usually take several hours which is problematic
when examining dozens of daily code changes in detail; hence, trade-offs have
to be made. Optimized microbenchmark suites, which only include a small subset
of the full suite, are a potential solution for this problem, given that they
still reliably detect the majority of the application performance changes such
as an increased request latency. It is, however, unclear whether
microbenchmarks and application benchmarks detect the same performance problems

extensive benchmark experiments with both the complete and the optimized
microbenchmark suites of the two time-series database systems InuxDB and
VictoriaMetrics and compare their results to the results of corresponding

Extreme Accretion Events: TDEs and Changing-Look AGN,2022-12-20T15:19:56Z,"S. Komossa, D. Grupe","We present a review of the topics of X-ray stellar tidal disruption events
(TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN). Stars approaching a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be tidally disrupted and accreted. TDEs were
first discovered in the X-ray regime and appear as luminous, giant-amplitude
flares from inactive galaxies. The early X-ray observations with ROSAT also
established the extreme X-ray spectral softness of these events with
temperatures of order 50-100 eV that continues to be seen in the majority of
more recently identified events. While the majority of X-ray TDEs has been
identified from {\it inactive} galaxies and some showed the highest amplitudes
of variability recorded from galaxy cores (amplitudes exceeding factors of
1000--6000), a small fraction of {\it active} galactic nuclei (AGN) has been
found to be highly variable as well. In AGN, this so-called changing-look
phenomenon often comes with a strong change in the optical broad emission
lines, leading to Seyfert-type changes between class 1 and class 2. These two
forms of activity represent the extremes of variability among active and
quiescent galaxies, and have opened up a new window on understanding accretion
physics under extreme conditions. Finally, we introduce the term ``frozen-look
AGN'' to describe systems that show constant line emission despite
strong/dramatic changes in the observed ionizing continuum. These systems are
best explained by strong changes of absorption along our line-of-sight.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10331v1

day-level summary statistics, in which important information of PA

data analysis approach based on Riemann manifolds for modeling PA and its
longitudinal changes. We model smoothed minute-level PA of a day as
one-dimensional Riemann manifolds and longitudinal changes in PA in different

Functional principal component analysis is further adopted to model the

comprehensive analyses on data from two clinical trials: Reach for Health (RfH)

of interventions on longitudinal changes in PA patterns and how different modes
of changes in PA influence weight loss, respectively. The proposed approach

A geometric conjecture about phase transitions,2022-03-07T06:14:49Z,"O. B. Ericok, J. K. Mason","As phenomena that necessarily emerge from the collective behavior of
interacting particles, phase transitions continue to be difficult to predict
using statistical thermodynamics. A recent proposal called the topological
hypothesis suggests that the existence of a phase transition could perhaps be
inferred from changes to the topology of the accessible part of the
configuration space. This paper instead suggests that such a topological change
is often associated with a dramatic change in the configuration space geometry,
and that the geometric change is the actual driver of the phase transition.
More precisely, a geometric change that brings about a discontinuity in the
mixing time required for an initial probability distribution on the
configuration space to reach steady-state is conjectured to be related to the
onset of a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. This conjecture is
tested by evaluating the diffusion diameter and $\epsilon$-mixing time of the
configuration spaces of hard disk and hard sphere systems of increasing size.
Explicit geometries are constructed for the configuration spaces of these

"Generalizing forbidden induced subgraph characterizations of high
  throttling numbers",2022-04-07T22:05:13Z,"Jurgen Kritschgau, Josh Carlson","Zero forcing is a process that models the spread of information throughout a
graph as white vertices are forced to turn blue using a color change rule. The
idea of throttling, introduced in 2013 by Butler and Young, is to optimize the
trade-off between the number of initial blue vertices and the time taken to
force all vertices to become blue. The original throttling number of a graph
minimizes the sum of these two quantities and the product throttling number
minimizes their product. In addition, weighted throttling changes the weights
given to these two quantities when minimizing their sum. Since its
introduction, throttling has expanded to include many variants of zero forcing.
This motivates the study of zero forcing and throttling using abstract color
change rules. Recently, it has been shown that the graphs with high (sum)
throttling numbers are characterized by a finite family of forbidden induced
subgraphs. In this paper, we extend that result to throttling, product
throttling, and weighted throttling using abstract color change rules. To this
end, we define some important families of color change rules and explore their
properties.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03757v1
"Effects of plasma on physical properties of water:
  nanocrystalline-to-amorphous phase transition and improving produce washing",2022-04-12T15:31:11Z,"Jinjie He, Alexander Rabinovich, Dmitri Vainchtein, Alexander Fridman, Christopher Sales, Mikhail N. Shneider","Recently is was discovered in various applications that many physical and
chemical properties of water change their temperature dependence between about
35 and 60 degrees Celsius. In particular, heat conductance, light absorption,
and surface tension all change their temperature dependence. These drastic
changes were associated with water gradually changing its mesoscopic structure:
while at the higher temperatures water is a uniform media (amorphous state), at
the temperatures below transition it consists of many nano-to-micro-scale
clusters (crystalline state). This transition is similar to the second order
phase transition. In the present paper we show that treating water with
non-thermal plasma (adding plasma-created active compounds) can lower the
temperature of the transition and thus cause a significant change in such
physical quantities as surface tension, viscosity, freezing rate, and
wettability and washability. We present analytical estimates of the transition
temperature shift based on the Debya-Huckel theory. We discuss the
produce-washing experiments that illustrate the predicted effects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05888v1

Specifically, we propose a quadratic-form cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic to
test the stability of regression coefficients in high-dimensional linear
models. The test controls type-I error at any desired level and is robust to
temporally dependent observations. We establish its asymptotic distribution
under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically powerful
against multiple change-point alternatives and achieves the optimal detection
boundary for a wide class of high-dimensional models. We further develop an
adaptive procedure to estimate the tuning parameters of the test, making our
method practical in applications. Additionally, we extend our approach to
localize change-points in the regression time series and establish sharp error

real data application in macroeconomics are conducted to demonstrate the
promising performance and practical utility of the proposed test.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03880v2
Enhanced Change-Point Detection in Functional Means,2022-05-09T14:03:14Z,"Shuhao Jiao, Ngai-Hang Chan, Chun-Yip Yau","A new dimension reduction methodology for change-point detection in
functional means is developed in this paper. The major advantage and novelty of
the proposed method is its efficiency in selecting basis functions that capture
the change, or jump, of functional means, leading to higher detection power,
especially when the functions cannot be sufficiently explained by a small
number of basis functions or are contaminated by random noises. The throughly
developed theoretical results demonstrate that, even when the change shrinks to
zero, the proposed approach can still detect the change asymptotically almost
surely. The numerical simulation studies justify the superiority of the
proposed approach to the method based on functional principal components and
the fully functional approach without dimension reduction. An application to

Identifying Moments of Change from Longitudinal User Text,2022-05-11T16:03:47Z,"Adam Tsakalidis, Federico Nanni, Anthony Hills, Jenny Chim, Jiayu Song, Maria Liakata","Identifying changes in individuals' behaviour and mood, as observed via
content shared on online platforms, is increasingly gaining importance. Most
research to-date on this topic focuses on either: (a) identifying individuals

providing equivalent labels at the post level. A disadvantage of such work is
the lack of a strong temporal component and the inability to make longitudinal
assessments following an individual's trajectory and allowing timely
interventions. Here we define a new task, that of identifying moments of change
in individuals on the basis of their shared content online. The changes we

and has many applications, e.g., in predictive maintenance, fraud detection, or

distributions of observations within the stream to each other via hypothesis
testing. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a (semi-)metric on the space of
probability distributions, provides powerful non-parametric two-sample tests on
kernel-enriched domains. In particular, MMD is able to detect any disparity
between distributions under mild conditions. However, classical MMD estimators
suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which renders their direct use for
change detection in data streams impractical. In this article, we propose a new
change detection algorithm, called Maximum Mean Discrepancy on Exponential
Windows (MMDEW), that combines the benefits of MMD with an efficient
computation based on exponential windows. We prove that MMDEW enjoys
polylogarithmic runtime and logarithmic memory complexity and show empirically
that it outperforms the state of the art on benchmark data streams.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12706v4

Flavor Changing Neutral Currents in the Higgs Sector,2022-07-14T09:28:19Z,Marc Sher,"This review considers models with extended Higgs sectors in which there are
tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) mediated by scalars. After

subcavities of the PT-symmetric system. We design a linear fiber Fabry-P\'erot

a function of perturbation-induced changes in the loss within one of the
subcavities of the PT-symmetric system. The coupling strength between the two
subcavities remains unchanged in our proposed sensor. Supported by a
mathematical formulation, we find that the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of

Stochastic methods for slip prediction in a sheared granular system,2022-10-20T22:16:48Z,"Philip Bretz, Lou Kondic, Miro Kramar","We consider a sheared granular system experiencing intermittent dynamics of
stick-slip type via discrete element simulations. The considered setup consists
of a two-dimensional system of soft frictional particles sandwiched between
solid walls, one of which is exposed to a shearing force. The slip events are

describing the system. We show that the measures describing the forces between
the particles provide earlier detection of an upcoming slip event than the
measures based solely on the wall movement. By comparing the detection times
obtained from the considered measures, we observe that a typical slip event
starts with a local change in the force network. However, some local changes do
not spread globally over the force network. For the changes that become global,
we find a sharp critical value for their size. If the size of a global change
exceeds the critical value, then it triggers a slip event; if it does not, then
a much weaker micro-slip follows. Quantification of the changes in the force

ULXs (IC 342 X-1, Cir ULX-5 and NGC 1313 X-1) which appear to show changes
consistent with super-Eddington systems entering a propeller state, and place
rough constraints on the dipole field strength of NGC 1313 X-1 of $<$ 10$^{10}$

Online Kernel CUSUM for Change-Point Detection,2022-11-28T05:08:30Z,"Song Wei, Yao Xie","We present a computationally efficient online kernel Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)
method for change-point detection that utilizes the maximum over a set of
kernel statistics to account for the unknown change-point location. Our
approach exhibits increased sensitivity to small changes compared to existing
kernel-based change-point detection methods, including Scan-B statistic,
corresponding to a non-parametric Shewhart chart-type procedure. We provide
accurate analytic approximations for two key performance metrics: the Average
Run Length (ARL) and Expected Detection Delay (EDD), which enable us to
establish an optimal window length to be on the order of the logarithm of ARL
to ensure minimal power loss relative to an oracle procedure with infinite
memory. Moreover, we introduce a recursive calculation procedure for detection
statistics to ensure constant computational and memory complexity, which is
essential for online implementation. Through extensive experiments on both
simulated and real data, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our
method and validate our theoretical results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15070v5
Airfoil Shape Optimization using Deep Q-Network,2022-11-29T02:54:35Z,"Siddharth Rout, Chao-An Lin","The feasibility of using reinforcement learning for airfoil shape
optimization is explored. Deep Q-Network (DQN) is used over Markov's decision
process to find the optimal shape by learning the best changes to the initial
shape for achieving the required goal. The airfoil profile is generated using
Bezier control points to reduce the number of control variables. The changes in
the position of control points are restricted to the direction normal to the
chordline so as to reduce the complexity of optimization. The process is
designed as a search for an episode of change done to each control point of a
profile. The DQN essentially learns the episode of best changes by updating the
temporal difference of the Bellman Optimality Equation. The drag and lift
coefficients are calculated from the distribution of pressure coefficient along
the profile computed using XFoil potential flow solver. These coefficients are
used to give a reward to every change during the learning process where the
ultimate aim stands to maximize the cumulate reward of an episode.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17189v1
"On the Change of Decision Boundaries and Loss in Learning with Concept
  Drift",2022-12-02T14:58:13Z,"Fabian Hinder, Valerie Vaquet, Johannes Brinkrolf, Barbara Hammer","The notion of concept drift refers to the phenomenon that the distribution
generating the observed data changes over time. If drift is present, machine
learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. Many technologies
for learning with drift rely on the interleaved test-train error (ITTE) as a
quantity which approximates the model generalization error and triggers drift
detection and model updates. In this work, we investigate in how far this
procedure is mathematically justified. More precisely, we relate a change of
the ITTE to the presence of real drift, i.e., a changed posterior, and to a
change of the training result under the assumption of optimality. We support
our theoretical findings by empirical evidence for several learning algorithms,
models, and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01223v1

honeymoon effect in politics. In particular, we constructed a 15-year Twitter

tweets and analyzed them in terms of sentiments, topics, and users. We found
that, while not always, social media tend to show a honeymoon effect at the
change timings of prime minister. The study also revealed that sentiment about
prime ministers differed by topic, indicating that public expectations vary
from one prime minister to another. Furthermore, the user base was largely

beneficial for administrative management.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02827v2
Incentive-Aware Models of Financial Networks,2022-12-13T18:47:30Z,"Akhil Jalan, Deepayan Chakrabarti, Purnamrita Sarkar","Financial networks help firms manage risk but also enable financial shocks to
spread. Despite their importance, existing models of financial networks have
several limitations. Prior works often consider a static network with a simple
structure (e.g., a ring) or a model that assumes conditional independence
between edges. We propose a new model where the network emerges from
interactions between heterogeneous utility-maximizing firms. Edges correspond
to contract agreements between pairs of firms, with the contract size being the
edge weight. We show that, almost always, there is a unique ""stable network.""
All edge weights in this stable network depend on all firms' beliefs.
Furthermore, firms can find the stable network via iterative pairwise
negotiations. When beliefs change, the stable network changes. We show that
under realistic settings, a regulator cannot pin down the changed beliefs that
caused the network changes. Also, each firm can use its view of the network to
inform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs
deviate from their peers. But it cannot identify the deviant belief: increased
risk-seeking is indistinguishable from increased expected profits. Seemingly
minor news may settle the dilemma, triggering significant changes in the
network.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06808v3

E-detectors: a nonparametric framework for sequential change detection,2022-03-07T17:25:02Z,"Jaehyeok Shin, Aaditya Ramdas, Alessandro Rinaldo","Sequential change detection is a classical problem with a variety of
applications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for
example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and
general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change
distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our
procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length
(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian
or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay
following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called
an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental
generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at
consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style
e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve
both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be
instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric
problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many
nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of

"Information criteria for detecting change-points in the Cox proportional
  hazards model",2022-03-30T01:21:59Z,"Ryoto Ozaki, Yoshiyuki Ninomiya","The Cox proportional hazards model, commonly used in clinical trials, assumes
proportional hazards. However, it does not hold when, for example, there is a
delayed onset of the treatment effect. In such a situation, an acute change in
the hazard ratio function is expected to exist. This paper considers the Cox
model with change-points and derives AIC-type information criteria for
detecting those change-points. The change-point model does not allow for
conventional statistical asymptotics due to its irregularity, thus a formal AIC
that penalizes twice the number of parameters would not be analytically
derived, and using it would clearly give overfitting analysis results.
Therefore, we will construct specific asymptotics using the partial likelihood
estimation method in the Cox model with change-points. Based on the original
derivation method for AIC, we propose information criteria that are
mathematically guaranteed. If the partial likelihood is used in the estimation,
information criteria with penalties much larger than twice the number of
parameters could be obtained in an explicit form. Numerical experiments confirm
that the proposed criterion is clearly superior in terms of the original
purpose of AIC, which is to provide an estimate that is close to the true
structure. We also apply the proposed criterion to actual clinical trial data
to indicate that it will easily lead to different results from the formal AIC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15973v2
Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning,2022-03-30T18:14:01Z,"Fan Feng, Biwei Huang, Kun Zhang, Sara Magliacane","Dealing with non-stationarity in environments (e.g., in the transition
dynamics) and objectives (e.g., in the reward functions) is a challenging
problem that is crucial in real-world applications of reinforcement learning
(RL). While most current approaches model the changes as a single shared
embedding vector, we leverage insights from the recent causality literature to
model non-stationarity in terms of individual latent change factors, and causal
graphs across different environments. In particular, we propose Factored
Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a factored adaption approach that
learns jointly both the causal structure in terms of a factored MDP, and a
factored representation of the individual time-varying change factors. We prove
that under standard assumptions, we can completely recover the causal graph
representing the factored transition and reward function, as well as a partial
structure between the individual change factors and the state components.
Through our general framework, we can consider general non-stationary scenarios
with different function types and changing frequency, including changes across
episodes and within episodes. Experimental results demonstrate that FANS-RL
outperforms existing approaches in terms of return, compactness of the latent
state representation, and robustness to varying degrees of non-stationarity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16582v2
The Vision of Self-Evolving Computing Systems,2022-04-14T08:53:23Z,"Danny Weyns, Thomas Baeck, Rene Vidal, Xin Yao, Ahmed Nabil Belbachir","Computing systems are omnipresent; their sustainability has become crucial
for our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of
computing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from
dynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress.
While we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal
with various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system
evolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will
eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward
an arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are
equipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously.
Specifically, when a self-evolving computing system detects conditions outside
its operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an
evolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system
needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture.
During this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are
provided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide
specifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate
the need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art,
outline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and
illustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs
to evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key
research challenges to realize the vision of self-evolving computing systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06825v1

  machine and ensemble learning algorithms",2022-04-20T22:55:59Z,"Basma Khelfa, Ibrahima Ba, Antoine Tordeux","Understanding and predicting highway lane-change maneuvers is essential for
driving modeling and its automation. The development of data-based
lane-changing decision-making algorithms is nowadays in full expansion. We
compare empirically in this article different machine and ensemble learning
classification techniques to the MOBIL rule-based model using trajectory data
of European two-lane highways. The analysis relies on instantaneous
measurements of up to twenty-four spatial-temporal variables with the four
neighboring vehicles on current and adjacent lanes. Preliminary descriptive
investigations by principal component and logistic analyses allow identifying
main variables intending a driver to change lanes. We predict two types of
discretionary lane-change maneuvers: overtaking (from the slow to the fast
lane) and fold-down (from the fast to the slow lane). The prediction accuracy
is quantified using total, lane-changing and lane-keeping errors and associated
receiver operating characteristic curves. The benchmark analysis includes
logistic model, linear discriminant, decision tree, na\""ive Bayes classifier,
support vector machine, neural network machine learning algorithms, and up to
ten bagging and stacking ensemble learning meta-heuristics. If the rule-based

  Updating",2022-05-02T01:02:52Z,"Hongquan Zhu, Xincheng He, Lei Xu","When changing code, developers sometimes neglect updating the related
comments, bringing inconsistent or outdated comments. These comments increase
the cost of program understanding and greatly reduce software maintainability.
Researchers have put forward some solutions, such as CUP and HEBCUP, which
update comments efficiently for simple code changes (i.e. modifying of a single
token), but not good enough for complex ones. In this paper, we propose an
approach, named HatCUP (Hybrid Analysis and Attention based Comment UPdater),
to provide a new mechanism for comment updating task. HatCUP pays attention to
hybrid analysis and information. First, HatCUP considers the code structure
change information and introduces a structure-guided attention mechanism
combined with code change graph analysis and optimistic data flow dependency
analysis. With a generally popular RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture,
HatCUP takes the action of the code edits, the syntax, semantics and structure
code changes, and old comments as inputs and generates a structural
representation of the changes in the current code snippet. Furthermore, instead
of directly generating new comments, HatCUP proposes a new edit or non-edit
mechanism to mimic human editing behavior, by generating a sequence of edit
actions and constructing a modified RNN model to integrate newly developed
components. Evaluation on a popular dataset demonstrates that HatCUP
outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches (CUP) by 53.8%
for accuracy, 31.3% for recall and 14.3% for METEOR of the original metrics.
Compared with the heuristic-based approach (HEBCUP), HatCUP also shows better
overall performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00600v1

a TSDF change measure for each object. A Bayesian update rule that incorporates
both geometric and semantic information is derived to achieve consistent online
map maintenance. To extensively evaluate our approach alongside the

embedding and topic embedding to reduce the optimization space of parameters.
To reveal the changes and roles of embeddings, we introduce \textbf{uniformity}

embedding space. On this basis, we describe how embeddings tend to change
during training via the changes in the uniformity of embeddings. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the impact of changes in embeddings in embedding-based neural

quantum field theory (QFT) interaction, treating the qubit as the system and
cavity QFT as the environment. In particular, we investigate the changes that
occur in the system with a pure initial state and environment during the
decoherence process, with or without energy dissipation, and compare the
results with the case in which the initial state of the system is a mixed state
and thus decoherence is absent. When we choose an interaction Hamiltonian such
that the energy and coherence of the system change simultaneously, the
population change of the system and the energy change are the same when the
initial state is mixed. However, the decoherence terms increase the von Neumann
entropy of the system. In this case the energy change and decoherence of the
system are not independent physical processes. The decoherence process
maintains unitarity. On the other hand, if the interaction Hamiltonian does not
change the energy of the system, there is only the decoherence effect. The
environment will be a distribution in the basis of the displaced number state
and always increases the energy. Landauer's principle is satisfied in both

applications. Nevertheless, most of the existing works focus on designing
advanced network architectures to map the feature difference to the final

difference. In this paper, we study the CD from a different perspective, i.e.,
how to optimize the feature difference to highlight changes and suppress
unchanged regions, and propose a novel module denoted as iterative
difference-enhanced transformers (IDET). IDET contains three transformers: two
transformers for extracting the long-range information of the two images and

  Understanding Network for Hyperspectral Change Detection",2022-07-20T03:26:03Z,"Meiqi Hu, Chen Wu, Liangpei Zhang","The fast development of self-supervised learning lowers the bar learning
feature representation from massive unlabeled data and has triggered a series
of research on change detection of remote sensing images. Challenges in
adapting self-supervised learning from natural images classification to remote
sensing images change detection arise from difference between the two tasks.
The learned patch-level feature representations are not satisfying for the
pixel-level precise change detection. In this paper, we proposed a novel
pixel-level self-supervised hyperspectral spatial-spectral understanding
network (HyperNet) to accomplish pixel-wise feature representation for
effective hyperspectral change detection. Concretely, not patches but the whole
images are fed into the network and the multi-temporal spatial-spectral
features are compared pixel by pixel. Instead of processing the two-dimensional
imaging space and spectral response dimension in hybrid style, a powerful
spatial-spectral attention module is put forward to explore the spatial
correlation and discriminative spectral features of multi-temporal
hyperspectral images (HSIs), separately. Only the positive samples at the same
location of bi-temporal HSIs are created and forced to be aligned, aiming at
learning the spectral difference-invariant features. Moreover, a new similarity
loss function named focal cosine is proposed to solve the problem of imbalanced
easy and hard positive samples comparison, where the weights of those hard
samples are enlarged and highlighted to promote the network training. Six
hyperspectral datasets have been adopted to test the validity and
generalization of proposed HyperNet. The extensive experiments demonstrate the

Robust Change Detection Based on Neural Descriptor Fields,2022-08-01T17:45:36Z,"Jiahui Fu, Yilun Du, Kurran Singh, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, John J. Leonard","The ability to reason about changes in the environment is crucial for robots

during operation so that actions can be followed to ensure a smooth progression
of the working session. However, varying viewing angles and accumulated
localization errors make it easy for robots to falsely detect changes in the
surrounding world due to low observation overlap and drifted object
associations. In this paper, based on the recently proposed category-level
Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs), we develop an object-level online change
detection approach that is robust to partially overlapping observations and
noisy localization results. Utilizing the shape completion capability and
SE(3)-equivariance of NDFs, we represent objects with compact shape codes
encoding full object shapes from partial observations. The objects are then
organized in a spatial tree structure based on object centers recovered from
NDFs for fast queries of object neighborhoods. By associating objects via shape
code similarity and comparing local object-neighbor spatial layout, our
proposed approach demonstrates robustness to low observation overlap and

i.e. a single tumor can exhibit multiple regions that behave differently during
both normal development and also in response to treatment. The large variations
observed in control group tumors can obscure detection of significant
therapeutic effects due to the ambiguity in attributing causes of change. This
can hinder development of effective therapies due to limitations in
experimental design, rather than due to therapeutic failure. An improved method
to model biological variation and heterogeneity in imaging signals is
described. Specifically, Linear Poisson modelling (LPM) evaluates changes in
apparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC) before and 72 hours after radiotherapy,
in two xenograft models of colorectal cancer. The statistical significance of
measured changes are compared to those attainable using a conventional t-test
analysis on basic ADC distribution parameters. When LPMs were applied to
treated tumors, the LPMs detected highly significant changes. The analyses were
significant for all tumors, equating to a gain in power of 4 fold (i.e.
equivelent to having a sample size 16 times larger), compared with the
conventional approach. In contrast, highly significant changes are only
detected at a cohort level using t-tests, restricting their potential use
within personalised medicine and increasing the number of animals required
during testing. Furthermore, LPM enabled the relative volumes of responding and
non-responding tissue to be estimated for each xenograft model. Leave-one-out

cannot come from any of the usual mechanisms, whereas the one remaining
possibility is that the period changes are dominated by the little-known

topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the
human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very
difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature
representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches,
but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian
features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are
ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention
and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as
SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the
appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not
sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is
first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human
semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module
(HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the
visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is
also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the
cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on
the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly,
these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly
outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted

archival IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data in order to characterize its long-term
variability from 2000 to 2022. At least one optical changing-look event
occurred between 2011 and 2014, when the AGN changed from a Type 1.8/1.9
Seyfert to a Type 1. It then faded considerably at all wavelengths, followed by
a dramatic but slow increase in UV/optical brightness between 2021 and 2022.
Near-IR (NIR) spectra in 2022 show prominent broad Paschen lines that are
absent in an archival spectrum from 2010, making NGC 5273 one of the few AGNs
to be observed changing-look in the NIR. We propose that NGC 5273 underwent
multiple changing-look events between 2000 and 2022 -- starting as a Type
1.8/1.9, NGC 5273 changes-look to a Type 1 temporarily in 2002 and again in
2014, reverting back to a Type 1.8/1.9 by 2005 and 2017, respectively. In 2022,
it is again a Type 1 Seyfert. We characterize the changing-look events and
their connection to the dynamic accretion and radiative processes in NGC 5273,

Bayesian Online Change Point Detection for Baseline Shifts,2022-01-07T04:44:25Z,Ginga Yoshizawa,"In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis

online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD

log-variance as a truncated Brownian semi-stationary process. Then, a
deterministic change of measure is applied. The rBergomi model is able to
reproduce observed market SP500 smiles with few parameters, but by virtue of
the deterministic change of measure, produces flat VIX smiles, in contrast to
the upward sloping smiles observed in the market. We use the exact solution for
a certain inhomogeneous fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation to build a
regime switching stochastic change of measure for the rBergomi model that both
yields upward slopping VIX smiles and is equipped with an efficient
semi-analytic Monte Carlo method to price VIX options. The model also allows an
approximation of the VIX, which leads to a significant reduction of the
computational cost of pricing VIX options and futures. A variance reduction

further reduce the computational cost. We verify the capabilities of our model

Understanding the temporal pattern of subway ridership through statistical
models is crucial during such shocks. However, many existing statistical

are utilized to detect the changes of ridership patterns as well as to estimate
the model parameters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data sets of

solvent, gives way to continuous transition and then to further broadened
transitions where the order parameter smoothly becomes zero for sufficiently
poor solvent. This change in the melting behavior is accompanied by a
continuously varying critical exponent along the melting curve, hinting at a

become blue. In 2013, Barioli et al. added a new rule, called hopping, to
existing color change rules in order to demonstrate that the minor monotone
floor of various zero forcing parameters is itself, a zero forcing parameter.
In this paper, we examine the hopping color change rule independently from the
other classic rules. Specifically, we study the hopping forcing number and the
hopping throttling number. We investigate the ways in which these numbers are
related to various graph theory parameters (such as vertex connectivity and
independence number) as well as other zero forcing parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15742v2
"A Formally and Algorithmically Efficient LULC change Model-Building
  Environment",2022-03-31T14:52:02Z,"François-Rémi Mazy, Pierre-Yves Longaretti","The use of spatially explicit land use and land cover (LULC) change models is
widespread in environmental sciences and of interest in public decision-help.
However, it appears that these models suffer from significant biases and
shortcomings, the sources of which can be mathematical, conceptual or
algorithmic. We formalize a modeling environment that distinguishes a
calibration-estimation module and an allocation module. We propose an accurate
calibration-estimation method based on kernel density estimation and detail an
unbiased allocation algorithm. Moreover, a method of evaluation of LULC change
models is presented and allows us to compare them on various fronts (accuracy,
biases, computational efficiency). A case study based on a real land use map
but with known (enforced) transition probabilities is used. It appears that the
estimation error of the methods we propose is substantially improved over the
best existing software. Moreover, these methods require the specification of
very few parameters by the user, and are numerically efficient. This article
presents an overview of our LULC change modeling framework; its various formal

complex, ever-changing environments. We have recently shown that linear
interactions and a switching environment are encoded separately in the mutual
information of the overall system. Here, we first generalize these findings to
a broad class of non-linear interacting models. We find that a new term in the
mutual information appears, quantifying the interplay between non-linear
interactions and environmental changes, and leading to either constructive or
destructive information interference. Furthermore, we show that a higher mutual
information emerges in out-of-equilibrium environments with respect to an
equilibrium scenario. Finally, we generalize our framework to the case of
continuously varying environments. We find that environmental changes can be
mapped exactly into an effective spatially-varying diffusion coefficient,

could dynamically adapt its performance to the overall computation power

By introducing view change mechanism, Balllon is able to dynamically adjust the

  Recent findings: Exogenous fault detection methods can provide a generic

perform active and distributed sensing for detecting changes in the

Specifically, we propose efficient color histogram generation and subsequent
robust localization using score maps. By utilizing the unique equivariance of

statistically significant correlation, however they correlate if the
information is aggregated across patients. In particular, we identify an
anti-correlation: large changes in the viral pool composition come with small
changes in the B-cell receptor repertoire. This result seems to contradict the
naive expectation that when the virus mutates quickly, the immune repertoire
needs to change to keep up. However, we show that the observed anti-correlation
naturally emerges and can be understood in terms of simple population-genetics

TINYCD: A (Not So) Deep Learning Model For Change Detection,2022-07-26T19:28:48Z,"Andrea Codegoni, Gabriele Lombardi, Alessandro Ferrari","In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective change detection model,
called TinyCD. This model has been designed to be faster and smaller than
current state-of-the-art change detection models due to industrial needs.
Despite being from 13 to 140 times smaller than the compared change detection
models, and exposing at least a third of the computational complexity, our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models by at least $1\%$ on both
F1 score and IoU on the LEVIR-CD dataset, and more than $8\%$ on the WHU-CD

exploiting low-level features in a globally temporal and locally spatial way.
In addition, it adopts a new strategy to mix features in the space-time domain
both to merge the embeddings obtained from the Siamese backbones, and, coupled
with an MLP block, it forms a novel space-semantic attention mechanism, the Mix

Using landscape ecology metrics applied to the habitat overlaps between elk and
cattle and between elk and bison, the landscape parameters are varied to
determine how disease propagates throughout the ecosystem as land-use change

model that can be applied to superconductors under uniaxial strain, modelled
via hopping anisotropy, on a square lattice. The results presented here model
an in plane compression along the x-axis, which reduces the lattice symmetry
from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal space group. The effects of
hopping anisotropy on the different types of gap pairings are explored. We show
that changes in Tc are tunable with hopping anisotropy and depend on the
orientation of the gap function in relation to the opening of the Fermi surface

Stability of Syntactic Dialect Classification Over Space and Time,2022-09-11T23:14:59Z,"Jonathan Dunn, Sidney Wong","This paper analyses the degree to which dialect classifiers based on
syntactic representations remain stable over space and time. While previous

Syntactic representations are formulated within the usage-based Construction
Grammar paradigm (CxG). The decay rate of classification performance for each
dialect over time allows us to identify regions undergoing syntactic change.
And the distribution of classification accuracy within dialect regions allows
us to identify the degree to which the grammar of a dialect is internally
heterogeneous. The main contribution of this paper is to show that a rigorous
evaluation of dialect classification models can be used to find both variation

adaptation to another is an important problem in evolutionary biology. For

cross-resistance. In fact, recent experiments on bacteria have suggested that
the cross-resistance of their evolution to various stressful environments can
be predicted by the changes to their transcriptome upon application of stress.
However, there are no studies so far that explain a possible theoretical
relationship between cross-resistance and changes in the transcriptome, which
causes high-dimensional changes to cell phenotype. Here, we show that a
correlation exists between fitness change in stress tolerance evolution and
response to the environment, using a cellular model with a high-dimensional
phenotype and establishing the relationship theoretically. The present results
allow for the prediction of evolution from transcriptome information in
response to different stresses before evolution. The relevance of this to
microbiological evolution experiments is discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07756v2

conventionally associated with a change in the spin polarisation. We instead
show that in hole systems with a $k^3$ spin-orbit interaction, this peak
suppression is due to a change in the scattering of one spin state, not a
change in spin polarisation. We also show that the change in scattering length

evolution remains challenging in existing database systems. Specifically, prior
work often takes ad hoc approaches to schema evolution with 'patches' applied

downtimes for schema changes, sacrificing availability.
  This paper presents Tesseract, a new approach to online and transactional

based on a key observation: in widely used multi-versioned database systems,
schema evolution can be modeled as data modification operations that change the
entire table, i.e., data-definition-as-modification (DDaM). This allows us to
support schema almost 'for free' by leveraging the concurrency control

Diffusion Visual Counterfactual Explanations,2022-10-21T09:35:47Z,"Maximilian Augustin, Valentyn Boreiko, Francesco Croce, Matthias Hein","Visual Counterfactual Explanations (VCEs) are an important tool to understand
the decisions of an image classifier. They are 'small' but 'realistic' semantic
changes of the image changing the classifier decision. Current approaches for
the generation of VCEs are restricted to adversarially robust models and often
contain non-realistic artefacts, or are limited to image classification
problems with few classes. In this paper, we overcome this by generating
Diffusion Visual Counterfactual Explanations (DVCEs) for arbitrary ImageNet
classifiers via a diffusion process. Two modifications to the diffusion process
are key for our DVCEs: first, an adaptive parameterization, whose
hyperparameters generalize across images and models, together with distance
regularization and late start of the diffusion process, allow us to generate
images with minimal semantic changes to the original ones but different
classification. Second, our cone regularization via an adversarially robust
model ensures that the diffusion process does not converge to trivial
non-semantic changes, but instead produces realistic images of the target class
which achieve high confidence by the classifier.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11841v1
"Sequential Gradient Descent and Quasi-Newton's Method for Change-Point
  Analysis",2022-10-21T20:30:26Z,"Xianyang Zhang, Trisha Dawn","One common approach to detecting change-points is minimizing a cost function
over possible numbers and locations of change-points. The framework includes
several well-established procedures, such as the penalized likelihood and
minimum description length. Such an approach requires finding the cost value
repeatedly over different segments of the data set, which can be time-consuming
when (i) the data sequence is long and (ii) obtaining the cost value involves
solving a non-trivial optimization problem. This paper introduces a new
sequential method (SE) that can be coupled with gradient descent (SeGD) and
quasi-Newton's method (SeN) to find the cost value effectively. The core idea
is to update the cost value using the information from previous steps without
re-optimizing the objective function. The new method is applied to change-point
detection in generalized linear models and penalized regression. Numerical
studies show that the new approach can be orders of magnitude faster than the
Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) method without sacrificing estimation accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12235v1

The conventional T-T based SCD model loss optimizes all output tokens equally.
Due to the sparsity of the speaker changes in the training data, the

To mitigate this issue, we use a customized edit-distance algorithm to estimate
the token-level SCD false accept (FA) and false reject (FR) rates during

the FA and FR, focusing the model on accurately predicting speaker changes. We

Efficient Adversarial Input Generation via Neural Net Patching,2022-11-30T08:02:36Z,"Tooba Khan, Kumar Madhukar, Subodh Vishnu Sharma","The generation of adversarial inputs has become a crucial issue in
establishing the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural nets, especially
when they are used in safety-critical application domains such as autonomous

challenges, including scalability issues owing to large-sized networks, and the
generation of adversarial inputs that lack important qualities such as
naturalness and output-impartiality. This problem shares its end goal with the
task of patching neural nets where small changes in some of the network's
weights need to be discovered so that upon applying these changes, the modified
net produces the desirable output for a given set of inputs. We exploit this
connection by proposing to obtain an adversarial input from a patch, with the
underlying observation that the effect of changing the weights can also be
brought about by changing the inputs instead. Thus, this paper presents a novel

Using the radiative transfer code petitRADTrans we also simulate the evolution
of emission and transmission spectra. We investigate the effect of recurring
flares for a total of 11 days covering 515 flares. Results show a significant
change in abundance for some relevant species such as H, OH, and CH$_4$, with
factors going up to 3 orders of magnitude difference with respect to the
preflare abundances. We find a maximum change of $\sim$12 ppm for CH$_4$ in
transmission spectra on GJ876c. These changes in the spectra remain too small

  injury determines post-injury recovery",2022-05-29T13:43:00Z,"James J Gugger, Nishant Sinha, Yiming Huang, Alexa Walter, Cillian Lynch, Justin Morrison, Nathan Smyk, Danielle Sandsmark, Ramon Diaz-Arrastia, Kathryn A Davis","The trajectory of an individual's recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI)
is heterogeneous, with complete recovery in some cases but persistent
disability in others. We hypothesized that changes in structural brain network
abnormalities guide the trajectory of an individual's recovery post-injury. Our
objective was to characterize the variability in recovery post-TBI by
identifying a putative neuroimaging biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI)
in individuals with mild TBI.
  We analyzed 70 T1-weighted and diffusion MRIs longitudinally collected from
35 individuals during the subacute and chronic post-injury periods. Each
individual underwent longitudinal blood work to characterize blood protein
biomarkers of axonal and glial injury and assessment of post-injury recovery in
the subacute and chronic periods. By comparing the MRI data of individual cases
with 35 controls, we estimated the longitudinal change in structural brain
network abnormalities. We validated this proxy measure of TAI with independent
measures of acute intracranial injury estimated from head CT and blood protein
biomarkers.
  Post-injury structural network abnormality was significantly higher than
controls in both subacute and chronic periods, associated with an acute CT
lesion and subacute blood levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (r=0.5,
p=0.008) and neurofilament light (r=0.41, p=0.02). Longitudinal change in
abnormality associated with change in functional outcome status (r=-0.51,
p=0.003) and post-concussive symptoms (BSI: r=0.46, p=0.03; RPQ:r = 0.46,
p=0.02). Brain regions that most closely mapped onto symptom change over time
corresponded to structural network hubs or areas susceptible to neurotrauma.
  Structural network abnormalities might be a biomarker of TAI. Assessing
changes in brain network abnormality might enable better patient stratification
for monitoring recovery after neurotrauma.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14663v1
"fabisearch: A Package for Change Point Detection in and Visualization of
  the Network Structure of Multivariate High-Dimensional Time Series in R",2022-07-06T21:41:15Z,"Martin Ondrus, Ivor Cribben","Change point detection is a commonly used technique in time series analysis,
capturing the dynamic nature in which many real-world processes function. With
the ever increasing troves of multivariate high-dimensional time series data,
especially in neuroimaging and finance, there is a clear need for scalable and
data-driven change point detection methods. Currently, change point detection
methods for multivariate high-dimensional data are scarce, with even less
available in high-level, easily accessible software packages. To this end, we
introduce the R package fabisearch, available on the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN), which implements the factorized binary search (FaBiSearch)
methodology. FaBiSearch is a novel statistical method for detecting change
points in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series
which employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised
dimension reduction and clustering technique. Given the high computational cost
of NMF, we implement the method in C++ code and use parallelization to reduce
computation time. Further, we also utilize a new binary search algorithm to
efficiently identify multiple change points and provide a new method for
network estimation for data between change points. We show the functionality of
the package and the practicality of the method by applying it to a neuroimaging
and a finance data set. Lastly, we provide an interactive, 3-dimensional,
brain-specific network visualization capability in a flexible, stand-alone
function. This function can be conveniently used with any node coordinate
atlas, and nodes can be color coded according to community membership (if
applicable). The output is an elegantly displayed network laid over a cortical
surface, which can be rotated in the 3-dimensional space.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02986v3

of airless planetary bodies is surface alteration by space weathering caused by
irradiation by solar wind and micrometeoroid particles. We aim to evaluate the
damage to the samples from H and laser irradiation and relate it to the
observed alteration in the spectra. We used olivine (OL) and pyroxene (OPX)
pellets irradiated by 5 keV H ions and individual fs laser pulses and measured
their visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectra. We observed the pellets
with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We studied structural,
mineralogical, and chemical modifications in the samples and connected them to
changes in the reflectance spectra. In both minerals, H irradiation induces
partially amorphous sub-surface layers containing small vesicles. In OL
pellets, these vesicles are more tightly packed than in OPX ones. Related
spectral change is mainly in the VIS spectral slope. Changes due to laser
irradiation are mostly dependent on material's melting temperature. Only the
laser-irradiated OL contains nanophase Fe particles, which induce detectable
spectral slope change throughout the measured spectral range. Our results
suggest that spectral changes at VIS-NIR wavelengths are mainly dependent on
thickness of (partially) amorphous sub-surface layers. Amorphisation smooths
microroughness, increasing the contribution of volume scattering and absorption
over surface scattering. Soon after exposure to the space environment, the
appearance of partially amorphous sub-surface layers results in rapid changes
in the VIS spectral slope. In later stages (onset of micrometeoroid
bombardment), we expect an emergence of nanoparticles to also mildly affect the
NIR spectral slope. An increase in dimensions of amorphous layers and vesicles
in the more space-weathered material will only cause band-depth variation and
darkening.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08473v1
"The language of opinion change on social media under the lens of
  communicative action",2022-10-31T11:35:06Z,"Corrado Monti, Luca Maria Aiello, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Francesco Bonchi","Which messages are more effective at inducing a change of opinion in the
listener? We approach this question within the frame of Habermas' theory of
communicative action, which posits that the illocutionary intent of the message
(its pragmatic meaning) is the key. Thanks to recent advances in natural
language processing, we are able to operationalize this theory by extracting
the latent social dimensions of a message, namely archetypes of social intent
of language, that come from social exchange theory. We identify key ingredients
to opinion change by looking at more than 46k posts and more than 3.5M comments
on Reddit's r/ChangeMyView, a debate forum where people try to change each
other's opinion and explicitly mark opinion-changing comments with a special
flag called ""delta"". Comments that express no intent are about 77% less likely
to change the mind of the recipient, compared to comments that convey at least
one social dimension. Among the various social dimensions, the ones that are
most likely to produce an opinion change are knowledge, similarity, and trust,
which resonates with Habermas' theory of communicative action. We also find
other new important dimensions, such as appeals to power or empathetic
expressions of support. Finally, in line with theories of constructive
conflict, yet contrary to the popular characterization of conflict as the bane
of modern social media, our findings show that voicing conflict in the context
of a structured public debate can promote integration, especially when it is
used to counter another conflictive stance. By leveraging recent advances in
natural language processing, our work provides an empirical framework for
Habermas' theory, finds concrete examples of its effects in the wild, and
suggests its possible extension with a more faceted understanding of intent

  with ""Spurious"" Correlations",2022-11-28T18:52:33Z,"Qingyao Sun, Kevin Murphy, Sayna Ebrahimi, Alexander D'Amour","Changes in the data distribution at test time can have deleterious effects on
the performance of predictive models $p(y|x)$. We consider situations where
there are additional meta-data labels (such as group labels), denoted by $z$,
that can account for such changes in the distribution. In particular, we assume
that the prior distribution $p(y, z)$, which models the dependence between the
class label $y$ and the ""nuisance"" factors $z$, may change across domains,
either due to a change in the correlation between these terms, or a change in
one of their marginals. However, we assume that the generative model for
features $p(x|y,z)$ is invariant across domains. We note that this corresponds
to an expanded version of the widely used ""label shift"" assumption, where the
labels now also include the nuisance factors $z$. Based on this observation, we
propose a test-time label shift correction that adapts to changes in the joint
distribution $p(y, z)$ using EM applied to unlabeled samples from the target
domain distribution, $p_t(x)$. Importantly, we are able to avoid fitting a
generative model $p(x|y, z)$, and merely need to reweight the outputs of a

  Absorption Near-Edge Spectra",2022-11-30T16:30:31Z,"Robin Y. Engel, Markus Scholz, Jan O. Schunck, Martin Beye","Absorbing a focused, femtosecond X-ray pulse from a Free-Electron Laser (FEL)
can lead to extreme electronic excitations in solids. This excitation drives
changes of the electronic system over the course of the pulse duration and the
overall absorption of the pulse becomes fluence-dependent. Thus,
fluence-dependent non-linear X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) is
sensitive to the valence excitation dynamics around the Fermi level on the
few-femtosecond timescale. Here we present a simplified rate model based on
well-established physical mechanisms to describe the evolution of the
electronic system. We construct temporal and spatial differentials for the
processes of resonant absorption, stimulated emission, non-resonant absorption,
Auger decay, valence band thermalization and scattering cascades of free
electrons. The phenomenological rate model approach provides a direct
understanding how each physical process contributes to the fluence-dependent
changes observed in XANES measurements. Without accounting for
fluence-dependent changes to the density of states, the model shows good
agreement with experimental results on metallic nickel over more than three
orders of magnitude in fluence, establishing electron redistribution as the
main driver of non-linear absorption changes at high fluences. Although in the
closest vicinity of the resonance, more complex approaches are necessary to
describe remaining discrepancies of the fluence-dependence changes, the
demonstrated capability to describe spectral changes up to extreme fluences
yields fundamental insights into the complex dynamics after intense core

change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational indications
for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal
position within the instability strip. We find period fluctuations in 59
Cepheids with a confidence level of 99%, which are distributed uniformly over
the inspected period range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the
pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid for longer
period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing
changes in their $O-C$ diagrams that are not or not only of evolutionary origin

these effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period

"Improved three-dimensional thermal multiphase lattice Boltzmann model
  for liquid-vapor phase change",2022-01-16T13:00:26Z,"Qing Li, Y. Yu, Kai. H. Luo","Modeling liquid-vapor phase change using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method
has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose
an improved three-dimensional (3D) thermal multiphase LB model for simulating
liquid-vapor phase change. The proposed model has the following features.
First, it is still within the framework of the thermal LB method using a
temperature distribution function and therefore retains the fundamental
advantages of the thermal LB method. Second, in the existing thermal LB models
for liquid-vapor phase change, the finite-difference computations of the
gradient terms $\nabla \cdot u$ and $\nabla T$ usually require special
treatment at boundary nodes, while in the proposed thermal LB model these two
terms are calculated locally. Moreover, in some of the existing thermal LB
models, the error term ${\partial _{{t_0}}}\left( {Tu} \right)$ is eliminated
by adding local correction terms to the collision process in the moment space,
which causes these thermal LB models to be limited to the D2Q9 lattice in two
dimensions and the D3Q15 or D3Q19 lattice in three dimensions. Conversely, the
proposed model does not suffer from such an error term and therefore the
thermal LB equation can be constructed on the D3Q7 lattice, which simplifies
the model and improves the computational efficiency. Numerical simulations are
carried out to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed thermal
multiphase LB model for simulating liquid-vapor phase change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06039v1
Unsupervised Long-Term Person Re-Identification with Clothes Change,2022-02-07T11:55:23Z,"Mingkun Li, Shupeng Cheng, Peng Xu, Xiatian Zhu, Chun-Guang Li, Jun Guo","We investigate unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) with clothes
change, a new challenging problem with more practical usability and scalability
to real-world deployment. Most existing re-id methods artificially assume the
clothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. This
condition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an average
person would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviate
this assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facet
to re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminative
representation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step further
towards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement of
person identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and more
tedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Compared
to conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drastically
more challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the same
person can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and times
with very distinct appearance. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce a novel
Curriculum Person Clustering (CPC) method that can adaptively regulate the
unsupervised clustering criterion according to the clustering confidence.
Experiments on three long-term person re-id datasets show that our CPC
outperforms SOTA unsupervised re-id methods and even closely matches the
supervised re-id models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03087v3

Quantum Lazy Training,2022-02-16T18:24:37Z,"Erfan Abedi, Salman Beigi, Leila Taghavi","In the training of over-parameterized model functions via gradient descent,
sometimes the parameters do not change significantly and remain close to their
initial values. This phenomenon is called lazy training, and motivates
consideration of the linear approximation of the model function around the
initial parameters. In the lazy regime, this linear approximation imitates the
behavior of the parameterized function whose associated kernel, called the
tangent kernel, specifies the training performance of the model. Lazy training
is known to occur in the case of (classical) neural networks with large widths.
In this paper, we show that the training of geometrically local parameterized
quantum circuits enters the lazy regime for large numbers of qubits. More
precisely, we prove bounds on the rate of changes of the parameters of such a
geometrically local parameterized quantum circuit in the training process, and
on the precision of the linear approximation of the associated quantum model
function; both of these bounds tend to zero as the number of qubits grows. We

localization of pulmonary nodules. Modeling lung deformation during VATS for
surgical navigation is desirable, but the mechanisms causing such deformation
are yet not well-understood. In this study, we estimate, quantify and analyze
the lung deformation occurring after a change of patient position during VATS.
We used deformable image registration to estimate the lung deformation between
a preoperative CT (in supine position) and an intraoperative CBCT (in lateral
decubitus position) of six VATS clinical cases. We accounted for sliding motion
between lobes and against the thoracic wall and obtained consistently low
average target registration errors (under 1 mm). We observed large lung
displacement (up to 40 mm); considerable sliding motion between lobes and
against the thoracic wall (up to 30 mm); and localized volume changes

Effect of clustering on primordial black hole microlensing constraints,2022-03-08T17:14:23Z,"Matthew Gorton, Anne M. Green","Stellar microlensing observations tightly constrain compact object dark
matter in the mass range $(10^{-11} - 10^{3}) M_{\odot}$. Primordial Black
Holes (PBHs) form clusters, and it has been argued that these microlensing
constraints are consequently weakened or evaded. For the most commonly studied
PBH formation mechanism, the collapse of large gaussian curvature perturbations
generated by inflation, the clusters are sufficiently extended that the PBHs
within them act as individual lenses. We find that if the typical mass of the
clusters is sufficiently large, $ \gtrsim 10^{6} M_{\odot}$, then the event
duration distribution can deviate significantly from that produced by a smooth
dark matter distribution, in particular at the shortest durations. As a
consequence of this, the probability distribution of the number of observed
events is non-Poissonian, peaking at a lower value, with an extended tail to
large numbers of events. However, for PBHs formed from the collapse of large
inflationary perturbations, the typical cluster is expected to contain $\sim
10^{3}$ PBHs. In this case the effect of clustering is negligibly small, apart
from for the most massive PBHs probed by decade-long stellar microlensing

presence of narrow eclipses, suggesting this is a redback binary system. An
examination of the long-term properties of the modulation over 13 years of LAT
observations indicates that the orbital modulation of the gamma-rays changed
from a simple eclipse before early 2013, to a broader, more easily detected,
quasi-sinusoidal modulation. In addition, the time of the eclipse shifts to
~0.05 later in phase. This change in the orbital modulation properties is,
however, not accompanied by a significant overall change in gamma-ray flux or

that the accretion disk, soft X-ray excess, and the X-ray power-law components
were extremely variable. Additionally, the X-ray power-law flux was correlated
with both the soft excess plus disk and the pure disk fluxes. Our finding shows
that at high flux levels the soft X-ray excess and the disk emission both
provided the seed photons for thermal Comptonization in the hot corona, whereas
at low flux levels where the soft excess was absent, the pure disk emission
alone provided the seed photons. The X-ray power-law photon-index was only
weakly variable ($\Delta{\Gamma_{hot}}\leq0.06$) and it was not well correlated
with the X-ray flux over the declining timescale. On the other hand, we found
that the electron temperature of the corona increased from $\sim22$ to
$\sim200$ keV with decreasing number of seed photons from June 2018 to August
2019. At the same time, the optical depth of the corona decreased from
$\tau_{hot}\sim4$ to $\sim0.7$, and the scattering fraction increased from

them do not scale well to large datasets and require the choice of some (very

multivariate data into a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Since the

one can estimate the probability at any point of the original domain. The
assumption is straightforward: pixels with low estimated probability are
considered anomalies. Our method can describe any multivariate distribution,
makes an efficient use of memory and computational resources, and is
parameter-free. We show the efficiency of the method in experiments involving

"On quasi-nodal spheres and the spin Hall effect: the case of YH3 and
  CaTe",2022-04-30T14:46:12Z,"Rafael Gonzalez-Hernandez, Carlos Pinilla, Bernardo Uribe","Band inversion is a known feature in a wide range of topological insulators
characterized by a change of orbital type around a high-symmetry point close to
the Fermi level. In some cases of band inversion in topological insulators, the
existence of quasinodal spheres has been detected, and the change of orbital
type is shown to be concentrated along these spheres in momentum space. To
understand this phenomenon, we develop a local effective fourfold Hamiltonian
that models the band inversion and reproduces the quasinodal sphere. This model
shows that the signal of the spin Hall conductivity, as well as the change of
orbital type, are both localized on the quasinodal sphere, and moreover, that
these two indicators characterize the topological nature of the material. Using
K-theoretical methods, we show that the change of orbital type parametrized by
an odd clutching function is equivalent to the strong Fu-Kane-Mele invariant.
We corroborate these results with ab initio calculations for the materials YH3
and CaTe, where in both cases the signal of the spin Hall conductivity is
localized on the quasinodal spheres in momentum space. We conclude that a
nontrivial spin Hall conductivity localized on the points of change of orbital
type is a good indicator for topological insulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00284v2

MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ samples, which show different energy gaps at the Dirac point
(DP), are compared with the results of theoretical calculations to find the
conditions for the best agreement between theory and experiment. We have
analyzed different factors which influence the Dirac gap width: (i) the surface
van der Waals (SvdW) distance between the first and second septuple layers
(SLs), (ii) the magnetic moment on Mn atoms, (iii) the spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) strength for the surface Te and Bi atoms and related changes in the
localization of the topological surface states (TSSs). It was shown that all
these factors may change the gap width at the DP in a wide range from 5 to
$\sim$90~meV. We show that the Dirac gap variation is mainly determined by the
corresponding changes in the TSSs spatial distribution. The best agreement
between the presented experimental data (with the Dirac gaps between $\sim$15
and 55~meV) and the calculations takes place for a slightly compressed SvdW
interval (of about -3.5~\% compared to the bulk value) with modified SOC for
surface atoms (that can occur in the presence of various defects in the
near-surface region). We show that upon changing the values of the SvdW
interval and surface SOC strength the TSSs spatial distribution shifts between
the SLs with opposite magnetizations, which leads to a non-monotonic change in
the Dirac gap size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07501v2
"Global solutions with infinitely many blowups in a mean-field neural
  network",2022-05-17T00:31:53Z,"Lorenzo Sadun, Thibaud Taillefumier","We recently introduced idealized mean-field models for networks of
integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like interactions -- the so-called
delayed Poissonian mean-field models. Such models are prone to blowups: for a
strong enough interaction coupling, the mean-field rate of interaction diverges
in finite time with a finite fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously. Due to
the reset mechanism of integrate-and-fire neurons, these blowups can happen
repeatedly, at least in principle. A benefit of considering Poissonian
mean-field models is that one can resolve blowups analytically by mapping the
original singular dynamics onto uniformly regular dynamics via a time change.
Resolving a blowup then amounts to solving the fixed-point problem that
implicitly defines the time change, which can be done consistently for a single
blowup and for nonzero delays. Here we extend this time-change analysis in two
ways: First, we exhibit the existence and uniqueness of explosive solutions
with a countable infinity of blowups in the large interaction regime. Second,
we show that these delayed solutions specify ""physical"" explosive solutions in
the limit of vanishing delays, which in turn can be explicitly constructed. The
first result relies on the fact that blowups are self-sustaining but
nonoverlapping in the time-changed picture. The second result follows from the
continuity of blowups in the time-changed picture and incidentally implies the
existence of periodic solutions. These results are useful to study the
emergence of synchrony in neural network models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08035v1

  Change Detection",2022-05-27T06:08:33Z,"Hao Chen, Wenyuan Li, Song Chen, Zhenwei Shi","Supervised deep learning models depend on massive labeled data.
Unfortunately, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect and annotate
bitemporal samples containing desired changes. Transfer learning from
pre-trained models is effective to alleviate label insufficiency in remote
sensing (RS) change detection (CD). We explore the use of semantic information
during pre-training. Different from traditional supervised pre-training that
learns the mapping from image to label, we incorporate semantic supervision
into the self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Typically, multiple objects
of interest (e.g., buildings) are distributed in various locations in an
uncurated RS image. Instead of manipulating image-level representations via
global pooling, we introduce point-level supervision on per-pixel embeddings to
learn spatially-sensitive features, thus benefiting downstream dense CD. To
achieve this, we obtain multiple points via class-balanced sampling on the
overlapped area between views using the semantic mask. We learn an embedding
space where background and foreground points are pushed apart, and spatially
aligned points across views are pulled together. Our intuition is the resulting
semantically discriminative representations invariant to irrelevant changes
(illumination and unconcerned land covers) may help change recognition. We
collect large-scale image-mask pairs freely available in the RS community for
pre-training. Extensive experiments on three CD datasets verify the
effectiveness of our method. Ours significantly outperforms ImageNet
pre-training, in-domain supervision, and several SSL methods. Empirical results
indicate our pre-training improves the generalization and data efficiency of
the CD model. Notably, we achieve competitive results using 20% training data
than baseline (random initialization) using 100% data. Our code is available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13769v2
Spatial Locality and Granularity Change in Caching,2022-05-28T23:45:52Z,"Nathan Beckmann, Phillip B Gibbons, Charles McGuffey","Caches exploit temporal and spatial locality to allow a small memory to
provide fast access to data stored in large, slow memory. The temporal aspect
of locality is extremely well studied and understood, but the spatial aspect
much less so. We seek to gain an increased understanding of spatial locality by
defining and studying the Granularity-Change Caching Problem. This problem
modifies the traditional caching setup by grouping data items into blocks, such
that a cache can choose any subset of a block to load for the same cost as
loading any individual item in the block.
  We show that modeling such spatial locality significantly changes the caching
problem. This begins with a proof that Granularity-Change Caching is
NP-Complete in the offline setting, even when all items have unit size and all
blocks have unit load cost. In the online setting, we show a lower bound for
competitive ratios of deterministic policies that is significantly worse than
traditional caching. Moreover, we present a deterministic replacement policy
called Item-Block Layered Partitioning and show that it obtains a competitive
ratio close to that lower bound. Moreover, our bounds reveal a new issue
arising in the Granularity-Change Caching Problem where the choice of offline
cache size affects the competitiveness of different online algorithms relative
to one another. To deal with this issue, we extend a prior (temporal) locality
model to account for spatial locality, and provide a general lower bound in
addition to an upper bound for Item-Block Layered Partitioning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14543v1

from 2D image to digital elevation model (DEM) due to the challenge of changes
caused by disasters. This research investigates positional uncertainty of
digital elevation change detection (DECD) caused by different degrees of DEM
complexity and DEM misregistration. Unfortunately, using three-sigma rule
(3{\sigma}R) for DECD is disturbed by accuracy of parameter estimation, which
is affected by the outliers (i.e., varied DEM) from DEM differencing samples.
Hence, to reduce the aforementioned uncertainty of DECD, we propose a new
strategy of quality assurance, adaptively censored three-sigma rule
(AC3{\sigma}R), in which with the samples censored, outliers of global DEM
differencing samples outside the standard deviations of the mean calculated by
moment estimation are iteratively removed. Compared with the 3{\sigma}R and
censored three-sigma rule (C3{\sigma}R) that is similar to AC3{\sigma}R but
without iteration for both simulation and real-world data experiments, the
proposed global AC3{\sigma}R method always exhibits the highest accuracies of
DECD in terms of both the overall accuracies 0.99967, 0.98740 and kappa

the collection of integers representable as norms of integral ideals of $K$,
then a positive proportion of the positive integers $n \in \mathcal{N}_K$ yield
a sign change for the sequence $\{\lambda_f(n)\}_{n \in \mathcal{N}_K}$. More
precisely, for a positive proportion of $n \in \mathcal{N}_K \cap [1,X]$ we
have $\lambda_f(n)\lambda_f(n') < 0$ where $n'$ is the first element of
$\mathcal{N}_K$ greater than $n$ for which $\lambda_f(n') \neq 0$.
  For example, for $K = \mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\mathcal{N}_K = \{m^2+n^2 : m,n \in

Lane-GNN: Integrating GNN for Predicting Drivers' Lane Change Intention,2022-07-02T12:53:56Z,"Hongde Wu, Mingming Liu","Nowadays, intelligent highway traffic network is playing an important role in
modern transportation infrastructures. A variable speed limit (VSL) system can
be facilitated in the highway traffic network to provide useful and dynamic
speed limit information for drivers to travel with enhanced safety. Such system
is usually designed with a steady advisory speed in mind so that traffic can
move smoothly when drivers follow the speed, rather than speeding up whenever
there is a gap and slowing down at congestion. However, little attention has
been given to the research of vehicles' behaviours when drivers left the road
network governed by a VSL system, which may largely involve unexpected
acceleration, deceleration and frequent lane changes, resulting in chaos for
the subsequent highway road users. In this paper, we focus on the detection of
traffic flow anomaly due to drivers' lane change intention on the highway
traffic networks after a VSL system. More specifically, we apply graph
modelling on the traffic flow data generated by a popular mobility simulator,
SUMO, at road segment levels. We then evaluate the performance of lane changing
detection using the proposed Lane-GNN scheme, an attention temporal graph
convolutional neural network, and compare its performance with a temporal
convolutional neural network (TCNN) as our baseline. Our experimental results
show that the proposed Lane-GNN can detect drivers' lane change intention

Robust Counterfactual Explanations for Tree-Based Ensembles,2022-07-06T15:20:45Z,"Sanghamitra Dutta, Jason Long, Saumitra Mishra, Cecilia Tilli, Daniele Magazzeni","Counterfactual explanations inform ways to achieve a desired outcome from a
machine learning model. However, such explanations are not robust to certain
real-world changes in the underlying model (e.g., retraining the model,
changing hyperparameters, etc.), questioning their reliability in several
applications, e.g., credit lending. In this work, we propose a novel strategy
-- that we call RobX -- to generate robust counterfactuals for tree-based
ensembles, e.g., XGBoost. Tree-based ensembles pose additional challenges in
robust counterfactual generation, e.g., they have a non-smooth and
non-differentiable objective function, and they can change a lot in the
parameter space under retraining on very similar data. We first introduce a
novel metric -- that we call Counterfactual Stability -- that attempts to
quantify how robust a counterfactual is going to be to model changes under
retraining, and comes with desirable theoretical properties. Our proposed
strategy RobX works with any counterfactual generation method (base method) and
searches for robust counterfactuals by iteratively refining the counterfactual
generated by the base method using our metric Counterfactual Stability. We
compare the performance of RobX with popular counterfactual generation methods
(for tree-based ensembles) across benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate
that our strategy generates counterfactuals that are significantly more robust

of local outlier factor) over existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02739v2
"A Framework Based on Generational and Environmental Response Strategies
  for Dynamic Multi-objective Optimization",2022-07-06T14:21:36Z,"Qingya Li, Xiangzhi Liu, Fuqiang Wang, Shuai Wang, Peng Zhang, Xiaoming Wu","Due to the dynamics and uncertainty of the dynamic multi-objective
optimization problems (DMOPs), it is difficult for algorithms to find a
satisfactory solution set before the next environmental change, especially for
some complex environments. One reason may be that the information in the
environmental static stage can not be used well in the traditional framework.
In this paper, a novel framework based on generational and environmental
response strategies (FGERS) is proposed, in which response strategies are run
both in the environmental change stage and the environmental static stage to
obtain population evolution information of those both stages. Unlike in the
traditional framework, response strategies are only run in the environmental
change stage. For simplicity, the feed-forward center point strategy was chosen
to be the response strategy in the novel dynamic framework (FGERS-CPS).
FGERS-CPS is not only to predict change trend of the optimum solution set in
the environmental change stage, but to predict the evolution trend of the
population after several generations in the environmental static stage.
Together with the feed-forward center point strategy, a simple memory strategy
and adaptive diversity maintenance strategy were used to form the complete
FGERS-CPS. On 13 DMOPs with various characteristics, FGERS-CPS was compared
with four classical response strategies in the traditional framework.
Experimental results show that FGERS-CPS is effective for DMOPs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04047v1

environment variations in the state space that were not observed during

change in just one variable, such as the background colour, can change many
pixels in the image. The changed pixels can lead to drastic changes in the
agent's latent representation of the image, causing the learned policy to fail.
To learn more robust representations, we introduce TEmporal Disentanglement
(TED), a self-supervised auxiliary task that leads to disentangled image
representations exploiting the sequential nature of RL observations. We find
empirically that RL algorithms utilising TED as an auxiliary task adapt more
quickly to changes in environment variables with continued training compared to
state-of-the-art representation learning methods. Since TED enforces a
disentangled structure of the representation, our experiments also show that
policies trained with TED generalise better to unseen values of variables

paying particular attention to certain specific pixels; a graphical
representation of the magnitude of attention to each pixel is called a
saliency-map. Saliency-maps are used to check the validity of the
classification decision basis, e.g., it is not a valid basis for classification
if a DNN pays more attention to the background rather than the subject of an
image. Semantic perturbations can significantly change the saliency-map. In
this work, we propose the first verification method for attention robustness,
i.e., the local robustness of the changes in the saliency-map against
combinations of semantic perturbations. Specifically, our method determines the
range of the perturbation parameters (e.g., the brightness change) that
maintains the difference between the actual saliency-map change and the
expected saliency-map change below a given threshold value. Our method is based
on activation region traversals, focusing on the outermost robust boundary for
scalability on larger DNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method

Changepoint Detection for Real-Time Spectrum Sharing Radar,2022-06-30T18:55:48Z,"Samuel Haug, Austin Egbert, Robert J. Marks II, Charles Baylis, Anthony Martone","Radar must adapt to changing environments, and we propose changepoint
detection as a method to do so. In the world of increasingly congested radio
frequencies, radars must adapt to avoid interference. Many radar systems employ
the prediction action cycle to proactively determine transmission mode while
spectrum sharing. This method constructs and implements a model of the
environment to predict unused frequencies, and then transmits in this predicted
availability. For these selection strategies, performance is directly reliant
on the quality of the underlying environmental models. In order to keep up with
a changing environment, these models can employ changepoint detection.
Changepoint detection is the identification of sudden changes, or changepoints,
in the distribution from which data is drawn. This information allows the
models to discard ""garbage"" data from a previous distribution, which has no
relation to the current state of the environment. In this work, bayesian online
changepoint detection (BOCD) is applied to the sense and predict algorithm to
increase the accuracy of its models and improve its performance. In the context
of spectrum sharing, these changepoints represent interferers leaving and
entering the spectral environment. The addition of changepoint detection allows
for dynamic and robust spectrum sharing even as interference patterns change
dramatically. BOCD is especially advantageous because it enables online
changepoint detection, allowing models to be updated continuously as data are
collected. This strategy can also be applied to many other predictive
algorithms that create models in a changing environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06409v1

mobility restrictions during the pandemic have forced people to substantially
reduce urban physical encounters, raising questions on the social implications
of such behavioral changes. In this paper, we study how the income diversity of
urban encounters have changed during different periods throughout the pandemic,
using a large-scale, privacy-enhanced mobility dataset of more than one million
anonymized mobile phone users in four large US cities, collected across three
years spanning before and during the pandemic. We find that the diversity of
urban encounters have substantially decreased (by 15% to 30%) during the
pandemic and has persisted through late 2021, even though aggregated mobility
metrics have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Counterfactual analyses show
that while the reduction of outside activities (higher rates of staying at
home) was a major factor that contributed to decreased diversity in the early
stages of the pandemic, behavioral changes including lower willingness to
explore new places and changes in visitation preferences further worsened the
long-term diversity of encounters. Our findings suggest that the pandemic could
have long-lasting negative effects on urban income diversity, and provide
implications for managing the trade-off between the stringency of COVID-19

of this paper is on the lane change application where DMS can use the local
object map to automatically identify closest TV in adjacent lane in the
direction of HV's intended lane change and inform the TV via a DIM. Within DMS,
the paper proposes a TV recognition algorithm for lane change application that
utilizes the HV's Path History (PH) to accurately determine the closest TV that
could potentially benefit from receiving a DIM from HV. Finally, DMS is also
shown to act as an advanced warning system by providing extra time and space

decomposes the source signal into the regressed signal and changed signal, and
requires the regressed signal have the same spectral property as the target

"A polymer brush theory for quantitative prediction of maximum height
  change between dry and wet states",2022-08-14T18:10:46Z,Jiawei Yang,"Polymer brushes can grow on almost any solid surface, and by design, exhibit
diverse properties and functionalities, thus they have been widely used in many
emerging applications in engineering, energy, and medicine. In particular, some
applications such as actuation, molecule release, and friction switch require
the polymer brushes to change their heights between dry and wet states, and
maximizing such height change is critical for the optimal performance of these
applications. While scaling laws have long been proposed to qualitatively
determine brush heights, a theory that can quantitatively predict brush heights
and conditions for maximizing brush height change is still lacking yet is
valuable for the practical design of polymer brushes. Here, we take a
thermodynamic approach to formulate a polymer brush theory to calculate brush
heights at various conditions of graft area, degree of polymerization (DP), and
solvent qualities. Our model consists of two parts-the freely-jointed chain
model to describe the elasticity of brushes and the Flory-Rehner model to
describe the mixing of brushes and solvents. The calculated brush heights at
both dry and wet states fairly agree with the experimental data from the
literature. The calculated brush heights are further used to determine the
conditions for the maximum brush height change. Our theory can guide the design
of polymer brushes for optimal functional performance in various applications
and also can couple with other models to describe more complex behaviors of
polymer brushes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06892v1
IDAN: Image Difference Attention Network for Change Detection,2022-08-17T13:46:13Z,"Hongkun Liu, Zican Hu, Qichen Ding, Xueyun Chen","Remote sensing image change detection is of great importance in disaster
assessment and urban planning. The mainstream method is to use encoder-decoder
models to detect the change region of two input images. Since the change
content of remote sensing images has the characteristics of wide scale range
and variety, it is necessary to improve the detection accuracy of the network
by increasing the attention mechanism, which commonly includes:
Squeeze-and-Excitation block, Non-local and Convolutional Block Attention
Module, among others. These methods consider the importance of different
location features between channels or within channels, but fail to perceive the
differences between input images. In this paper, we propose a novel image
difference attention network (IDAN). In the image preprocessing stage, we use a
pre-training model to extract the feature differences between two input images
to obtain the feature difference map (FD-map), and Canny for edge detection to
obtain the edge difference map (ED-map). In the image feature extracting stage,
the FD-map and ED-map are input to the feature difference attention module and
edge compensation module, respectively, to optimize the features extracted by
IDAN. Finally, the change detection result is obtained through the feature
difference operation. IDAN comprehensively considers the differences in
regional and edge features of images and thus optimizes the extracted image
features. The experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score of IDAN
improves 1.62% and 1.98% compared to the baseline model on WHU dataset and
LEVIR-CD dataset, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08292v1

  and Baldwin effect",2022-08-22T07:24:25Z,"Hubing Xiao, Junhui Fan, Zhihao Ouyang, Liangjun Hu, Guohai Chen, Liping Fu, Shaohua Zhang","It is known that the blazar jet emissions are dominated by non-thermal
radiation while the accretion disk jets are normally dominated by thermal
emission. In this work, our aim is to study the connection between the two
types of emission by investigating the correlation between the blazar emission
line intensity property, which embodies the nature of accretion disk, and the
$\gamma$-ray flux property, which is the representative of jet emission. We
compiled a sample of 656 blazars with available emission line equivalent widths
($EW$), the GeV $\gamma$-ray flux, and the SED information from the literature.
In this work, we found 55 previous BCUs are now identified as FSRQs, and found
52 Changing-look blazars based on their $EW$ and 45 of them are newly
confirmed. These Changing-look blazars have a larger accretion ratio (${\dot
M}/{\dot M}_{\rm Edd}$) than BL Lac objects. In addition, we suggest that the
lower synchrotron peak blazars (LSPs) could be the source of Changing-look
blazars because 90.7\% of the Changing-look blazars in this work are confirmed
as LSPs. An anti-correlation between $EW$ and continuum intensity, the
so-called global Baldwin effect (BEff) has been confirmed. We suggest the
steeper global BEff observed for blazar than for radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei (RQ-AGNs) is caused by the inverse Compton scattering of
broad-emission-line photons. This interpretation is further supported by the
positive correlation between the emission line $EW$ and intrinsic inverse
Compton luminosity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10104v1
Event-Triggered Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization,2022-08-23T07:50:52Z,"Paul Brunzema, Alexander von Rohr, Friedrich Solowjow, Sebastian Trimpe","We consider the problem of sequentially optimizing a time-varying objective
function using time-varying Bayesian optimization (TVBO). Current approaches to
TVBO require prior knowledge of a constant rate of change to cope with stale
data arising from time variations. However, in practice, the rate of change is
usually unknown. We propose an event-triggered algorithm, ET-GP-UCB, that
treats the optimization problem as static until it detects changes in the
objective function and then resets the dataset. This allows the algorithm to
adapt online to realized temporal changes without the need for exact prior
knowledge. The event trigger is based on probabilistic uniform error bounds
used in Gaussian process regression. We derive regret bounds for adaptive
resets without exact prior knowledge of the temporal changes and show in
numerical experiments that ET-GP-UCB outperforms competing GP-UCB algorithms on
both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that ET-GP-UCB is
readily applicable without extensive hyperparameter tuning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10790v6
Motif-Based Visual Analysis of Dynamic Networks,2022-08-25T08:27:36Z,"Eren Cakmak, Johannes Fuchs, Dominik Jäckle, Tobias Schreck, Ulrik Brandes, Daniel Keim","Many data analysis problems rely on dynamic networks, such as social or
communication network analyses. Providing a scalable overview of long sequences
of such dynamic networks remains challenging due to the underlying large-scale
data containing elusive topological changes. We propose two complementary
pixel-based visualizations, which reflect occurrences of selected sub-networks
(motifs) and provide a time-scalable overview of dynamic networks: a
network-level census (motif significance profiles) linked with a node-level
sub-network metric (graphlet degree vectors) views to reveal structural
changes, trends, states, and outliers. The network census captures
significantly occurring motifs compared to their expected occurrences in random
networks and exposes structural changes in a dynamic network. The sub-network
metrics display the local topological neighborhood of a node in a single
network belonging to the dynamic network. The linked pixel-based visualizations
allow exploring motifs in different-sized networks to analyze the changing
structures within and across dynamic networks, for instance, to visually
analyze the shape and rate of changes in the network topology. We describe the
identification of visual patterns, also considering different reordering
strategies to emphasize visual patterns. We demonstrate the approach's

"Anticipated versus Actual Effects of Platform Design Change: A Case
  Study of Twitter's Character Limit",2022-08-30T16:59:19Z,"Kristina Gligorić, Justyna Częstochowska, Ashton Anderson, Robert West","The design of online platforms is both critically important and challenging,
as any changes may lead to unintended consequences, and it can be hard to
predict how users will react. Here we conduct a case study of a particularly
important real-world platform design change: Twitter's decision to double the
character limit from 140 to 280 characters to soothe users' need to ''cram'' or
''squeeze'' their tweets, informed by modeling of historical user behavior. In
our analysis, we contrast Twitter's anticipated pre-intervention predictions
about user behavior with actual post-intervention user behavior: Did the
platform design change lead to the intended user behavior shifts, or did a gap
between anticipated and actual behavior emerge? Did different user groups react
differently? We find that even though users do not ''cram'' as much under 280
characters as they used to under 140 characters, emergent ``cramming'' at the
new limit seems to not have been taken into account when designing the platform
change. Furthermore, investigating textual features, we find that, although
post-intervention ''crammed'' tweets are longer, their syntactic and semantic
characteristics remain similar and indicative of ''squeezing''. Applying the
same approach as Twitter policy-makers, we create updated counterfactual
estimates and find that the character limit would need to be increased further
to reduce cramming that re-emerged at the new limit. We contribute to the rich
literature studying online user behavior with an empirical study that reveals a
dynamic interaction between platform design and user behavior, with immediate
policy and practical implications for the design of socio-technical systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14392v1

been a topic of recurrent attention in the fields of machine learning and
computer vision over the past decades. A visual anomaly or change detection
algorithm identifies regions of an image that differ from a reference image or
dataset. The majority of existing approaches focus on anomaly or fault
detection in a specific class of images or environments, while general purpose
visual anomaly detection algorithms are more scarce in the literature. In this
paper, we propose a comprehensive deep learning framework for detecting
anomalies and changes in a priori unknown environments after a reference
dataset is gathered, and without need for retraining the model. We use the
SuperPoint and SuperGlue feature extraction and matching methods to detect
anomalies based on reference images taken from a similar location and with
partial overlapping of the field of view. We also introduce a self-calibrating
method for the proposed model in order to address the problem of sensitivity to
feature matching thresholds and environmental conditions. To evaluate the
proposed framework, we have used a ground robot system for the purpose of
reference and query data collection. We show that high accuracy can be obtained
using the proposed method. We also show that the calibration process enhances

Evaluating Temporal Patterns in Applied Infant Affect Recognition,2022-09-07T23:29:15Z,"Allen Chang, Lauren Klein, Marcelo R. Rosales, Weiyang Deng, Beth A. Smith, Maja J. Matarić","Agents must monitor their partners' affective states continuously in order to
understand and engage in social interactions. However, methods for evaluating
affect recognition do not account for changes in classification performance
that may occur during occlusions or transitions between affective states. This
paper addresses temporal patterns in affect classification performance in the
context of an infant-robot interaction, where infants' affective states
contribute to their ability to participate in a therapeutic leg movement
activity. To support robustness to facial occlusions in video recordings, we
trained infant affect recognition classifiers using both facial and body
features. Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of our best-performing models
to evaluate how performance changed over time as the models encountered missing
data and changing infant affect. During time windows when features were
extracted with high confidence, a unimodal model trained on facial features
achieved the same optimal performance as multimodal models trained on both
facial and body features. However, multimodal models outperformed unimodal
models when evaluated on the entire dataset. Additionally, model performance
was weakest when predicting an affective state transition and improved after
multiple predictions of the same affective state. These findings emphasize the
benefits of incorporating body features in continuous affect recognition for
infants. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating variability in model
performance both over time and in the presence of missing data when applying
affect recognition to social interactions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03496v1

  History and Shadows of Galactic Black Holes",2022-09-10T14:05:29Z,"V. K. Oikonomou, Pyotr Tsyba, Olga Razina","In this short review, we discuss how Earth's climatological and geological
history and also how the shadows of galactic black holes might reveal our
Universe's past evolution. Specifically we point out that a pressure
singularity that occurred in our Universe's past might have left its imprint on
Earth's geological and climatological history and on the shadows of
cosmological black holes. Our approach is based on the fact that the $H_0$
tension problem may be resolved if some sort of abrupt physics change occurred
in our Universe $70-150\,$Myrs ago, an abrupt change that deeply affected the
Cepheid parameters. We review how such an abrupt physics change might have been
caused in our Universe by a smooth passage of it through a pressure finite-time
singularity. Such finite-time singularities might occur in modified gravity and
specifically in $F(R)$ gravity, so we show how modified gravity might drive
this type of evolution, without resorting to peculiar cosmic fluids or scalar
fields. The presence of such a pressure singularity can distort the elliptic
trajectories of bound objects in the Universe, causing possible geological and
climatological changes on Earth, if its elliptic trajectory around the Sun
might have changed. Also, such a pressure singularity affects directly the
circular photon orbits around supermassive galactic black holes existing at
cosmological redshift distances, thus the shadows of some cosmological black
holes at redshifts $z\leq 0.01$, might look different in shape, compared with
the SgrA* and M87* supermassive black holes. This feature however can be
checked experimentally in the very far future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04669v1

anomalies. These might include bad data caused by gross measurement errors or
communication system failures. Sudden changes in load or generation can be
considered as anomaly depending on the implemented state estimation method.
Additionally, considering power grid as a cyber physical system, state
estimation becomes vulnerable to false data injection attacks. The existing
methods for anomaly classification cannot accurately classify (discriminate
between) the above mentioned three types of anomalies, especially when it comes
to discrimination between sudden load changes and false data injection attacks.
This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting anomaly presence, classifying
the anomaly type and identifying the origin of the anomaly, i.e., measurements
that contain gross errors in case of bad data, or buses associated with loads
experiencing a sudden change, or state variables targeted by false data
injection attack. The algorithm combines analytical and machine learning (ML)
approaches. The first stage exploits an analytical approach to detect anomaly
presence by combining $\chi^2$-test and anomaly detection index. The second
stage utilizes ML for classification of anomaly type and identification of its
origin, with particular reference to discrimination between sudden load changes
and false data injection attacks. The proposed ML based method is trained to be
independent of the network configuration which eliminates retraining of the
algorithm after network topology changes. The results obtained by implementing
the proposed algorithm on IEEE 14 bus test system demonstrate the accuracy and
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12629v2
"Orbits and action changes during star-clump encounters responsible for
  the origin of exponential discs in dwarf galaxies",2022-10-02T23:29:13Z,"Jian Wu, Curtis Struck, Bruce G. Elmegreen, Elena D'Onghia","Previous studies found that stellar scattering by massive clumps can lead to
the formation of exponential profiles in galaxy discs, but details on how a
star is moved around have not been fully explained. We use a GADGET-2
simulation where an exponential profile forms from an initially Gaussian disc
in about 4 Gyr for a low-mass galaxy like a dwarf irregular. We find that
nearly all large angular momentum changes of stars are caused by star-clump
encounters with the closest approach less than 0.5 kpc. During star-clump
encounters, stars may increase their random motions, resulting in an increase
in the average radial and vertical actions of the whole stellar population. The
angular momentum change and the radial action change of an individual star are
influenced by the direction from which the star approaches a clump. A star
initially at a higher galactic radius relative to the scattering clump usually
gets pulled inwards and loses its angular momentum during the encounter, and
one at a lower radius tends to shift outwards and gains angular momentum. The
increase in the radial action is the largest if a star encounters a clump from
the azimuthal direction, and is the smallest from a radial approach. The
angular momentum change due to encounters has an inward bias when the clump
profile has a steep radial decline, and a shallow decline can make the bias
outwards. The stellar profile evolution towards an exponential seems to occur
regardless of the direction of the bias.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00651v1
Long-Term Localization using Semantic Cues in Floor Plan Maps,2022-10-04T08:30:45Z,"Nicky Zimmerman, Tiziano Guadagnino, Xieyuanli Chen, Jens Behley, Cyrill Stachniss","Lifelong localization in a given map is an essential capability for
autonomous service robots. In this paper, we consider the task of long-term
localization in a changing indoor environment given sparse CAD floor plans. The
commonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and
time of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are
updated when significant changes occur. We address the difficulty of
localization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is
low due to the sparsity of the CAD map and the changing environment. To
overcome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly
present in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using RGB
cameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an
easy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated
into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates
on 2D LiDAR scans and camera data. We provide a long-term localization solution
and a semantic map format, for environments that undergo changes to their
interior structure and detailed geometric maps are not available. We evaluate
our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an
office environment, taken weeks apart. The experiments suggest that our
approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We

of operative action captioning that estimates and verbalizes the actions to be
taken by the system in a human-assisting domain. We constructed a system that
outputs a verbal description of a possible operative action that changes the
current state to the given target state. We collected a dataset consisting of
two images as observations, which express the current state and the state
changed by actions, and a caption that describes the actions that change the
current state to the target state, by crowdsourcing in daily life situations.
Then we constructed a system that estimates operative action by a caption.
Since the operative action's caption is expected to contain some state-changing
actions, we use scene-graph prediction as an auxiliary task because the events
written in the scene graphs correspond to the state changes. Experimental
results showed that our system successfully described the operative actions
that should be conducted between the current and target states. The auxiliary

Online testing is one of the promising modes for testing such systems with
their application environments (simulated or real) in a closed loop taking into
account the continuous interaction between the systems and their environments.
However, the environmental variables (e.g., lighting conditions) that might
change during the systems' operation in the real world, causing the DES to
violate requirements (safety, functional), are often kept constant during the
execution of an online test scenario due to the two major challenges: (1) the
space of all possible scenarios to explore would become even larger if they
changed and (2) there are typically many requirements to test simultaneously.
In this paper, we present MORLOT (Many-Objective Reinforcement Learning for
Online Testing), a novel online testing approach to address these challenges by
combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and many-objective search. MORLOT
leverages RL to incrementally generate sequences of environmental changes while
relying on many-objective search to determine the changes so that they are more
likely to achieve any of the uncovered objectives. We empirically evaluate
MORLOT using CARLA, a high-fidelity simulator widely used for autonomous
driving research, integrated with Transfuser, a DNN-enabled ADS for end-to-end

  electron ionization in strongly driven atoms",2022-10-31T15:23:03Z,"Georgios Petros Katsoulis, Matthew Benjamin Peters, Agapi Emmanouilidou","We employ a recently developed three-dimensional semiclassical model to
identify nondipole effects in triple ionization of Ne driven by infrared laser
pulses at intensities where electron-electron correlation prevails. This model
fully accounts for the Coulomb interaction of each electron with the core and
avoids artificial autoionization by employing effective Coulomb potentials to
describe the interaction between bound electrons (ECBB). Using the ECBB model,
we identify a prominent signature of nondipole effects. Namely, the component
along the direction of light propagation of the average sum of the final
electron momenta is large and positive. That is, we identify a positive
momentum offset, absent in the dipole approximation. We find that this positive
momentum offset stems mostly from the momentum change due to the magnetic
field. To further understand this momentum change, we also develop a simple
model for the motion of an electron inside an electromagnetic field. This
simple model accounts for the effect of the Coulomb forces only as a sharp
change in the momentum of the electron during recollision. We show that the
momentum change due to the magnetic field is related with the sharp change in
momentum during recollision for the recolliding electron as well as with the
time of recollision for both the recolliding and bound electrons. Hence, we
demonstrate that the final electron momentum offset probes the strength of a
recollision and hence the degree of correlation in multielectron ionization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17394v2

demonstrate that the physical properties of ErCo$_{2}$ are significantly
changed by atomization and subsequent thermal annealing. In the as-atomized

Injectable Bubbles for Physiological Pressure Measurement,2022-11-19T03:45:21Z,Prashant Pandey,"Microbubbles - used as contrast agents in ultrasound imaging - are important
tools in biomedical research, having been used together with ultrasound to
develop significant diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. It has been
suggested that the dynamic behaviour of microbubbles is dependent on the
surrounding fluid's ambient (hydrostatic) pressure, and the potential to
non-invasively determine blood pressure has numerous medical applications. To
study this dependence, a computational mathematical model was created based on
Marmottant's dynamic model of a microbubble. A pulse inversion (PI) protocol
was incorporated into the model to emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the
microbubble's response. The mathematical model was also used to assess the
sensitivity of the microbubbles to undesirable changes in parameters other than
the ambient pressure. It found that a variation in the microbubble's initial
radius and surface tension would cause the most significant changes in signal
energy and hence pose a risk to ambient pressure measurements. To test the
practicality of detecting a change in the dynamic behaviour of microbubbles, in
vitro experiments were designed and carried out using clinically available
contrast agent with two different ultrasound systems. The experiments, while
possessing certain limitations, confirmed that there is a change in
microbubbles' dynamic behaviour when the ambient pressure is varied, in cases
by as little as 7.36 mmHg (981 Pa - a 0.98% change in atmospheric pressure).
The experimental results establish a proof-of-principle that future
experimental work can build upon to verify the mathematical model, and hence
aid in developing a non-invasive blood pressure measurement procedure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12344v1

However, the performance of these models is still lower for the
clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the
person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As
clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a

that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched

stainless steel were investigated by XANES, EXAFS, EDS, and STEM. For
coarse-grained fcc-structured Ti1-xAlxN coatings, with 0 \leq x \leq 0.62, the
XANES spectrum changes with Al-content. XANES Ti 1s line-scans across the rake
face of the worn samples reveals that TiN-enriched domains have formed during
turning in Ti0.47Al0.53N and Ti0.38Al0.62N samples as a result of spinodal
decomposition. The XANES spectra reveal the locations on the tool in which the
most TiN-rich domains have formed, indicating which part of the tool-chip
contact area that experienced the highest temperature during turning. Changes
in the pre-edge features in the XANES spectra reveal that structural changes
occur also in the w-TiAlN phase in fine-grained Ti0.38Al0.62N during turning.
EDS shows that Cr and Fe from the steel adhere to the tool rake face during
machining. Cr 1s and Fe 1s XANES show that Cr is oxidized in the end of the
contact length while the adhered Fe retains in the same fcc-structure as that
of the 316L stainless steel.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04169v1
"Scene Change Detection Using Multiscale Cascade Residual Convolutional
  Neural Networks",2022-12-20T16:48:51Z,"Daniel F. S. Santos, Rafael G. Pires, Danilo Colombo, João P. Papa","Scene change detection is an image processing problem related to partitioning
pixels of a digital image into foreground and background regions. Mostly,
visual knowledge-based computer intelligent systems, like traffic monitoring,
video surveillance, and anomaly detection, need to use change detection
techniques. Amongst the most prominent detection methods, there are the
learning-based ones, which besides sharing similar training and testing
protocols, differ from each other in terms of their architecture design
strategies. Such architecture design directly impacts on the quality of the
detection results, and also in the device resources capacity, like memory. In
this work, we propose a novel Multiscale Cascade Residual Convolutional Neural
Network that integrates multiscale processing strategy through a Residual
Processing Module, with a Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network.
Experiments conducted on two different datasets support the effectiveness of
the proposed approach, achieving average overall
$\boldsymbol{F\text{-}measure}$ results of $\boldsymbol{0.9622}$ and
$\boldsymbol{0.9664}$ over Change Detection 2014 and PetrobrasROUTES datasets

The Role of Author Identities in Peer Review,2022-12-31T15:26:43Z,Nihar B. Shah,"There is widespread debate on whether to anonymize author identities in peer
review. The key argument for anonymization is to mitigate bias, whereas
arguments against anonymization posit various uses of author identities in the
review process. The Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2023
conference adopted a middle ground by initially anonymizing the author
identities from reviewers, revealing them after the reviewer had submitted
their initial reviews, and allowing the reviewer to change their review
subsequently. We present an analysis of the reviews pertaining to the
identification and use of author identities. Our key findings are: (I) A
majority of reviewers self-report not knowing and being unable to guess the
authors' identities for the papers they were reviewing. (II) After the initial
submission of reviews, 7.1% of reviews changed their overall merit score and
3.8% changed their self-reported reviewer expertise. (III) There is a very weak
and statistically insignificant correlation of the rank of authors'
affiliations with the change in overall merit; there is a weak but
statistically significant correlation with respect to change in reviewer
expertise. We also conducted an anonymous survey to obtain opinions from
reviewers and authors. The main findings from the 200 survey responses are: (i)
A vast majority of participants favor anonymizing author identities in some
form. (ii) The ""middle-ground"" initiative of ITCS 2023 was appreciated. (iii)
Detecting conflicts of interest is a challenge that needs to be addressed if
author identities are anonymized. Overall, these findings support anonymization
of author identities in some form (e.g., as was done in ITCS 2023), as long as
there is a robust and efficient way to check conflicts of interest.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00221v2
"DeepRelease: Language-agnostic Release Notes Generation from Pull
  Requests of Open-source Software",2022-01-18T03:42:42Z,"Huaxi Jiang, Jie Zhu, Li Yang, Geng Liang, Chun Zuo","The release note is an essential software artifact of open-source software
that documents crucial information about changes, such as new features and bug
fixes. With the help of release notes, both developers and users could have a
general understanding of the latest version without browsing the source code.
However, it is a daunting and time-consuming job for developers to produce
release notes. Although prior studies have provided some automatic approaches,
they generate release notes mainly by extracting information from code changes.
This will result in language-specific and not being general enough to be
applicable. Therefore, helping developers produce release notes effectively
remains an unsolved challenge. To address the problem, we first conduct a
manual study on the release notes of 900 GitHub projects, which reveals that
more than 54% of projects produce their release notes with pull requests. Based
on the empirical finding, we propose a deep learning based approach named
DeepRelease (Deep learning based Release notes generator) to generate release
notes according to pull requests. The process of release notes generation in
DeepRelease includes the change entries generation and the change category
(i.e., new features or bug fixes) generation, which are formulated as a text
summarization task and a multi-class classification problem, respectively.
Since DeepRelease fully employs text information from pull requests to
summarize changes and identify the change category, it is language-agnostic and
can be used for projects in any language. We build a dataset with over 46K
release notes and evaluate DeepRelease on the dataset. The experimental results
indicate that DeepRelease outperforms four baselines and can generate release
notes similar to those manually written ones in a fraction of the time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06720v1
"Response of the Fe K_alpha line emission to the X-ray continuum
  variability in the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC 1566",2022-01-26T16:44:39Z,"W. C. Liang, X. W. Shu, J. X. Wang, Y. Tan, W. J. Zhang, L. M. Sun, N. Jiang, L. M. Dou","NGC 1566 is a changing look AGN known to exhibit recurrent X-ray outbursts
with each lasting for several years. The most recent X-ray outburst is observed
on 2018, with a substantial increase of 2--10 keV flux by a factor of ~24 than
the historical minimum. We re-analyze the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations
covering the pre-outburst, outburst and post-outburst epochs, and confirm the
discovery of the broad feature in the ~5--7 keV band during the period of
outburst that could be interpreted as a relativistic Fe K_alpha emission line.
Our analysis suggests that its flux has increased in tandem with the 2--10 keV
continuum, making it the second changing look AGN in which the broad Fe K_alpha
line responds to the X-ray continuum variability. This behavior strongly
supports the idea that X-rays originates in a corona above the accretion disk,
and disk reflection produces the relativistic Fe K_alpha line. In addition, we
find the response of narrow Fe K_alpha emission line to the changes in the
X-ray continuum on a time-scale as short as four months, allowing to put the
location of line-emitting region at <0.1 pc, comparable to the size of optical
BLR. By comparing to the changing look AGN NGC 2992, the Fe K_alpha variation
rate (the ratio of Fe K_alpha variation to luminosity variation) in NGC 1566
appears greater, which could be possibly explained by larger amount of gas or
Fe abundance responsible for producing the Fe K_alpha line for the latter. The
strength of variable broad Fe K_alpha line as well as the soft X-ray excess
emission appears to be correlated with the accretion rate, which could be
explained as due to the state transition associated with the changing-look
phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11050v1

is interesting and intriguing. The aim of this study is to propose an
approximate analytical expression that allows to simulate changes in surface
charge density changes at cancer-surrounding healthy tissue interface during
the untreated solid tumor growth. For this, the Gompertz and Poisson equations
are used. Simulations reveal that the unperturbed solid tumor growth is closely
related to changes in the surface charge density over time between the tumor
and the surrounding healthy tissue. Furthermore, the unperturbed solid tumor
growth is governed by temporal changes in this surface charge density. It is
concluded that graphic strategies corroborate the correspondence between the
electrical and physiological parameters in the untreated cancer, which may have
an essential role in its growth, progression, metastasis and protection against
immune system attack and anti-cancer therapies. In addition, the knowledge of
surface charge density changes at cancer-surrounding healthy tissue interface

immunotherapy taking into account their polarities. This can also be true in

"The Mathematics of Evolution: The Price Equation, Natural Selection, and
  Environmental Change",2022-02-21T15:10:39Z,Tom LaGatta,"George Price introduced his famous equation to study selective and
environmental effects in discrete populations. We extend Price's framework to
the measurable and quantum cases, decomposing all evolutionary processes into
selective and environmental components. We also extend Fisher's fundamental
theorem, showing that selective change of relative fitness equals variance of
relative fitness.
  We introduce novel selective and environmental entropy functionals. Selective
entropy is non-positive, representing biological negentropy, and environmental
entropy is non-negative, representing physical entropy. Environmental entropy
further decomposes into dispersion and mixing entropies.
  We prove four novel Laws of Natural Selection, showing that selection
consistently acts to increase selection, but can be disrupted by environmental
change. We apply convex analysis to variance and entropy functionals and their
selective changes, and equilibrium processes arise to optimize these
inequalities. These laws are inspired by but distinct from the classical
Thermodynamic Laws.
  Our Zeroth Law is a refinement of Fisher's theorem, showing that variance of
relative fitness is bounded below by a quantity depending on the child-bearing
population. Our First Law shows that selective acceleration of relative fitness
is also bounded below, depending on the variance. This is a non-conservative,
selective version of the Thermodynamic First Law. Our Second Law shows that the
selective change of selective entropy and its selective acceleration are
similarly bounded by non-positive constants. This is a formal, rigorous version
of the Thermodynamic Second Law. Our Third Law shows that for a class of
equilibrium processes, selective change of environmental entropy vanishes, and
otherwise may vary in an open window around zero. This is a selective version
of the Third Law of Thermodynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10289v4
"Identifying and Characterizing Silently-Evolved Methods in the Android
  API",2022-05-31T05:30:37Z,"Pei Liu, Li Li, Yichun Yan, Mattia Fazzini, John Grundy","With over 500,000 commits and more than 700 contributors, the Android
platform is undoubtedly one of the largest industrial-scale software projects.
This project provides the Android API, and developers heavily rely on this API
to develop their Android apps. Unfortunately, because the Android platform and
its API evolve at an extremely rapid pace, app developers need to continually
monitor API changes to avoid compatibility issues in their apps (\ie issues
that prevent apps from working as expected when running on newer versions of
the API). Despite a large number of studies on compatibility issues in the
Android API, the research community has not yet investigated issues related to
silently-evolved methods (SEMs). These methods are functions whose behavior
might have changed but the corresponding documentation did not change
accordingly. Because app developers rely on the provided documentation to
evolve their apps, changes to methods that are not suitably documented may lead
to unexpected failures in the apps using these methods.
  To shed light on this type of issue, we conducted a large-scale empirical
study in which we identified and characterized SEMs across ten versions of the
Android API. In the study, we identified SEMs, characterized the nature of the
changes, and analyzed the impact of SEMs on a set of 1,000 real-world Android
apps. Our experimental results show that SEMs do exist in the Android API, and
that 957 of the apps we considered use at least one SEM. Based on these
results, we argue that the Android platform developers should take actions to
avoid introducing SEMs, especially those involving semantic changes. This
situation highlights the need for automated techniques and tools to help
Android practitioners in this task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15546v1
Attribution-based Explanations that Provide Recourse Cannot be Robust,2022-05-31T14:37:39Z,"Hidde Fokkema, Rianne de Heide, Tim van Erven","Different users of machine learning methods require different explanations,
depending on their goals. To make machine learning accountable to society, one
important goal is to get actionable options for recourse, which allow an
affected user to change the decision $f(x)$ of a machine learning system by
making limited changes to its input $x$. We formalize this by providing a
general definition of recourse sensitivity, which needs to be instantiated with
a utility function that describes which changes to the decisions are relevant
to the user. This definition applies to local attribution methods, which
attribute an importance weight to each input feature. It is often argued that
such local attributions should be robust, in the sense that a small change in
the input $x$ that is being explained, should not cause a large change in the
feature weights. However, we prove formally that it is in general impossible
for any single attribution method to be both recourse sensitive and robust at
the same time. It follows that there must always exist counterexamples to at
least one of these properties. We provide such counterexamples for several
popular attribution methods, including LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients and
SmoothGrad. Our results also cover counterfactual explanations, which may be
viewed as attributions that describe a perturbation of $x$. We further discuss
possible ways to work around our impossibility result, for instance by allowing
the output to consist of sets with multiple attributions, and we provide
sufficient conditions for specific classes of continuous functions to be
recourse sensitive. Finally, we strengthen our impossibility result for the
restricted case where users are only able to change a single attribute of $x$,
by providing an exact characterization of the functions $f$ to which
impossibility applies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15834v3
Inferring 3D change detection from bitemporal optical images,2022-05-31T15:53:33Z,"Valerio Marsocci, Virginia Coletta, Roberta Ravanelli, Simone Scardapane, Mattia Crespi","Change detection is one of the most active research areas in Remote Sensing
(RS). Most of the recently developed change detection methods are based on deep
learning (DL) algorithms. This kind of algorithms is generally focused on
generating two-dimensional (2D) change maps, thus only identifying planimetric
changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and not considering nor returning any
information on the corresponding elevation changes. Our work goes one step
further, proposing two novel networks, able to solve simultaneously the 2D and
3D CD tasks, and the 3DCD dataset, a novel and freely available dataset
precisely designed for this multitask. Particularly, the aim of this work is to
lay the foundations for the development of DL algorithms able to automatically
infer an elevation (3D) CD map -- together with a standard 2D CD map --,
starting only from a pair of bitemporal optical images. The proposed
architectures, to perform the task described before, consist of a
transformer-based network, the MultiTask Bitemporal Images Transformer (MTBIT),
and a deep convolutional network, the Siamese ResUNet (SUNet). Particularly,
MTBIT is a transformer-based architecture, based on a semantic tokenizer. SUNet
instead combines, in a siamese encoder, skip connections and residual layers to
learn rich features, capable to solve efficiently the proposed task. These
models are, thus, able to obtain 3D CD maps from two optical images taken at
different time instants, without the need to rely directly on elevation data
during the inference step. Encouraging results, obtained on the novel 3DCD
dataset, are shown. The code and the 3DCD dataset are available at

The relation between quasars' optical spectra and variability,2022-08-04T04:37:47Z,"Shumpei Nagoshi, Fumihide Iwamuro","This work aimed to find the relationship between quasars' optical variability
and spectral features to reveal the regularity behind the random variation. It
is known that quasar's FeII/Hbeta flux ratio and equivalent width of [OIII]5007
are negatively correlated, called Eigenvector 1. In this work, we visualized
the relationship between the position on this Eigenvector 1 (EV1) plane and how
they had changed their brightness after ~10 years. We conducted three analyses
using different quasar samples each. The first analysis showed the relation
between their distributions on the EV1 plane and how much they had changed
brightness, using 13,438 Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. This result shows
how brightness changes later are clearly related to the position on the EV1
plane. In the second analysis, we plotted the sources reported as
Changing-Look(State) Quasars on the EV1 plane. This result shows that the
position on the EV1 plane corresponds activity level of each source, the bright
or dim state of them are distributed on the opposite sides divided by the
typical quasar distribution. In the third analysis, we examined the transition
vectors on the EV1 plane using sources with multiple-epoch spectra. This result
shows that the brightening and dimming sources move on the similar path and
they turn into the position corresponding to the opposite activity level. We
also found this trend is opposite to the empirical rule that RFeII positively
correlated with the Eddington ratio, which has been proposed based on the
trends of a large number of quasars. From all these analyses, it is indicated
that quasars tend to oscillate between both sides of the distribution ridge on
the EV1 plane; each of them corresponds to a dim state and a bright state. This
trend in optical variation suggests that significant brightness changes, such
as Changing-Look quasars, are expected to repeat.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02449v1
A structurally informed model for modulating functional connectivity,2022-08-24T16:06:01Z,"Andrew C. Murphy, Romain Duprat, Theodore D. Satterthwaite, Desmond J. Oathes, Dani S. Bassett","Functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions tracks symptom severity in
many neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
directly alters regional activity and indirectly alters FC. Predicting how FC
will change following TMS is difficult, but would allow novel therapies that
target FC to improve symptoms. We address this challenge by proposing a
predictive model that explains how TMS-induced activation can change the
strength of FC. Here, we focus on the FC of the frontoparietal (FPS) and
default mode (DMS) systems given the importance of their FC in executive
function and affective disorders. We fit this model to neuroimaging data in 29
individuals who received TMS to the frontal cortex and evaluated the FC between
the FPS and DMS. For each individual, we measured the TMS-induced change in FC
between the FPS and DMS (the FC network), and the structural coupling between
the stimulated area and the FPS and DMS (the structural context network (SCN)).
We find that TMS-induced FC changes are best predicted when the model accounts
for white matter fibers from the stimulated area to the two systems. We find
that the correlation between these two networks (structure-function coupling) -
and therefore the predictability of the TMS-induced modulation - was highest
when the SCN contained a dense core of intraconnected regions, indicating that
the stimulated area had ample access to an anatomical module. Further, we found
that when the core of the SCN overlapped with the FPS and DMS, we observed the
greatest change in the strength of their FC. Broadly, our findings explain how
the structural connectivity of a stimulated region modulates TMS-induced
changes in the brain's functional network. Efforts to account for such
structural connections could improve predictions of TMS response, further
informing the development of TMS protocols for clinical translation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11631v1
Fast Re-Optimization of LeadingOnes with Frequent Changes,2022-09-09T16:51:41Z,"Nina Bulanova, Arina Buzdalova, Carola Doerr","In real-world optimization scenarios, the problem instance that we are asked
to solve may change during the optimization process, e.g., when new information
becomes available or when the environmental conditions change. In such
situations, one could hope to achieve reasonable performance by continuing the
search from the best solution found for the original problem. Likewise, one may
hope that when solving several problem instances that are similar to each
other, it can be beneficial to ``warm-start'' the optimization process of the
second instance by the best solution found for the first. However, it was shown
in [Doerr et al., GECCO 2019] that even when initialized with structurally good
solutions, evolutionary algorithms can have a tendency to replace these good
solutions by structurally worse ones, resulting in optimization times that have
no advantage over the same algorithms started from scratch. Doerr et al. also
proposed a diversity mechanism to overcome this problem. Their approach
balances greedy search around a best-so-far solution for the current problem
with search in the neighborhood around the best-found solution for the previous
instance.
  In this work, we first show that the re-optimization approach suggested by
Doerr et al. reaches a limit when the problem instances are prone to more
frequent changes. More precisely, we show that they get stuck on the dynamic
LeadingOnes problem in which the target string changes periodically. We then
propose a modification of their algorithm which interpolates between greedy
search around the previous-best and the current-best solution. We empirically
evaluate our smoothed re-optimization algorithm on LeadingOnes instances with
various frequencies of change and with different perturbation factors and show
that it outperforms both a fully restarted (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm and the
re-optimization approach by Doerr et al.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04391v1

functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that bonding distortion and
structurally well-confined layers contribute to improve phase change properties

generated heat inside active region, which leads to reduction of switching
energy. Since Ge-Te bonds adjacent to short and strong Ti-Te bonds are more
elongated than the bonds near Sb-Te, it is easier for Ge atoms to break the
bond with Te due to strengthened Peierls distortions (Rlong/Rshort) during
phase change process. Properties of advanced iPCM (cycling endurance, write

Megan Urry","Changing-look (CL) AGN are unique probes of accretion onto supermassive black
holes (SMBHs), especially when simultaneous observations in complementary
wavebands allow investigations into the properties of their accretion flows. We
present the results of a search for CL behaviour in 412 Swift-BAT detected AGN
with multiple epochs of optical spectroscopy from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic
Survey (BASS). 125 of these AGN also have 14-195 keV ultra-hard X-ray
light-curves from Swift-BAT which are contemporaneous with the epochs of
optical spectroscopy. Eight CL events are presented for the first time, where
the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer line emission leads to a change
in the observed Seyfert type classification. Combining with known events from
the literature, 21 AGN from BASS are now known to display CL behaviour. Nine CL
events have 14-195 keV data available, and five of these CL events can be
associated with significant changes in their 14-195 keV flux from BAT. The
ultra-hard X-ray flux is less affected by obscuration and so these changes in
the 14-195 keV band suggest that the majority of our CL events are not due to
changes in line-of-sight obscuration. We derive a CL rate of 0.7-6.2 per cent
on 10-25 year time-scales, and show that many transitions happen within at most
a few years. Our results motivate further multi-wavelength observations with

Probst, Maria Santos-Lleo","IRAS23226-3843 has previously been classified as a changing-look AGN based on
X-ray and optical spectral variations. In 2019, Swift observations revealed a
strong rebrightening in X-ray and UV fluxes in comparison to observations in
2017. We took follow-up Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations together
with optical spectra (SALT and SAAO 1.9m telescope) from 2019 until 2021.
IRAS23226-3843 showed a strong X-ray and optical outburst in 2019. It varied in
the X-ray and optical continuum by a factor of 5 and 1.6, respectively, within
two months. This corresponds to a factor of 3 in the optical after correction
for the host galaxy contribution. The Balmer and FeII emission-line intensities
showed comparable variability amplitudes. The Halpha profiles changed from a
blue-peaked profile in the years 1997 and 1999 to a broad double-peaked profile
in 2017 and 2019. However, there were no major profile variations in the
extremely broad double-peaked profiles despite the strong intensity variations
in 2019. One year after the outburst, the optical spectral type changed and
became a Seyfert type 2 in 2020. Blue outflow components are present in the
Balmer lines and in the Fe band in the X-rays. A deep broadband
XMM-Newton/NuSTAR spectrum was taken during the maximum state in 2019. This
spectrum is qualitatively very similar to a spectrum taken in 2017, but by a
factor of 10 higher. The soft X-ray band appears featureless. The soft excess
is well modeled with a Comptonization model. A broadband fit with a power-law
continuum, Comptonized soft excess, and Galactic absorption gives a good fit to
the combined EPIC-pn and NuSTAR spectrum. In addition, we see a complex and
broadened Fe K emission-line profile in the X-rays. The changing-look character
in IRAS23226-3843 is most probably caused by changes in the accretion rate --

  Regression",2022-01-25T06:50:01Z,"Kyohei Shimozato, Michihiro Shintani, Takashi Sato","Outlier detection of semiconductor devices is important since manufacturing
variation is inherently inevitable. In order to properly detect outliers, it is
necessary to consider the discrepancy from underlying trend. Conventional
methods are insufficient as they cannot track spatial changes of the trend}}.
This study proposes an adaptive outlier detection using Gaussian process
regression (GPR) with Student-t likelihood, which captures a gradual spatial
change of characteristic variation. According to the credible interval of the
GPR posterior distribution, the devices having excessively large deviations
against the underlying trend are detected. The proposed methodology is

classical non-relativistic spinning particles. The microscopic structure
elements of the system are massive point particles with a nonzero proper

The direction of proper angular momentum changes continuously. Applying the
Gibbs canonical formalism for the rotating system, we construct the
one-particle distribution function, generalising the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann

Risk Sharing and the Adoption of the Euro,2022-05-14T08:48:43Z,"Alessandro Ferrari, Anna Rogantini Picco","This paper empirically evaluates whether adopting a common currency has

  in Dynamic Environments",2022-01-03T08:44:33Z,"Wenjian Luo, Xin Lin, Changhe Li, Shengxiang Yang, Yuhui Shi","Dynamic and multimodal features are two important properties and widely
existed in many real-world optimization problems. The former illustrates that
the objectives and/or constraints of the problems change over time, while the
latter means there is more than one optimal solution (sometimes including the
accepted local solutions) in each environment. The dynamic multimodal
optimization problems (DMMOPs) have both of these characteristics, which have
been studied in the field of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence
for years, and attract more and more attention. Solving such problems requires
optimization algorithms to simultaneously track multiple optima in the changing
environments. So that the decision makers can pick out one optimal solution in
each environment according to their experiences and preferences, or quickly
turn to other solutions when the current one cannot work well. This is very
helpful for the decision makers, especially when facing changing environments.
In this competition, a test suit about DMMOPs is given, which models the
real-world applications. Specifically, this test suit adopts 8 multimodal
functions and 8 change modes to construct 24 typical dynamic multimodal
optimization problems. Meanwhile, the metric is also given to measure the
algorithm performance, which considers the average number of optimal solutions
found in all environments. This competition will be very helpful to promote the
development of dynamic multimodal optimization algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00523v2
Convectively driven decadal zonal accelerations in Earth's fluid core,2022-01-03T19:19:47Z,"Colin More, Mathieu Dumberry","Azimuthal accelerations of cylindrical surfaces co-axial with the rotation
axis have been inferred to exist in Earth's fluid core on the basis of magnetic
field observations and changes in the length-of-day. These accelerations have a
typical timescale of decades. However, the physical mechanism causing the
accelerations is not well understood. Scaling arguments suggest that the
leading order torque averaged over cylindrical surfaces should arise from the
Lorentz force. Decadal fluctuations in the magnetic field inside the core,
driven by convective flows, could then force decadal changes in the Lorentz
torque and generate zonal accelerations. We test this hypothesis by
constructing a quasi-geostrophic model of magnetoconvection, with
thermally-driven flows perturbing a steady, imposed background magnetic field.
We show that when the Alfv\'{e}n number in our model is similar to that in
Earth's fluid core, temporal fluctuations in the torque balance are dominated
by the Lorentz torque, with the latter generating mean zonal accelerations. Our
model reproduces both fast, free Alfv\'{e}n waves and slow, forced
accelerations, with ratios of relative strength and relative timescale similar
to those inferred for the Earth's core. The temporal changes in the magnetic
field which drive the time-varying Lorentz torque are produced by the
underlying convective flows, shearing and advecting the magnetic field on a
timescale associated with convective eddies. Our results support the hypothesis
that temporal changes in the magnetic field deep inside Earth's fluid core
drive the observed decadal zonal accelerations of cylindrical surfaces through
the Lorentz torque.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00846v1

ferroelectric phase transition associated with a very large entropy change and
both electrocaloric and barocaloric functionality. While the structural origins
of the electrical polarisation are now well established, those of the entropy
change have been controversial for over fifty years. This question is resolved
here using a combination of DFT phonon calculations with inelastic neutron
scattering under variable temperature and pressure, supported by complementary
total and quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. A simple model of the
entropy in which each molecular ion is disordered across the mirror plane in
the high symmetry phase, although widely used in the literature, proves to be
untenable. Instead, the entropy arises from low-frequency librations of
ammonium ions in this phase, with harmonic terms that are very small or even
negative. These results suggest that, in the search for molecular materials
with functionality derived from large entropy changes, vibrational entropy
arising from broad energy minima is likely to be just as important as
configurational entropy arising from crystallographic disorder.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02548v2
Landau-type sudden transitions of quantum correlations,2022-01-18T14:12:47Z,Mikhail A. Yurischev,"Sudden changes of quantum correlations in the Bell-diagonal states are
well-known effects. They occur when the set of optimal parameters that
determine the quantum correlation consists of isolated points and optimal
parameters during the evolution of the system jump from one such point to
another (e.g., the optimal measurement angle of the quantum discord changes
discontinuously from zero to $\pi/2$ or vice versa). However, when considering
more general X quantum states, we found that quantum discord and one-way
quantum work deficit can experience sudden changes of other kinds. Namely, the
optimal measurement angle may suddenly start to shift {\em continuously} from
its stationary value 0 or $\pi/2$ to an intermediate optimal measurement angle
$\vartheta\in(0,\pi/2)$. This leads to a new behavior of quantum correlations,
which is mathematically described by the Landau phenomenological theory of
second-order phase transitions. In addition, for the one-way quantum work
deficit, we found cases where the optimal measurement angle jumps from zero to
a nonzero step less than $\pi/2$, and then continuously changes its value. This
behavior of quantum correlation is similar to a first-order phase transition in
Landau's theory. Dependencies of quantum discord and one-way quantum work
deficit near the boundaries, which separate regions with state-dependent
(variable) and state-independent (stationary, constant) optimal measurement
angles, are examined in detail on an example of the XXZ spin model in an
external field at thermal equilibrium.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07005v1

Fully Online Meta-Learning Without Task Boundaries,2022-02-01T07:51:24Z,"Jathushan Rajasegaran, Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine","While deep networks can learn complex functions such as classifiers,
detectors, and trackers, many applications require models that continually
adapt to changing input distributions, changing tasks, and changing
environmental conditions. Indeed, this ability to continuously accrue knowledge
and use past experience to learn new tasks quickly in continual settings is one
of the key properties of an intelligent system. For complex and
high-dimensional problems, simply updating the model continually with standard
learning algorithms such as gradient descent may result in slow adaptation.
Meta-learning can provide a powerful tool to accelerate adaptation yet is
conventionally studied in batch settings. In this paper, we study how
meta-learning can be applied to tackle online problems of this nature,
simultaneously adapting to changing tasks and input distributions and
meta-training the model in order to adapt more quickly in the future. Extending
meta-learning into the online setting presents its own challenges, and although
several prior methods have studied related problems, they generally require a
discrete notion of tasks, with known ground-truth task boundaries. Such methods
typically adapt to each task in sequence, resetting the model between tasks,
rather than adapting continuously across tasks. In many real-world settings,
such discrete boundaries are unavailable, and may not even exist. To address
these settings, we propose a Fully Online Meta-Learning (FOML) algorithm, which
does not require any ground truth knowledge about the task boundaries and stays
fully online without resetting back to pre-trained weights. Our experiments
show that FOML was able to learn new tasks faster than the state-of-the-art

  Long-term Cough Monitoring",2022-02-08T15:38:34Z,"Madhurananda Pahar, Igor Miranda, Andreas Diacon, Thomas Niesler","We present a new machine learning based bed-occupancy detection system that
uses the accelerometer signal captured by a bed-attached consumer smartphone.
Automatic bed-occupancy detection is necessary for automatic long-term cough
monitoring, since the time which the monitored patient occupies the bed is
required to accurately calculate a cough rate. Accelerometer measurements are
more cost effective and less intrusive than alternatives such as video
monitoring or pressure sensors. A 249-hour dataset of manually-labelled
acceleration signals gathered from seven patients undergoing treatment for
tuberculosis (TB) was compiled for experimentation. These signals are
characterised by brief activity bursts interspersed with long periods of little
or no activity, even when the bed is occupied. To process them effectively, we
propose an architecture consisting of three interconnected components. An
occupancy-change detector locates instances at which bed occupancy is likely to
have changed, an occupancy-interval detector classifies periods between
detected occupancy changes and an occupancy-state detector corrects
falsely-identified occupancy changes. Using long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, this architecture was demonstrated to achieve an AUC of 0.94. When
integrated into a complete cough monitoring system, the daily cough rate of a
patient undergoing TB treatment was determined over a period of 14 days. As the
colony forming unit (CFU) counts decreased and the time to positivity (TPP)
increased, the measured cough rate decreased, indicating effective TB
treatment. This provides a first indication that automatic cough monitoring
based on bed-mounted accelerometer measurements may present a non-invasive,
non-intrusive and cost-effective means of monitoring long-term recovery of TB
patients.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03936v2

Minimum rank and failed zero forcing number of graphs,2022-02-10T12:45:10Z,"Ma. Nerissa M. Abara, Prince Allan B. Pelayo","Let $G$ be a simple, finite, and undirected graph with vertices each given an
initial coloring of either blue or white. Zero forcing on graph $G$ is an
iterative process of forcing its white vertices to become blue after a finite
application of a specified color-change rule. We say that an initial set $S$ of
blue vertices of $G$ is a zero forcing set for $G$ under the specified
color-change rule if a finite number of iterations of zero forcing results to
an updated coloring where all vertices of $G$ are blue. Otherwise, we say that
$S$ is a failed zero forcing set for $G$ under the specified color-change rule.
It is not difficult to see that any subset of a failed zero forcing set is also
failed. Hence, our interest lies on the maximum possible cardinality of a
failed zero forcing set, which we refer to as the failed zero forcing number of
$G$. In this paper, we consider two color-change rules $-$ standard and
positive semidefinite. We compute for the failed zero forcing numbers of
several graph families. Furthermore, under each graph family, we characterize
the graphs $G$ for which the failed zero forcing number is equal to the minimum

  clusters",2022-02-10T19:00:01Z,"Stephanie O'Neil, Josh Borrow, Mark Vogelsberger, Benedikt Diemer","We explore how the splashback radius ($R_{\rm sp}$) of galaxy clusters,
measured using the number density of the subhalo population, changes based on
various selection criteria using the IllustrisTNG cosmological galaxy formation
simulation. We identify $R_{\rm sp}$ by extracting the steepest radial gradient
in a stacked set of clusters in 0.5 dex wide mass bins, with our clusters
having halo masses $10^{13} \leq M_{\rm 200, mean} / {\rm M}_\odot \leq
10^{15}$. We apply cuts in subhalo mass, galaxy stellar mass, $i$-band absolute
magnitude and specific star formation rate. We find that, generally, galaxies
of increasing mass and luminosity trace smaller measured splashback radii
relative to the intrinsic dark matter radius. We also show that quenched
galaxies may be used to reliably reconstruct the dark matter splashback radius.
This trend is likely due to changes in the galaxy population. Additionally, we
are able to reconcile different observational predictions that $R_{\rm sp}$
based upon galaxy number counts and dark matter may either align or show
significant offset (e.g. those using optically- or SZ-selected clusters)
through the selection functions that these studies employ. Finally, we
demonstrate that changes in $R_{\rm sp}$ measured through number counts are not
due to a simple change in galaxy abundance inside and outside of the cluster.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05277v2

  of silica glass and the Prigogine-Defay ratio",2022-02-18T09:09:33Z,"Koun Shirai, Kota Watanabe, Hiroyoshi Momida","The most important characteristic of glass transition is a jump in specific
heat $\Delta C_{p}$. Despite its significance, no standard theory exists to
describe it. In this study, first-principles molecular-dynamics (MD)
simulations are used to describe the glass transition of silica glass, which
presents many challenges. The novel view that state variables are extended to
include the equilibrium positions of atoms $\{ \bar{\bf R}_{j} \}$ is fully
used in analyzing the simulation results. Decomposing the internal energy into
three components (structural, phonon, and thermal expansion energies) reveals
that the jump $\Delta C_{p}$ of silica glass is entirely determined by the
component of structural energy. The reason for the small $\Delta C_{p}$ is its
high glass-transition temperature, which makes the fluctuation in the
structural energy insensitive to temperature changes. This significantly
affects how the Prigogine-Defay ratio $\it{\Pi}$ is interpreted, which was
previously unknown. The ratio $\it{\Pi}$ represents the ratio of the total
energy change to the contribution of thermal expansion energy at the glass
transition. The general property, $\it{\Pi}>1$, of glasses indicates that glass
transitions occur mainly by changes in the structural energy. Silica glass is
an extreme case in that the transition occurs entirely by the change in
internal structure, such as the distribution of the bending angle of Si--O--Si
bond.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09088v1

  Molecular Crystal",2022-02-19T13:27:01Z,"Peter I. C. Cooke, Ioan B. Magdău, Graeme J. Ackland","We calculate the eigenstates of a diatomic molecule in a range of model
mean-field potentials, and evaluate the evolution of their associated Raman
spectra with field strength. We demonstrate that dramatic changes in the
appearance of the Raman spectrum for a diatomic molecule occur without any
associated change in the symmetry of the surrounding potential. The limiting
cases of the quantum eigenstates correspond, in the classical sense, to free
rotation, and libration of well-oriented molecules. However, there are also
many mixed modes which are neither rotons nor librons. The consequence for
Raman spectroscopy is a series of complications - the non-harmonic potential
splits the Raman active modes, and breaks the selection rules on forbidden
modes. The mass-dependence of the various states is different - rotors,
oscillators and reorientations have $1/m$, $1/\sqrt{m}$ and weaker mass
dependence respectively. This may allow one to identify the character of the
mode with isotope spectroscopy. However it is complicated by mixed modes and
transitions between two different eigenstates with different character. We
conclude that significant changes in the Raman spectrum of molecular systems
are insufficient to demonstrate a phase transition since such changes can also
occur in a fixed symmetry potential upon increasing field strength.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09604v1

"Inertial focusing of spherical particles in curved microfluidic ducts at
  moderate Dean numbers",2022-02-22T22:10:06Z,"Brendan Harding, Yvonne M. Stokes","We examine the effect of Dean number on the inertial focusing of spherical
particles suspended in flow through curved microfluidic ducts. Previous
modelling of particle migration in curved ducts assumed the flow rate was small
enough that a leading order approximation of the background flow with respect
to the Dean number produces a reasonable model. Herein, we extend our model to
situations having a moderate Dean number (in the microfluidics context) while
the particle Reynolds number remains small. This extension allows us to capture
changes in the background flow that occur with increasing flow rate, namely a
shift in local extrema towards the outside wall. The change in the axial
velocity profile of the background flow has an effect on the inertial lift
force, while the change in the cross-sectional components directly affects the
secondary flow drag. In keeping the particle Reynolds number small we
approximate the inertial lift force in a similar manner to previous studies
while capturing subtle effects do to the modified background flow profile.
Capturing and understanding these effects is an important step towards
accurately modelling inertial migration across a wide range of practical
applications. Our results reveal how the changing background flow profile
modifies the inertial focusing of particles. We illustrate enhanced lateral
separation of particles by size in a number of scenarios and find that focusing
times can be roughly separated into two regimes. These results suggest our
model might aid with parameter choices for separation of particles by size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11209v1
Transitions in Dynamic Point Labeling,2022-02-23T15:18:19Z,"Thomas Depian, Guangping Li, Martin Nöllenburg, Jules Wulms","The labeling of point features on a map is a well-studied topic. In a static
setting, the goal is to find a non-overlapping label placement for (a subset
of) point features. In a dynamic setting, the set of point features and their
corresponding labels change, and the labeling has to adapt to such changes. To
aid the user in tracking these changes, we can use morphs, here called
transitions, to indicate how a labeling changes. Such transitions have not
gained much attention yet, and we investigate different types of transitions
for labelings of points, most notably consecutive transitions and simultaneous
transitions. We give (tight) bounds on the number of overlaps that can occur
during these transitions. When each label has a (non-negative) weight
associated to it, and each overlap imposes a penalty proportional to the weight
of the overlapping labels, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether the
penalty during a simultaneous transition has weight at most $k$. Finally, in a
case study, we consider geotagged Twitter data on a map, by labeling points
with rectangular labels showing tweets. We developed a prototype implementation
to evaluate different transition styles in practice, measuring both number of
overlaps and transition duration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11562v2

since they can track visual objects at high speeds. Additionally, adaptive
tracking methods, where target samples collected by the tracker are employed
for online learning, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, single
object tracking (SOT) remains a challenging task in real-world application due
to changes and deformations in a target object's appearance. Learning on all
the collected samples may lead to catastrophic forgetting, and thereby corrupt
the tracking model.
  In this paper, SOT is formulated as an online incremental learning problem. A
new method is proposed for dynamic sample selection and memory replay,
preventing template corruption. In particular, we propose a change detection
mechanism to detect gradual changes in object appearance and select the
corresponding samples for online adaption. In addition, an entropy-based sample
selection strategy is introduced to maintain a diversified auxiliary buffer for
memory replay. Our proposed method can be integrated into any object tracking
algorithm that leverages online learning for model adaptation.
  Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123, and

the contribution of its key components. Results indicate that integrating our

vastly used as electronic devices in various applications, such as memory
devices, energy harvesters, sensors, and actuators. Recently, we reported the
realization of the smallest bi-stable resonator to date, in the form of a
buckled suspended carbon nanotube (CNT), which exhibits a unique
three-dimensional snap-through transition and an extremely large change in
frequency as a result. In this article, we address a unique characteristic of
these devices, in which a significant change in the DC conductance is also
observed at the mechanical snap-through transition. After verifying that the
change in the CNT tension due to the ""jump"" cannot account for the conductance
difference measured, we attribute the conductance ""jump"" to the change in
capacitance as a result of the snap-through buckling. However, we show that
quantitative analysis of this phenomenon is not at all trivial, and is enabled
only due to our ability to predict the exact CNT shape before and after the
transition. Understanding this mechanism enables a fast characterization of
fabricated devices and improves our understanding of their behavior, key in
developing this technology further and better design. As an example, we show

Building on the recently introduced Bayesian Context Trees (BCT) framework, the
distributions of different segments in a discrete time series are described as

observation that facilitates effective sampling is that, using one of the BCT
algorithms, the prior predictive likelihood of the data can be computed
exactly, integrating out all the models and parameters in each segment. This
makes it possible to sample directly from the posterior distribution of the
number and location of the change-points, leading to accurate estimates and
providing a natural quantitative measure of uncertainty in the results.

it increases code velocity despite lacking evidence validating the practice.
Surprisingly, this fundamental question has not been studied to date. This
study investigates the practicality of improving code velocity by optimizing
pull request size and composition (ratio of insertions, deletions, and

to time-to-merge. Regardless of the contextual factors that can influence pull
request size or composition (e.g., programming language), the observation
holds. Pull request data from two other platforms: Gerrit and Phabricator

  equilibrium and shear-induced phase separation",2022-03-12T09:56:10Z,"Marco De Corato, Marino Arroyo","Chemically-responsive polymers are macromolecules that respond to local
variations of the chemical composition of the solution by changing their
conformation, with notable examples including polyelectrolytes, proteins and
DNA. The polymer conformation changes can occur in response to changes to the
pH, the ionic strength or to the concentration of a generic solute that
interacts with the polymer. These chemical stimuli can lead to drastic
variations of the polymer flexibility and even trigger a transition from a coil
to a globule polymer conformation. In many situations the spatial distribution
of the chemical stimuli can be highly inhomogeneous, which can lead to large
spatial variations of polymer conformation and of the rheological properties of
the mixture. In this paper, we develop a theory for the flow of a mixture of a
solute and chemically-responsive polymers. The approach is valid for generic
flows and inhomogeneous distributions of polymers and solutes. To model the
polymer conformation changes introduced by the interactions with the solute, we
consider the polymers as linear elastic dumbbells whose spring stiffness
depends on the solute concentration. We use the Onsager's variational formalism
to derive the equations governing the evolution of the variables, which unveils
novel couplings between the distribution of dumbbells and that of the solute.
Finally, we use a linear stability analysis to show that the governing
equations predict an equilibrium phase separation and a distinct shear-induced
phase separation whereby a homogeneous distribution of solute and dumbbells
spontaneously demix. Similar phase transitions have been observed in previous
experiments using stimuli-responsive polymers and may play an important role in
living systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06392v2

radar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing
attentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based
methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but
they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use
clustering to obtain pseudo-labels for training, and the pseudo-labeled samples
often involve errors, which can be considered as ""label noise"". To address
these issues, we propose a Dual Path Denoising Network (DPDNet) for SAR image
change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to
clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the
distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the
time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select
distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are
selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a
great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its
computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been

than those in existing publications. We characterize the average scale heights
of the HI distributions for a subset of most inclined galaxies (inclination >
80 deg), and compare them to the radio continuum intensity scale heights, which
have been derived in a similar way. The two types of scale heights are well
correlated, with similar dependence on disk radial extension and star formation
rate surface density but different dependence on mass surface density. This
result indicates that the vertical distribution of the two components may be
governed by similar fundamental physics but with subtle differences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07818v1
V889 Her: abrupt changes in the magnetic field or differential rotation?,2022-03-25T00:28:34Z,"Teemu Willamo, Thomas Hackman, Jyri J. Lehtinen, Maarit Korpi-Lagg, Oleg Kochukhov","We have applied Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) to an extensive
spectropolarimetric HARPSpol data set of the magnetically active young solar
analogue V889 Her, covering 35 spectra obtained during six nights in May 2011.
The data set allows us to study Stokes V profiles of the star at almost
identical rotational phases, separated by one or more stellar rotations. We use
these data to study if the line profiles evolve from one rotation to the next,
and find that some evolution does indeed occur. We consider two possible
explanations for this: abrupt changes in the large-scale magnetic field or
differential rotation. We find it quite difficult to distinguish between the
two alternatives using ZDI alone. A strong differential rotation could,
however, explain the changes in the line profiles, so we conclude that it must
be present, and the abrupt magnetic field evolution is left uncertain.
Commonly, rapidly rotating stars are assumed to have only weak differential
rotation. If the strong differential rotation of V889 Her is indeed present, as
has been found in other studies as well, it could indicate that the theoretical
and numerical results of differential rotation still need to be revised. The
rapid changes that may have occurred in the magnetic field indicate that one
should be quite cautious when interpreting ZDI maps constructed from data over
long time intervals.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13398v2
Analysis and transformations of voice level in singing voice,2022-04-08T11:34:33Z,"Frederik Bous, Axel Roebel","We introduce a neural auto-encoder that transforms the musical dynamic in
recordings of singing voice via changes in voice level. Since most recordings
of singing voice are not annotated with voice level we propose a means to
estimate the voice level from the signal's timbre using a neural voice level
estimator. We introduce the recording factor that relates the voice level to
the recorded signal power as a proportionality constant. This unknown constant
depends on the recording conditions and the post-processing and may thus be
different for each recording (but is constant across each recording). We
provide two approaches to estimate the voice level without knowing the
recording factor. The unknown recording factor can either be learned alongside
the weights of the voice level estimator, or a special loss function based on
the scalar product can be used to only match the contour of the recorded
signal's power. The voice level models are used to condition a previously
introduced bottleneck auto-encoder that disentangles its input, the
mel-spectrogram, from the voice level. We evaluate the voice level models on
recordings annotated with musical dynamic and by their ability to provide
useful information to the auto-encoder. A perceptive test is carried out that
evaluates the perceived change in voice level in transformed recordings and the
synthesis quality. The perceptive test confirms that changing the conditional
input changes the perceived voice level accordingly thus suggesting that the
proposed voice level models encode information about the true voice level.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04006v2

"A Machine Learning Approach to Determine the Semantic Versioning Type of
  npm Packages Releases",2022-04-12T16:31:27Z,"Rabe Abdalkareem, Md Atique Reza Chowdhury, Emad Shihab","Semantic versioning policy is widely used to indicate the level of changes in
a package release. Unfortunately, there are many cases where developers do not
respect the semantic versioning policy, leading to the breakage of dependent
applications. To reduce such cases, we proposed using machine learning (ML)
techniques to effectively predict the new release type, i.e., patch, minor,
major, in order to properly determine the semantic versioning type. To perform
our prediction, we mined and used a number of features about a release, such as
the complexity of the changed code, change types, and development activities.
We then used four ML classifiers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
ML classifiers, we conducted an empirical study on 31 JavaScript packages
containing a total of approximately 6,260 releases. We started by extracting 41
release level features from historical data of packages' source code and
repositories. Then, we used four machine learning classifiers, namely XGBoost,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. We found that the
XGBoost classifiers performed the best, achieving median ROC AUC values of
0.78, 0.69, and 0.74 for major, minor, and patch releases, respectively. We
also found that features related to the change types in a release are the best
predictors group of features in determining the semantic versioning type.
Finally, we studied the generalizability of determining the semantic versioning
type by applying cross-package validation. Our results showed that the general
classifier achieved median ROC AUC values of 0.76, 0.69, and 0.75 for major,
minor, and patch releases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05929v1

interest"" from co-registered bi-temporal images. The performance of existing
deep supervised CD methods is attributed to the large amounts of annotated data
used to train the networks. However, annotating large amounts of remote sensing
images is labor-intensive and expensive, particularly with bi-temporal images,
as it requires pixel-wise comparisons by a human expert. On the other hand, we
often have access to unlimited unlabeled multi-temporal RS imagery thanks to
ever-increasing earth observation programs. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective way to leverage the information from unlabeled bi-temporal images
to improve the performance of CD approaches. More specifically, we propose a
semi-supervised CD model in which we formulate an unsupervised CD loss in
addition to the supervised Cross-Entropy (CE) loss by constraining the output
change probability map of a given unlabeled bi-temporal image pair to be
consistent under the small random perturbations applied on the deep feature
difference map that is obtained by subtracting their latent feature
representations. Experiments conducted on two publicly available CD datasets

macroscopic rheology of these systems have been studied separately in detail,
the development of direct connections between the two has been difficult,
particularly with regard to the non-linear rheology. To bridge this gap, we
perform a series of large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) numerical
measurements on model soft particulate gels at different volume fractions using
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We first study a particulate
network with local bending stiffness and then we combine it with a second
component that can provide additional crosslinking to obtain two-component
networks. Through the sequence of physical processes (SPP) framework we define
time-resolved dynamic moduli and, by tracking the changes in these moduli
through the period, we can distinguish transitions in the material behavior as
a function of time. This approach helps us establish the microsopic origin of
the non-linear rheology by connecting the changes in dynamic moduli to the
corresponding microstructural changes during the deformation including the
non-affine displacement of particles, and the breakage, formation, and
orientation of bonds.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09118v2

that current deep model-based methods have serious limitations. We dive deeper
into the causes of this poor performance, by identifying elements that hurt
adaptive behavior and linking these to underlying techniques frequently used in
deep model-based RL. We empirically validate these insights in the case of
linear function approximation by demonstrating that a modified version of

recent experimental studies have found that explanations do not always improve
human use of algorithmic advice. In this study, we shed light on how people
interpret and respond to counterfactual explanations (CFEs) -- explanations
that show how a model's output would change with marginal changes to its

ran think-aloud trials with eight sitting U.S. state court judges, providing
them with recommendations from a PRAI that includes CFEs. We found that the
CFEs did not alter the judges' decisions. At first, judges misinterpreted the
counterfactuals as real -- rather than hypothetical -- changes to defendants.
Once judges understood what the counterfactuals meant, they ignored them,
stating their role is only to make decisions regarding the actual defendant in
question. The judges also expressed a mix of reasons for ignoring or following
the advice of the PRAI without CFEs. These results add to the literature

  network",2022-05-15T00:07:12Z,"Thibaud Taillefumier, Phillip Whitman","Idealized networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like
interactions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit.
These equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling,
the mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite
fraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic
synchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is
the key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in
mean-field neural models. However, such a resolution is hindered by the
first-passage nature of the mean-field interaction in classically considered
dynamics. Here, we introduce a delayed Poissonian variation of the classical
integrate-and-fire dynamics for which blowups are analytically well defined in
the mean-field limit. Albeit fundamentally nonlinear, we show that this delayed
Poissonian dynamics can be transformed into a noninteracting linear dynamics
via a deterministic time change. We specify this time change as the solution of
a nonlinear, delayed integral equation via renewal analysis of first-passage
problems. This formulation also reveals that the fraction of simultaneously
spiking neurons can be determined via a self-consistent,
probability-conservation principle about the time-changed linear dynamics. We
utilize the proposed framework in a companion paper to show analytically the
existence of singular mean-field dynamics with sustained synchrony for large

change of pulsars has many implications both for the magnetospheric physics and
the neutron star interior. The middle-aged pulsar PSR J0738$-$4042, which had
been observed to display variations in the pulse profile associated with its
spin-down rate change due to external effects, is a remarkable example. In this
study, based on the 12.5-yr combined public timing data from UTMOST and Parkes,
we have detected a new emission-rotation correlation in PSR J0738$-$4042
concurrent with a glitch. A glitch that occurred at MJD 57359(5) (December 3,
2015) with $\Delta\nu/\nu \sim 0.36(4)\times 10^{-9}$ is the first glitch event
observed in this pulsar and is probably the underlying cause of the
emission-rotation correlation. Unlike the usual post-glitch behaviours, the
braking torque on the pulsar has continued to increase over 1380 d,
corresponding to a significant decrease in $\ddot{\nu}$. As for changes in the
pulse profile after the glitch, the relative amplitude of the leading component
weakens drastically, while the middle component becomes stronger. A combined
model of crustquake induced platelet movement and vortex creep response is
invoked to account for this rare correlation. In this scenario, magnetospheric
state-change is naturally linked to the pulsar-intrinsic processes that give
rise to a glitch.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08296v2

development has led to the creation of large inter-dependency networks, where
sustainability issues of a single library can have widespread network effects.
Maintainers of these libraries are often overworked, relying on the
contributions of volunteers to sustain these libraries. In this work, we
measure contributions that are aligned with dependency changes, to understand
where they come from (i.e., non-maintainer, client maintainer, library
maintainer, and library and client maintainer), analyze whether they contribute
to library dormancy (i.e., a lack of activity), and investigate the
similarities between these contributions and developers' typical contributions.
Hence, we leverage socio-technical techniques to measure the
dependency-contribution congruence (DC congruence), i.e., the degree to which

to measure the DC congruence for the NPM ecosystem using 1.7 million issues,
970 thousand pull requests (PR), and over 5.3 million commits belonging to
107,242 NPM packages. At the ecosystem level, we pinpoint in time peaks of
congruence with dependency changes (i.e., 16% DC congruence score).
Surprisingly, these contributions came from the ecosystem itself (i.e.,
non-maintainers of either client and library). At the project level, we find
that DC congruence shares a statistically significant relationship with the
likelihood of a package becoming dormant. Finally, by comparing source code of

noted that in case of the degenerate GS, the unsymmetrized calculations show

thermal LB models for liquid-vapor phase change, the present approach has two
advantages: for one thing, the current approach does not require calculating
the gradient of volumetric heat capacity [i.e., $\nabla \left( {\rho {c_v}}

seven discrete velocities in three dimensions (D3Q7), making the current

and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. In reality, however, this assumption
is almost always violated due to distribution shifts between environments.
Although valuable learning signals can be provided by heterogeneous data from
changing distributions, it is also known that learning under arbitrary
(adversarial) changes is impossible. Causality provides a useful framework for
modeling distribution shifts, since causal models encode both observational and
interventional distributions. In this work, we explore the sparse mechanism
shift hypothesis, which posits that distribution shifts occur due to a small
number of changing causal conditionals. Motivated by this idea, we apply it to
learning causal structure from heterogeneous environments, where i.i.d. data
only allows for learning an equivalence class of graphs without restrictive
assumptions. We propose the Mechanism Shift Score (MSS), a score-based approach
amenable to various empirical estimators, which provably identifies the entire
causal structure with high probability if the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis
holds. Empirically, we verify behavior predicted by the theory and compare
multiple estimators and score functions to identify the best approaches in
practice. Compared to other methods, we show how MSS bridges a gap by both
being nonparametric as well as explicitly leveraging sparse changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02013v2

changes in water extent and quality which indicates the locations of mining

"Are your dependencies code reviewed?: Measuring code review coverage in
  dependency updates",2022-06-19T14:48:48Z,"Nasif Imtiaz, Laurie Williams","As modern software extensively uses free open source packages as
dependencies, developers have to regularly pull in new third-party code through
frequent updates. However, without a proper review of every incoming change,
vulnerable and malicious code can sneak into the codebase through these
dependencies. The goal of this study is to aid developers in securely accepting
dependency updates by measuring if the code changes in an update have passed
through a code review process. We implement Depdive, an update audit tool for
packages in Crates.io, npm, PyPI, and RubyGems registry. Depdive first (i)
identifies the files and the code changes in an update that cannot be traced
back to the package's source repository, i.e., \textit{phantom artifacts}; and
then (ii) measures what portion of changes in the update, excluding the phantom
artifacts, has passed through a code review process, i.e., \textit{code review
coverage}.
  Using Depdive, we present an empirical study across the latest ten updates of
the most downloaded 1000 packages in each of the four registries. We further
evaluated our results through a maintainer agreement survey. We find the
updates are typically only partially code-reviewed (52.5\% of the time).
Further, only 9.0\% of the packages had all their updates in our data set fully
code-reviewed, indicating that even the most used packages can introduce
non-reviewed code in the software supply chain. We also observe that updates
either tend to have high \textit{CRC} or low \textit{CRC}, suggesting that
packages at the opposite end of the spectrum may require a separate set of
treatments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09422v2

Change of Optimal Values: A Pre-calculated Metric,2022-06-23T17:24:21Z,Fang Bai,"A variety of optimization problems takes the form of a minimum norm
optimization. In this paper, we study the change of optimal values between two
incrementally constructed least norm optimization problems, with new
measurements included in the second one. We prove an exact equation to
calculate the change of optimal values in the linear least norm optimization
problem. With the result in this paper, the change of the optimal values can be
pre-calculated as a metric to guide online decision makings, without solving
the second optimization problem as long the solution and covariance of the
first optimization problem are available. The result can be extended to linear
least distance optimization problems, and nonlinear least distance optimization
with (nonlinear) equality constraints through linearizations. This derivation
in this paper provides a theoretically sound explanation to the empirical
observations shown in RA-L 2018 bai et al. As an additional contribution, we
propose another optimization problem, i.e. aligning two trajectories at given
poses, to further demonstrate how to use the metric. The accuracy of the metric
is validated with numerical examples, which is quite satisfactory in general
(see the experiments in RA-L 2018 bai et al.} as well), unless in some
extremely adverse scenarios. Last but not least, calculating the optimal value
by the proposed metric is at least one magnitude faster than solving the
corresponding optimization problems directly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11857v1
"Reinforcement Learning Based User-Guided Motion Planning for Human-Robot
  Collaboration",2022-07-01T15:26:36Z,"Tian Yu, Qing Chang","Robots are good at performing repetitive tasks in modern manufacturing
industries. However, robot motions are mostly planned and preprogrammed with a
notable lack of adaptivity to task changes. Even for slightly changed tasks,
the whole system must be reprogrammed by robotics experts. Therefore, it is
highly desirable to have a flexible motion planning method, with which robots
can adapt to specific task changes in unstructured environments, such as
production systems or warehouses, with little or no intervention from
non-expert personnel. In this paper, we propose a user-guided motion planning
algorithm in combination with the reinforcement learning (RL) method to enable
robots automatically generate their motion plans for new tasks by learning from
a few kinesthetic human demonstrations. To achieve adaptive motion plans for a
specific application environment, e.g., desk assembly or warehouse
loading/unloading, a library is built by abstracting features of common human
demonstrated tasks. The definition of semantical similarity between features in
the library and features of a new task is proposed and further used to
construct the reward function in RL. The RL policy can automatically generate
motion plans for a new task if it determines that new task constraints can be
satisfied with the current library and request additional human demonstrations.
Multiple experiments conducted on common tasks and scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed user-guided RL-assisted motion planning method is effective.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00492v1
Amorphous Entangled Active Matter,2022-07-08T03:03:16Z,"William Savoie, Harry Tuazon, M. Saad Bhamla, Daniel I. Goldman","The design of amorphous entangled systems, specifically from soft and active
materials, has the potential to open exciting new classes of active,
shape-shifting, and task-capable 'smart' materials. However, the global
emergent mechanics that arises from the local interactions of individual
particles are not well understood. In this study, we examine the emergent
properties of amorphous entangled systems in three different examples: an
in-silico ""smarticle"" collection, its robophysical chain, and living entangled
aggregate of worm blobs (L. variegatus). In simulations, we examine how
material properties change for a collective composed of dynamic three-link
robots. We compare three methods of controlling entanglement in a collective:
externally oscillations, shape-changes, and internal oscillations. We find that
large-amplitude changes of the particle's shape using the shape-change
procedure produced the highest average number of entanglements, with respect to
the aspect ratio (l/w), improving the tensile strength of the collective. We
demonstrate application of these simulations in two experimental systems:
robotic chains and entangled worm blobs. In the robophysical models, we find
emergent auxeticity behavior upon straining the confined collective. And
finally, we show how the individual worm activity in a blob can be controlled
through the ambient dissolved oxygen in water, leading to complex emergent
properties of the living entangled collective, such as solid-like entanglement
and tumbling. Taken together, our work reveals principles by which future
shape-modulating, potentially soft robotic systems may dynamically alter their
material properties, advancing our understanding of living entangled materials,
while inspiring new classes of synthetic emergent super-materials.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03665v1

collected in modern epidemiology studies, often with the goal of informing
tailored early intervention decisions. For example, hormones such as estradiol

marker trajectories. However, subject-level biomarker variability may also
provide critical information about disease risks and health outcomes. In this
paper, we develop a joint model that estimates subject-level means and
variances of longitudinal biomarkers to predict a cross-sectional health
outcome. Simulations demonstrate excellent recovery of true model parameters.
The proposed method provides less biased and more efficient estimates, relative
to alternative approaches that either ignore subject-level differences in
variances or perform two-stage estimation where estimated marker variances are
treated as observed. Analyses of women's health data reveal larger variability

"A Bayesian Monte Carlo assessment of orbital stability in the late
  stages of planetary system formation",2022-07-15T17:25:38Z,"Jassyr Salas, Frank Bautista, Germán Chaparro","The final orbital configuration of a planetary system is shaped by both its
early star-disk environment and late-stage gravitational interactions.
Assessing the relative importance of each of these factors is not
straightforward due to the observed diversity of planetary systems compounded
by observational biases. Our goal is to understand how a planetary system may
change when planetesimal accretion and planet migrations stop and secular
gravitational effects take over. Our approach starts with a novel
classification of planetary systems based on their orbital architecture,
validated using Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We apply this scheme
to observed planetary systems and also to $\sim 400$ synthetic systems hosting
$\sim 5000$ planets, synthesized from a Monte Carlo planet population model.
Our classification scheme robustly yields four system classes according to
their planet masses and semi-major axes, for both observed and synthetic
systems. We then estimate the orbital distribution density of each of the
synthetic systems before and after dynamically evolving them for up to 1 Myr
with a gravitational+collisional $N$-body code. Using the Kullback-Leibler
divergence to statistically measure orbital configuration changes, we find that
$\lesssim 10 \%$ of synthetic planetary systems experience such changes. We
also find that this fraction belongs to a class of systems for which their
center of mass is very close to their host star. Although changes in the
orbital configuration of planetary systems may not very common, they are more
likely to happen in systems with close-in, massive planets, with F- and G-type
host-stars and stellar metallicities $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > 0.2$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07617v2
"Dynamical perturbations around an extreme mass ratio inspiral near
  resonance",2022-07-15T20:09:32Z,"Makana Silva, Christopher Hirata","Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) -- systems with a compact object
orbiting a much more massive (e.g., galactic center) black hole -- are of
interest both as a new probe of the environments of galactic nuclei, and their
waveforms are a precision test of the Kerr metric. This work focuses on the
effects of an external perturbation due to a third body around an EMRI system.
This perturbation will affect the orbit most significantly when the inner body
crosses a resonance with the outer body, and result in a change of the
conserved quantities (energy, angular momentum, and Carter constant) or
equivalently of the actions, which results in a subsequent phase shift of the
waveform that builds up over time. We present a general method for calculating
the changes in action during a resonance crossing, valid for generic orbits in
the Kerr spacetime. We show that these changes are related to the gravitational
waveforms emitted by the two bodies (quantified by the amplitudes of the Weyl
scalar $\psi_4$ at the horizon and at $\infty$) at the frequency corresponding
to the resonance. This allows us to compute changes in the action variables for
each body, without directly computing the explicit metric perturbations, and
therefore we can carry out the computation by calling an existing black hole
perturbation theory code. We show that our calculation can probe resonant
interactions in both the static and dynamical limit. We plan to use this
technique for future investigations of third-body effects in EMRIs and their
potential impact on waveforms for LISA.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07733v1
Calibration-Aware Transpilation for Variational Quantum Optimization,2022-07-17T15:35:18Z,"Yanjun Ji, Sebastian Brandhofer, Ilia Polian","Today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers support only
limited sets of available quantum gates and restricted connectivity. Therefore,
quantum algorithms must be transpiled in order to become executable on a given
NISQ computer; transpilation is a complex and computationally heavy process.
Moreover, NISQ computers are affected by noise that changes over time, and
periodic calibration provides relevant error rates that should be considered
during transpilation. Variational algorithms, which form one main class of
computations on NISQ platforms, produce a number of similar yet not identical
quantum ``ansatz'' circuits. In this work, we present a transpilation
methodology optimized for variational algorithms under potentially changing
error rates. We divide transpilation into three steps: (1) noise-unaware and
computationally heavy pre-transpilation; (2) fast noise-aware matching; and (3)
fast decomposition followed by heuristic optimization. For a complete run of a
variational algorithm under constant error rates, only step (3) needs to be
executed for each new ansatz circuit. Step (2) is required only if the error
rates reported by calibration have changed significantly since the beginning of
the computation. The most expensive Step (1) is executed only once for the
whole run. This distribution is helpful for incremental, calibration-aware
transpilation when the variational algorithm adapts its own execution to
changing error rates. Experimental results on IBM's quantum computer show the
low latency and robust results obtained by calibration-aware transpilation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08205v1

"Modeling mandatory and discretionary lane changes using dynamic
  interaction networks",2022-07-26T10:26:21Z,"Yue Zhang, Yajie Zou, Yuanchang Xie, Lei Chen","A quantitative understanding of dynamic lane-changing (LC) interaction
patterns is indispensable for improving the decision-making of autonomous
vehicles, especially in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. This paper
develops a novel framework combining the hidden Markov model and graph
structure to identify the difference in dynamic interaction networks between
mandatory lane changes (MLC) and discretionary lane changes (DLC). A hidden
Markov model is developed to decompose LC interactions into homogenous segments
and reveal the temporal properties of these segments. Then, conditional mutual
information is used to quantify the interaction intensity, and the graph
structure is used to characterize the connectivity between vehicles. Finally,
the critical vehicle in each dynamic interaction network is identified. Based
on the LC events extracted from the INTERACTION dataset, the proposed
analytical framework is applied to modeling MLC and DLC under congested traffic
with levels of service E and F. The results show that there are multiple
heterogeneous dynamic interaction network structures in an LC process. A
comparison of MLC and DLC demonstrates that MLC are more complex, while DLC are
more random. The complexity of MLC is attributed to the intense interaction and
frequent transition of the interaction network structure, while the random DLC
demonstrate no obvious evolution rules and dominant vehicles in interaction
networks. The findings in this study are useful for understanding the
connectivity structure between vehicles in LC interactions, and for designing
appropriate and well-directed driving decision-making models for autonomous

"Chaotic diffusion of asteroids in the exterior 1:2 mean motion resonance
  with Mars",2022-07-28T12:40:36Z,"Apostolos A. Christou, Stanley F. Dermott, Dan Li","The inner asteroid belt between 2.1 and 2.5 au is of particular dynamical
significance because it is the dominant source of both chondritic meteorites
and near-Earth asteroids. This inner belt is bounded by an eccentricity-type
secular resonance and by the 1:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. Unless
asteroid perihelia are low enough to allow scattering by Mars, escape requires
transport to one of the bounding resonances. In addition Yarkovsky forces are
generally ineffective in changing either the eccentricity and/or inclination
for asteroids with diameter $\gtrsim$30 km. Thus, large asteroids with
pericentres far from Mars may only escape from the inner belt through large
changes in their eccentricities. In this paper we study chaotic diffusion of
orbits near the 1:2 mean motion resonance with Mars in a systematic way. We
show that, while chaotic orbital evolution in both resonant and non-resonant
orbits increase the dispersion of the inclinations and eccentricities, it does
not significantly change their mean values. We show further that, while the
dispersive growth is greatest for resonant orbits, at high $e$ the resonance
acts to mitigate asteroid scattering by Mars - making the asteroid lifetime in
the belt longer than it would have been for a non-resonant orbit. For asteroids
of all sizes in both resonant and non-resonant orbits, the changes in
eccentricity needed to account for the observations cannot be achieved by
gravitational forces alone. The role of resonant trapping in protecting
asteroids from encounters with Mars is also analysed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14047v2
"Improving the Performance of Robust Control through Event-Triggered
  Learning",2022-07-28T17:36:37Z,"Alexander von Rohr, Friedrich Solowjow, Sebastian Trimpe","Robust controllers ensure stability in feedback loops designed under
uncertainty but at the cost of performance. Model uncertainty in time-invariant
systems can be reduced by recently proposed learning-based methods, which
improve the performance of robust controllers using data. However, in practice,
many systems also exhibit uncertainty in the form of changes over time, e.g.,
due to weight shifts or wear and tear, leading to decreased performance or
instability of the learning-based controller. We propose an event-triggered
learning algorithm that decides when to learn in the face of uncertainty in the
LQR problem with rare or slow changes. Our key idea is to switch between robust
and learned controllers. For learning, we first approximate the optimal length
of the learning phase via Monte-Carlo estimations using a probabilistic model.
We then design a statistical test for uncertain systems based on the
moment-generating function of the LQR cost. The test detects changes in the
system under control and triggers re-learning when control performance
deteriorates due to system changes. We demonstrate improved performance over a
robust controller baseline in a numerical example.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14252v2

assessment into a Question Answering problem. To tackle this problem, our
intuition is that natural language processing can provide the necessary
representations and models for assessing the semantic correlation between a bug
(question) and a patch (answer). Specifically, we consider as inputs the bug
reports as well as the natural language description of the generated patches.
Our approach, Quatrain, first considers state of the art commit message
generation models to produce the relevant inputs associated to each generated

tunneling current $J$ calculations made at helium temperature for the example
InAs-InAs-InAs, Au-GaSe-Au and Al-AlN-Al structures show that for a constant
source-drain voltage, $V_C$, of several mV, changes in the gate voltage, $V_G$,

field-effect-transistor (TFET), the proposed device uses the change of $V_G$
(gate voltage), i.e. the change of the electrostatic potential in the channel,
to modify the imaginary wave vector $k_z$ of tunnel current electrons.
Consequently, the gate voltage controls the damping force of the electrons wave
functions and thus the magnitude of the tunneling current, $J$. The effect of
increasing temperature, T, on $J(V_G)$ relation was also tested. It was found
that only in structures with a wide forbidden channel gap this effect is

due to the diverse properties of their various phases and the growing physical
understanding of LCs. Our goal is to examine the applicability of a new method
in determining these quantities for thermotropic uniaxial nematic liquid
crystals (NLCs), even though nearly all theoretical and experimental efforts
are focused on a deeper understanding of the temperature-dependent free energy
behavior and other quantities related to it, especially in the vicinity of the
first- and second-order phase transitions of LCs. The method that is being
discussed is based on Fresnel diffraction (FD) from phase objects, which has
found a wide range of precise metrological applications over the past two
decades. Diffractometry is a very sensitive, accurate, and immune technique
that can convert any change in the order of LCs as a function of temperature
into a change in the optical phase and, as a result, a recordable change in the
visibility of the light diffraction pattern from phase steps. This contrasts
with interferometry, which is very sensitive to environmental changes.
Theoretical investigations, numerical calculations, and comparisons of the
results with experimental observations in turn demonstrate very high compliance
with the output of other existing methods. As we will see, this method has the

are micro-scale changes caused by photoisomerization at the nanoscale and lead
to the realization of important functions as optical devices. However, the

than cusp catastrophe, from the seven elementary catastrophes that can describe
discontinuities in the phenomena. By introducing the hyperbolic operating
curves in the model, intrinsic properties of the photochromic crystals are

photosalient, are systematically classified by the proposed catastrophe model,

evaluated the device figures of merit (FOM), such as threshold voltage,

changes in the FOM are mainly attributed to work function changes on the gate

semiconductor trap density. The shift in threshold voltage and decrease in
mobility are found to be linear as a function of measurement cycles and caused
by electrical stress, with time immersed in water having a negligible effect on
the device. The trap density-of-states estimated using the subthreshold slope

  Networks",2022-08-31T14:11:23Z,"Junqi Jiang, Francesco Leofante, Antonio Rago, Francesca Toni","The use of counterfactual explanations (CFXs) is an increasingly popular
explanation strategy for machine learning models. However, recent studies have
shown that these explanations may not be robust to changes in the underlying
model (e.g., following retraining), which raises questions about their
reliability in real-world applications. Existing attempts towards solving this
problem are heuristic, and the robustness to model changes of the resulting
CFXs is evaluated with only a small number of retrained models, failing to
provide exhaustive guarantees. To remedy this, we propose {\Delta}-robustness,
the first notion to formally and deterministically assess the robustness (to
model changes) of CFXs for neural networks. We introduce an abstraction
framework based on interval neural networks to verify the {\Delta}-robustness
of CFXs against a possibly infinite set of changes to the model parameters,
i.e., weights and biases. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach in
two distinct ways. First, we analyse the {\Delta}-robustness of a number of CFX
generation methods from the literature and show that they unanimously host
significant deficiencies in this regard. Second, we demonstrate how embedding
{\Delta}-robustness within existing methods can provide CFXs which are provably
robust.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14878v3
"General theory of emergent elasticity for second-order topological phase
  transitions",2022-09-03T02:15:49Z,Yangfan Hu,"The raise of the symmetry breaking mechanism by Landau[1] is a landmark in
the studies of phase transitions. The Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition[2-3]
and the fractional quantum Hall effect[4], however, are believed to be induced
by another mechanism: topology change. Despite rapid development of the theory
of topological orders[5-7], a unified theoretical framework describing this new
paradigm of phase transition and its relation to the Landau paradigm, is not
seen. Here, we establish such a framework based on variational principle, and
show that the critical condition for any second-order topological phase
transitions is loss of positive-definiteness of a topologically protected
second-order variation of the free energy. A topologically protected variation
of a field solution is performed with respect to its emergent displacements,
which is introduced by constructing an emergent elasticity problem for the
solution. The Landau paradigm of phase transitions studies global property
changes induced instability, while topological phase transitions study local
property changes induced topological instability. The general effectiveness of
this criterion is shown through analyzing the topological stability of several
prototype solutions in both real space (two-kink solutions of the sine-Gordon
model; an isolated skyrmion in chiral magnets) and reciprocal space (phonon
spectrum of a monoatomic chain and a diatomic chain; band structure of a
monoatomic chain within the Kronig-Penny model). Every field is emergent
elastic with spatially modulated stiffness, and changes of topological property
occur at its softened points. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for
a general study of topological phase transitions in all field theories.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01214v2

Change Detection for Local Explainability in Evolving Data Streams,2022-09-06T18:38:34Z,"Johannes Haug, Alexander Braun, Stefan Zürn, Gjergji Kasneci","As complex machine learning models are increasingly used in sensitive
applications like banking, trading or credit scoring, there is a growing demand
for reliable explanation mechanisms. Local feature attribution methods have
become a popular technique for post-hoc and model-agnostic explanations.
However, attribution methods typically assume a stationary environment in which
the predictive model has been trained and remains stable. As a result, it is
often unclear how local attributions behave in realistic, constantly evolving
settings such as streaming and online applications. In this paper, we discuss
the impact of temporal change on local feature attributions. In particular, we
show that local attributions can become obsolete each time the predictive model
is updated or concept drift alters the data generating distribution.
Consequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high
explanatory power only when combined with a mechanism that allows us to detect
and respond to local changes over time. To this end, we present CDLEEDS, a
flexible and model-agnostic framework for detecting local change and concept
drift. CDLEEDS serves as an intuitive extension of attribution-based
explanation techniques to identify outdated local attributions and enable more
targeted recalculations. In experiments, we also show that the proposed
framework can reliably detect both local and global concept drift. Accordingly,
our work contributes to a more meaningful and robust explainability in online
machine learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02764v1

  dusty plasma",2022-09-08T12:52:34Z,"L. B. De Toni, R. Gaelzer, L. F. Ziebell","In this work we investigate the characteristics of the group velocity of
obliquely propagating Alfv\'en waves in a dusty plasma typical of a stellar
wind. The dispersion relation is derived with the aid of the kinetic theory for
a magnetized dusty plasma consisting of electrons and ions, with distribution
of momenta described by a Maxwellian function. The dust particles are
considered to be immobile and have all the same size; they are electrically
charged by absorption of plasma particles via inelastic collisions and by
photoionization. We numerically solve the dispersion relation and calculate the
components of group velocity (along and transverse to the magnetic field) for
the normal modes, namely the compressional and shear Alfv\'en waves (CAW and
SAW). The results show that the direction of the group velocity of CAWs is
greatly modified with the wave-vector direction. On the other hand, SAWs will
present group velocity propagating practically along the magnetic field. The
changes in dust parameters, such as number density and equilibrium electrical
charge, may significantly change the waves' characteristics. It is seen that
for sufficiently high dust to ion number density ratio, the SAWs may present
perpendicular group velocity propagating in opposite direction to the
perpendicular phase velocity, in a small interval of wavenumber values; we also
notice that this interval may change, or even vanish, when the flux of
radiation incident on the dust is altered, changing the equilibrium electrical
charge of the grains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03784v1

  kagome magnet",2022-09-09T06:14:33Z,Kangkang Li,"The Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model on various lattices have attracted a lot of
attention because they may lead to exotic states such as quantum spin liquid

q=0}$, $120^\circ$ order and canted ferromagnetic (CFM) order, respectively.
Interestingly, the HK model on the KL has the same ground state long-range
orders. In the theoretical phase diagram, the CFM phase resides in a continuous
parameter region and there is no phase change across special parameter points,
such as the Kitaev ferromagnetic (KFM) point, the ferromagnetic (FM) point and
its dual FM point. However, a ground state property cannot distinguish a system
with or without topological nontrivial excitations and related phase
transitions. Here, we study the topological magnon excitations and related
thermal Hall conductivity in the HK model on the KL with CFM order. The CFM
phase can be divided into two regions related by the Klein duality, with the
self dual KFM point as their boundary. We find that the scalar spin chirality
which is intrinsic in the CFM order changes sign across the KFM point. This
leads to the opposite Chern numbers of corresponding magnon bands in the two

Using Genetic Algorithms to Simulate Evolution,2022-09-14T00:23:06Z,Manasa Josyula,"Evolution is the theory that plants and animals today have come from kinds
that have existed in the past. Scientists such as Charles Darwin and Alfred
Wallace dedicate their life to observe how species interact with their
environment, grow, and change. We are able to predict future changes as well as
simulate the process using genetic algorithms. Genetic Algorithms give us the
opportunity to present multiple variables and parameters to an environment and
change values to simulate different situations. By optimizing genetic
algorithms to hold entities in an environment, we are able to assign varying
characteristics such as speed, size, and cloning probability, to the entities
to simulate real natural selection and evolution in a shorter period of time.
Learning about how species grow and evolve allows us to find ways to improve
technology, help animals going extinct to survive, and figure* out how diseases
spread and possible ways of making an environment uninhabitable for them. Using
data from an environment including genetic algorithms and parameters of speed,
size, and cloning percentage, the ability to test several changes in the
environment and observe how the species interacts within it appears. After
testing different environments with a varied amount of food while keeping the
number of starting population at 10 entities, it was found that an environment

Towards Robust Off-Policy Evaluation via Human Inputs,2022-09-18T23:59:55Z,"Harvineet Singh, Shalmali Joshi, Finale Doshi-Velez, Himabindu Lakkaraju","Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are crucial tools for evaluating policies
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often
infeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected
to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods
to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing
approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can
arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often
results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating
policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address
the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help
provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage
human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and
adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically,
we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a
subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case
utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient
algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual
bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample
complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and
real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach
not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less
pessimistic policy evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08682v1
The fate of baryons in counterfactual universes,2022-09-19T06:23:11Z,"Boon Kiat Oh, John A. Peacock, Sadegh Khochfar, Britton D. Smith","We present results from nine simulations that compare the standard $\Lambda$
Cold Dark Matter cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) with counterfactual universes, for
approximately $100\,{\rm Gyr}$ using the Enzo simulation code. We vary the
value of $\Lambda$ and the fluctuation amplitude to explore the effect on the
evolution of the halo mass function (HMF), the intergalactic medium (IGM) and
the star formation history (SFH). The distinct peak in star formation rate
density (SFRD) and its subsequent decline are both affected by the interplay
between gravitational attraction and the accelerating effects of $\Lambda$. The
IGM cools down more rapidly in models with a larger $\Lambda$ and also with a
lower $\sigma_8$, reflecting the reduced SFRD associated with these changes --
although changing $\sigma_8$ is not degenerate with changing $\Lambda$, either
regarding the thermal history of the IGM or the SFH. However, these induced
changes to the IGM or ionizing background have little impact on the calculated
SFRD. We provide fits for the evolution of the SFRD in these different
universes, which we integrate over time to derive an asymptotic star formation
efficiency. Together with Weinberg's uniform prior on $\Lambda$, the estimated
probability of observers experiencing a value of $\Lambda$ no greater than the
observed value is 13%, substantially larger than some alternative estimates.
Within the Enzo model framework, then, observer selection within a multiverse
is able to account statistically for the small value of the cosmological
constant, although $\Lambda$ in our universe does appear to be at the low end
of the predicted range.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08783v1

optical absorption, optical scattering, and mechanical loss, with higher
temperature annealing giving better results. The achievable maximum
temperatures are limited to the levels at which coating damage, such as
crystallization, cracking, or bubbling will occur. Coating damage caused by
heating is typically only observed statically, after annealing. An experimental
method to dynamically observe how and over what temperature range such damage
occurs during annealing is desirable as its results could inform manufacturing
and annealing processes to ultimately achieve better coating performance. We
developed a new instrument that features an industrial annealing oven with
holes cut into its sides for viewports to illuminate optical samples and
observe their coating scatter and eventual damage mechanisms in-situ and in
real-time during annealing. We present results that demonstrate in-situ
observation of changes to titania-doped tantala coatings on fused silica
substrates. We obtain a spatial image (mapping) of the evolution of these
changes during annealing, an advantage over x-ray diffraction, electron beam,

limited by its design. In many cases, changing the gripper fingers is required
to successfully conduct multiple consecutive tasks. For this reason, several
robotic tool change systems have been introduced that allow an automatic
changing of the entire end-effector. However, many situations require only the
modification or the change of the fingertip, making the exchange of the entire
gripper uneconomic. In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for automatic
task-specific fingertip production. The setup used in the proposed framework
consists of a production and task execution unit, containing a robotic
manipulator, and two 3D printers - autonomously producing the gripper fingers.
It also consists of a second manipulator that uses a quick-exchange mechanism
to pick up the printed fingertips and evaluates gripping performance. The setup
is experimentally validated by conducting automatic production of three
different fingertips and executing graspstability tests as well as multiple
pick- and insertion tasks, with and without position offsets - using these
fingertips. The proposed paradigm, indeed, goes beyond fingertip production and
serves as a foundation for a fully automatic fingertip design, production and

from the various browser or device properties. Academic work has covered
offensive and defensive fingerprinting methods for almost a decade, observing a
rise in popularity. This thesis explores the current state of browser
fingerprinting on the internet. For that, we implement FPNET - a scalable &
reliable tool based on FPMON, to identify fingerprinting scripts on large sets
of websites by observing their behavior. By scanning the Alexa Top 10,000
websites, we spot several hundred networks of equally behaving scripts. For
each network, we determine the actor behind it. We track down companies like
Google, Yandex, Maxmind, Sift, or FingerprintJS, to name a few. In three
complementary studies, we further investigate the uncovered networks with
regards to I) randomization of filenames or domains, II) behavior changes, III)
security. Two consecutive scans reveal that only less than 12.5% of the pages
do not change script files. With our behavior-based approach, we successfully
re-identify almost 9,000 scripts whose filename or domain changed, and over 86%
of the scripts without URL changes. The security analysis shows an adoption of
TLS/SSL to over 98% and specific web security headers set for over 30% of the

Propagating the asteroids' coupled orbit and rigid body attitude dynamics
through the flyby, we present the range of possible post-flyby spin states.
These spin state distributions will be valuable for planning Apophis
observation campaigns and spacecraft missions, most notably OSIRIS-APEX. The
simulations indicate that gravitationally induced changes to the asteroid's
tumbling periods and rotational angular momentum direction (pole) will likely
be significant and measurable. For the current spin state and inertia estimates
and their uncertainties, Apophis is likely to remain in a short axis mode (SAM)
tumbling state but its effective spin rate could halve or double. Its pole is
likely to shift by 10 degrees or more and increase in longitude while moving
closer to the ecliptic plane. These spin state changes are very sensitive to
the asteroid's close approach attitude and mass distribution. With ground-based
tracking of the asteroid's spin state through the encounter, this sensitivity
will help refine mass distribution knowledge. We also discuss the implications
of this abrupt spin state alteration for Apophis' Yarkovsky acceleration and
geophysical properties, identifying possible pathways for surface and internal
changes, most notably if Apophis is a contact binary. Comparison of the pre and

Temporally Disentangled Representation Learning,2022-10-24T23:02:49Z,"Weiran Yao, Guangyi Chen, Kun Zhang","Recently in the field of unsupervised representation learning, strong
identifiability results for disentanglement of causally-related latent
variables have been established by exploiting certain side information, such as
class labels, in addition to independence. However, most existing work is
constrained by functional form assumptions such as independent sources or
further with linear transitions, and distribution assumptions such as
stationary, exponential family distribution. It is unknown whether the
underlying latent variables and their causal relations are identifiable if they
have arbitrary, nonparametric causal influences in between. In this work, we
establish the identifiability theories of nonparametric latent causal processes
from their nonlinear mixtures under fixed temporal causal influences and
analyze how distribution changes can further benefit the disentanglement. We

data under stationary environments and under different distribution shifts.
Specifically, the framework can factorize unknown distribution shifts into
transition distribution changes under fixed and time-varying latent causal
relations, and under observation changes in observation. Through experiments,
we show that time-delayed latent causal influences are reliably identified and
that our approach considerably outperforms existing baselines that do not

uncertainty and incorrect behavior. Owing to the increased use of image
recognition tasks in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and
medical imaging, it is imperative to assess their robustness to changes in the
computational environment as parameters like deep learning frameworks, compiler
optimizations for code generation, and hardware devices are not regulated with

label and inference time for changes in each of these environment parameters.
We find that output label predictions for all four models are sensitive to
choice of deep learning framework (by up to 57%) and insensitive to other

  Behavior",2022-11-02T17:16:59Z,"Xishun Liao, Xuanpeng Zhao, Ziran Wang, Zhouqiao Zhao, Kyungtae Han, Rohit Gupta, Matthew J. Barth, Guoyuan Wu","Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are supposed to share the road with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a foreseeable future. Therefore, considering
the mixed traffic environment is more pragmatic, as the well-planned operation
of CAVs may be interrupted by HDVs. In the circumstance that human behaviors
have significant impacts, CAVs need to understand HDV behaviors to make safe
actions. In this study, we develop a Driver Digital Twin (DDT) for the online
prediction of personalized lane change behavior, allowing CAVs to predict
surrounding vehicles' behaviors with the help of the digital twin technology.
DDT is deployed on a vehicle-edge-cloud architecture, where the cloud server
models the driver behavior for each HDV based on the historical naturalistic
driving data, while the edge server processes the real-time data from each
driver with his/her digital twin on the cloud to predict the lane change
maneuver. The proposed system is first evaluated on a human-in-the-loop
co-simulation platform, and then in a field implementation with three passenger
vehicles connected through the 4G/LTE cellular network. The lane change
intention can be recognized in 6 seconds on average before the vehicle crosses
the lane separation line, and the Mean Euclidean Distance between the predicted
trajectory and GPS ground truth is 1.03 meters within a 4-second prediction
window. Compared to the general model, using a personalized model can improve
prediction accuracy by 27.8%. The demonstration video of the proposed system

Research on the impact of asteroid mining on global equity,2022-10-18T13:34:22Z,"He Sun, Junfeng Zhu, Yipeng Xu","In the future situation, aiming to seek more resources, human beings decided
to march towards the mysterious and bright starry sky, which opened the era of
great interstellar exploration. According to the Outer Space Treaty, any
exploration of celestial bodies should be aimed at promoting global equality

Unified Equity Index (UEI) model to measure it. We merge the factors with
greater correlation, and finally, get 6 elements, and then use the entropy
method (TEM) to find the dispersion of these elements in different countries.
Then use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the

Secondly, we simulated a future with asteroid mining and evaluated its impact
on Unified Equity Index (UEI). Then, we divided the mineable asteroids into
three classes with different mining difficulties and values, identified 28
mining entities including private companies, national and international
organizations. We considered changes in the asteroid classes, mining
capabilities and mining scales to determine the changes in the value of
minerals mined between 2025 and 2085. We convert mining output value into
mineral transaction value through allocation matrix. Based on grey relational

Doubly Inhomogeneous Reinforcement Learning,2022-11-08T03:41:14Z,"Liyuan Hu, Mengbing Li, Chengchun Shi, Zhenke Wu, Piotr Fryzlewicz","This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in doubly inhomogeneous
environments under temporal non-stationarity and subject heterogeneity. In a
number of applications, it is commonplace to encounter datasets generated by
system dynamics that may change over time and population, challenging
high-quality sequential decision making. Nonetheless, most existing RL
solutions require either temporal stationarity or subject homogeneity, which
would result in sub-optimal policies if both assumptions were violated. To
address both challenges simultaneously, we propose an original algorithm to
determine the ``best data chunks"" that display similar dynamics over time and
across individuals for policy learning, which alternates between most recent
change point detection and cluster identification. Our method is general, and
works with a wide range of clustering and change point detection algorithms. It
is multiply robust in the sense that it takes multiple initial estimators as
input and only requires one of them to be consistent. Moreover, by borrowing
information over time and population, it allows us to detect weaker signals and
has better convergence properties when compared to applying the clustering
algorithm per time or the change point detection algorithm per subject.
Empirically, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method through extensive

On topology changes in quantum field theory and quantum gravity,2022-11-13T21:02:07Z,Benjamin Schulz,"Two singularity theorems can be proven if one attempts to let a Lorentzian
cobordism interpolate between two topologically distinct manifolds. On the
other hand, Cartier and DeWitt-Morette have given a rigorous definition for
quantum field theories (qfts) by means of path integrals. This article uses
their results to study whether qfts can be made compatible with topology
changes. We show that path integrals over metrics need a finite norm for the
latter and for degenerate metrics, this problem can sometimes be resolved with
tetrads. We prove that already in the neighborhood of some cuspidal
singularities, difficulties can arise to define certain qfts. On the other
hand, we show that simple qfts can be defined around conical singularities that
result from a topology change in a simple setup. We argue that the ground state
of many theories of quantum gravity will imply a small cosmological constant
and, during the expansion of the universe, will cause frequent topology
changes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to describe the transition amplitudes
consistently due to the aforementioned problems. We argue that one needs to
describe qfts by stochastic differential equations, and in the case of gravity,
by Regge calculus in order to resolve this problem.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07017v2
Evaluating Search-Based Software Microbenchmark Prioritization,2022-11-24T10:45:39Z,"Christoph Laaber, Tao Yue, Shaukat Ali","Ensuring that software performance does not degrade after a code change is
paramount. A solution is to regularly execute software microbenchmarks, a
performance testing technique similar to (functional) unit tests, which,
however, often becomes infeasible due to extensive runtimes. To address that
challenge, research has investigated regression testing techniques, such as
test case prioritization (TCP), which reorder the execution within a
microbenchmark suite to detect larger performance changes sooner. Such
techniques are either designed for unit tests and perform sub-par on
microbenchmarks or require complex performance models, drastically reducing
their potential application. In this paper, we empirically evaluate single- and
multi-objective search-based microbenchmark prioritization techniques to
understand whether they are more effective and efficient than greedy,
coverage-based techniques. For this, we devise three search objectives, i.e.,
coverage to maximize, coverage overlap to minimize, and historical performance
change detection to maximize. We find that search algorithms (SAs) are only
competitive with but do not outperform the best greedy, coverage-based
baselines. However, a simple greedy technique utilizing solely the performance
change history (without coverage information) is equally or more effective than
the best coverage-based techniques while being considerably more efficient,
with a runtime overhead of less than 1%. These results show that simple,
non-coverage-based techniques are a better fit for microbenchmarks than complex

"""Stochastic Inverse Problems"" and Changes-of-Variables",2022-11-28T19:27:40Z,"Peter W. Marcy, Rebecca E. Morrison","Over the last decade, a series of applied mathematics papers have explored a

whose pushforward takes a given form. The formulation of such a stochastic
inverse problem can be unexpected or confusing to those familiar with
traditional Bayesian or otherwise statistical inference. To date, two classes
of solutions have been proposed, and these have only been justified through
applications of measure theory and its disintegration theorem. In this work we
show that, under mild assumptions, the formulation of and solution to all
stochastic inverse problems can be more clearly understood using basic
probability theory: a stochastic inverse problem is simply a
change-of-variables or approximation thereof. For the two existing classes of
solutions, we derive the relationship to change(s)-of-variables and illustrate
using analytic examples where none had previously existed. Our derivations use
neither Bayes' theorem nor the disintegration theorem explicitly. Our final

planetary systems around young stars. Their main constituent is amorphous solid
water (ASW). Although ASW is widely studied, vibrational energy dissipation and
structural changes due to vibrational excitation are less well understood. The
hydrogen-bonding network is likely a crucial component in this. Here we present
experimental results on hydrogen-bonding changes in ASW induced by the intense,
nearly monochromatic mid-IR free-electron laser (FEL) radiation of the FELIX-2
beamline at the HFML-FELIX facility at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the
Netherlands. Structural changes in ASW are monitored by reflection-absorption
infrared spectroscopy and depend on the irradiation history of the ice. The
experiments show that FEL irradiation can induce changes in the local
neighborhood of the excited molecules due to energy transfer. Molecular
Dynamics simulations confirm this picture: vibrationally excited molecules can
reorient for a more optimal tetrahedral surrounding without breaking existing
hydrogen bonds. The vibrational energy can transfer through the
hydrogen-bonding network to water molecules that have the same vibrational
frequency. We hence expect a reduced energy dissipation in amorphous material
with respect to crystalline material due to the inhomogeneity in vibrational
frequencies as well as the presence of specific hydrogen-bonding defect sites

The main limitations of the existing device model lie in (1) unable to update
due to the computation limit of the device, (2) the limited generalization
ability of the lightweight model. Meanwhile, recent large models have shown
strong generalization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on
client devices due to poor computation constraints. To enable the device model
to deal with changing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm of
Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which encourages collaboration
between cloud and device and improves the generalization of the device model.
Based on this paradigm, we further propose an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt

distribution closer to the cloud training distribution. We conduct extensive

A Red Giants' Toy Story II: Understanding the Red-Giant Branch Bump,2022-12-15T18:46:51Z,Marcelo M. Miller Bertolami,"The Red-Giant Branch Bump (RGBB) is one of the most noteworthy features in
the red-giant luminosity function of stellar clusters. It is caused by the
passage of the hydrogen-burning shell through the composition discontinuity
left at the point of the deepest penetration by the convective envelope. When
crossing the discontinuity the usual trend in increasing luminosity reverses
for a short time before it increases again, causing a zig-zag in the
evolutionary track. In spite of its apparent simplicity the actual physical
reason behind the decrease in luminosity is not well understood and several
different explanations have been offered. Here we use a recently proposed
simple toy-model for the structure of low-mass red giants, together with
previous results, to show beyond reasonable doubt that the change in luminosity
at the RGBB can be traced to the change in the mean molecular weight of the
layers on top of the burning shell. And that these changes happen on a nuclear
timescale. The change in the effective mean molecular weight, as the burning
shell approaches the discontinuity, causes a drop in the temperature of the
burning shell which is attenuated by the consequent feedback contraction of the
layers immediately below the burning shell. Our work shows that, when applied
correctly, including the feedback on the structure of the core together with of
the increase in the mass of the core, shell-source homology relations do a
great quantitative job in explaining the properties of full evolutionary models
at the RGBB.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08042v1

Modeling Vascular Branching Alterations in Polycystic Kidney Disease,2022-12-20T14:12:56Z,Timothy L. Kline,"The analysis of biological networks encompasses a wide variety of fields from
genomic research of protein-protein interaction networks, to the physiological
study of biologically optimized tree-like vascular networks. It is certain that
different biological networks have different optimization criteria and we are
interested in those networks optimized for fluid transport within the
circulatory system. Many theories currently exist. For instance, distributive
vascular geometry data is typically consistent with a theoretical model that
requires simultaneous minimization of both the power loss of laminar flow and a
cost function proportional to the total volume of material needed to maintain
the system (Murray's law). However, how this optimized system breaks down (or
is altered) due to disease has yet to be characterized in detail in terms of
branching geometry and geometric interrelationships. This is important for
understanding how vasculature remodels under changes of functional demands. For
instance, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), drastic cyst development may lead
to a significant alteration of the vascular geometry (or vascular changes may
be a preceding event). Understanding these changes could lead to a better
understanding of early disease as well as development and characterization of
treatment interventions. We have developed an optimal transport network model
which simulates distributive vascular systems in health as well as disease in
order to better understand changes that may occur due to PKD. We found that
reduced perfusion territories, dilated distributive vasculature, and vessel
rarefaction are all consequences of cyst development derived from this
theoretical model and are a direct result of the increased heterogeneity of
local renal tissue perfusion demands.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07179v1

network-based lane changing. To prevent over conservative planning, we identify
the driving behavior of surrounding vehicles and assess their aggressiveness,
and then adapt the planned trajectory for the ego vehicle accordingly in an
interactive manner. The ego vehicle can proceed to change lanes if a safe
evasion trajectory exists even in the predicted worst case; otherwise, it can
stay around the current lateral position or return back to the original lane.
We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our planner design and its
advantage over baseline methods through extensive simulations with diverse and
comprehensive experimental settings, as well as in real-world scenarios
collected by an autonomous vehicle company.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09112v2
"LSNet: Extremely Light-Weight Siamese Network For Change Detection in
  Remote Sensing Image",2022-01-23T01:42:49Z,"Biyuan Liu, Huaixin Chen, Zhixi Wang","The Siamese network is becoming the mainstream in change detection of remote
sensing images (RSI). However, in recent years, the development of more
complicated structure, module and training processe has resulted in the
cumbersome model, which hampers their application in large-scale RSI
processing. To this end, this paper proposes an extremely lightweight Siamese
network (LSNet) for RSI change detection, which replaces standard convolution
with depthwise separable atrous convolution, and removes redundant dense
connections, retaining only valid feature flows while performing Siamese
feature fusion, greatly compressing parameters and computation amount. Compared
with the first-place model on the CCD dataset, the parameters and the

Long-term multiband optical variability of S5 0716+714 blazar,2022-01-23T15:43:18Z,"Mark A. Gorbachev, Marina S. Butuzova, Sergey G. Sergeev, Sergey V. Nazarov, Alexey V. Zhovtan","Multiband optical photometry data of blazar S5 0716+714 obtained from 2002 to
2019 reveal stable color index change with flux variability. We analyzed this
trend under variability caused by the Doppler factor change in the presence of
a curved photon energy spectrum. A break in the energy spectrum of emitting
electrons, caused by radiative losses, or log-parabolic electron energy
distribution, or the synchrotron self-absorption acting in a compact jet part
forms such the photon spectrum. We explained the observed color index change
with variability by geometric effects only under the assumption that the
radiating region is the synchrotron self-absorbed core and the bright optically
thin jet. In this framework, we estimated the magnetic field strength in the
optically thick part of the radiating region. These values correspond to other
independent estimates of the magnetic field near the black hole, further
supporting our assumption.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09294v1

dioxide emissions, demographic trends and economic patterns across 50 countries

introduce a new method to classify countries into one of three characteristic
emissions classes based on a one, two or three-segment piecewise linear model.
We reveal that most countries are best represented by a piecewise linear model
with one change point. Next, we perform a decade-by-decade study of carbon
dioxide trajectories. There, we demonstrate notable changes in cluster
structures in each decade. We then study the spatial propagation of emissions
over time, highlighting a peak in spatial dispersion in 2000, beyond which
there has been a gradual decline in spatial emissions variance over space.
Finally, we use carbon dioxide, GDP, and population data and apply
dimensionality reduction and clustering to group countries based on similarity

mixed impact of involving more sensors into the decision and enables us to find
near optimal choices of parameters in the two schemes. Notably, it is shown
that, in contrast to the homogeneous setting, the first alarm rule may no

factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide
clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of

individuals with a negative personal experience during a crisis become more
pro-welfare spending, in particular for policies they perceive will benefit

shocks or the mere exposure to the crisis doesn't have a similar effect; (3)
policy preferences and institutional trust can change quickly after a negative
experience; and (4) consuming partisan media can mitigate or exacerbate these
effects by distorting perceptions of reality. In an experiment, we find that
exposing individuals to the same information can recalibrate distorted
perceptions with lasting effects. Using a machine learning model to test for
heterogeneous treatment effects, we find a negative personal experience did not
make individuals more responsive to the information treatment, suggesting that

"ROLL: Long-Term Robust LiDAR-based Localization With Temporary Mapping
  in Changing Environments",2022-03-08T08:43:02Z,"Bin Peng, Hongle Xie, Weidong Chen","Long-term scene changes present challenges to localization systems using a
pre-built map. This paper presents a LiDAR-based system that can provide robust
localization against those challenges. Our method starts with activation of a
mapping process temporarily when global matching towards the pre-built map is
unreliable. The temporary map will be merged onto the pre-built map for later
localization runs once reliable matching is obtained again. We further
integrate a LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) to provide motion-compensated LiDAR
scans and a reliable initial pose guess for the global matching module. To
generate a smooth real-time trajectory for navigation purposes, we fuse poses
from odometry and global matching by solving a pose graph optimization problem.
We evaluate our localization system with extensive experiments on the NCLT
dataset including a variety of changing indoor and outdoor environments, and
the results demonstrate a robust and accurate localization performance for over
a year. The implementations are open sourced on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03923v1
RC-MVSNet: Unsupervised Multi-View Stereo with Neural Rendering,2022-03-08T09:24:05Z,"Di Chang, Aljaž Božič, Tong Zhang, Qingsong Yan, Yingcong Chen, Sabine Süsstrunk, Matthias Nießner","Finding accurate correspondences among different views is the Achilles' heel
of unsupervised Multi-View Stereo (MVS). Existing methods are built upon the
assumption that corresponding pixels share similar photometric features.
However, multi-view images in real scenarios observe non-Lambertian surfaces
and experience occlusions. In this work, we propose a novel approach with
neural rendering (RC-MVSNet) to solve such ambiguity issues of correspondences
among views. Specifically, we impose a depth rendering consistency loss to
constrain the geometry features close to the object surface to alleviate
occlusions. Concurrently, we introduce a reference view synthesis loss to
generate consistent supervision, even for non-Lambertian surfaces. Extensive
experiments on DTU and Tanks\&Temples benchmarks demonstrate that our RC-MVSNet

warm dense matter research, for example as an input to hydrodynamics
simulations and Monte-Carlo simulations. Unfortunately, however, the best way
to compute the MIS remains an open question. Average-atom (AA) models are
widely-used in this context due to their computational efficiency, but as we
show here, the canonical approach for calculating the MIS in AA models is
typically insufficient. We therefore explore three alternative approaches to
compute the MIS. Firstly, we modify the canonical approach to change the way
electrons are partitioned into bound and free states; secondly, we develop a
novel approach using the electron localization function; finally, we extend a
method which uses the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity to our average-atom model.
Through comparisons with higher-fidelity simulations and experimental data, we
find that any of the three new methods usually out-performs the canonical

Stochastic Video Prediction with Structure and Motion,2022-03-20T11:29:46Z,"Adil Kaan Akan, Sadra Safadoust, Fatma Güney","While stochastic video prediction models enable future prediction under
uncertainty, they mostly fail to model the complex dynamics of real-world

moving camera and independently moving foreground objects in driving scenarios.
The existing methods fail to fully capture the dynamics of the structured world
by only focusing on changes in pixels. In this paper, we assume that there is
an underlying process creating observations in a video and propose to factorize
it into static and dynamic components. We model the static part based on the
scene structure and the ego-motion of the vehicle, and the dynamic part based
on the remaining motion of the dynamic objects. By learning separate
distributions of changes in foreground and background, we can decompose the

explicitly probing individual nodes of the tree. This framework captures the
tradeoff between the complexity of maintaining an up-to-date view of the

results allow for both randomized and adversarial evolution of the data,

literature on the past four decades of technological change and its impact on
employment, distinguishing between five broad technology categories (ICT,

compensating mechanisms that create or reinstate labor. This holds for most
types of technology, suggesting that previous anxieties over widespread

curvature-driven growth and interfacial noise. The kinetically constrained
zealots are formed well inside the clusters, away from the different opinions

concentrate in a region around the interfaces and their number, that is related
with the distance between the surface and the zealotry bulk, depends on the
rate the confidence changes. Despite this interface being rough and fragmented,

of crime, and gender. The story will help to uncover whether the areas
associated with crime are due to demographic or income variance. In showing the
details of crimes in Los Angeles along with the factors at play we hope to see
a compelling relationship between crime rates and recent events from 2020 to
the present, along with changes in crime type trends during these periods. We

"Stable topological phase transitions without symmetry indications in
  NaZnSb$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$",2022-04-09T11:00:58Z,"Jaemo Jung, Dongwook Kim, Youngkuk Kim","We study topological phase transitions in tetragonal NaZnSb$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$,
driven by the chemical composition $x$. Notably, we examine mirror Chern
numbers that change without symmetry indicators. First-principles calculations
are performed to show that NaZnSb$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ experiences consecutive
topological phase transitions, diagnosed by the strong $\mathbb Z_{2}$
topological index $\nu_{0}$ and two mirror Chern numbers $\mu_{x}$ and
$\mu_{xy}$. As the chemical composition $x$ increases, the topological
invariants ($\mu_{x}\mu_{xy}\nu_{0}$) change from $(000)$, $(020)$, $(220)$, to
$(111)$ at $x$ = 0.15, 0.20, and 0.53, respectively. A simplified low-energy
effective model is developed to examine the mirror Chern number changes,
highlighting the central role of spectator Dirac fermions in avoiding symmetry

"Effect of compositional fluctuation on the survival of bet-hedging
  species",2022-04-10T04:31:26Z,"Xiao Zhou, BingKan Xue","Understanding the coexistence of diverse species in a changing environment is
an important problem in community ecology. Bet-hedging is a strategy that helps
species survive in such changing environments. However, studies of bet-hedging
have often focused on the expected long-term growth rate of the species by
itself, neglecting competition with other coexisting species. Here we study the
extinction risk of a bet-hedging species in competition with others. We show
that there are three contributions to the extinction risk. The first is the
usual demographic fluctuation due to stochastic reproduction and selection
processes in finite populations. The second, due to the fluctuation of
population growth rate caused by environmental changes, may counterintuitively
reduce the extinction risk for small populations. Besides those two, we reveal
a third contribution, which is unique to bet-hedging species that diversify
into multiple phenotypes: The phenotype composition of the population will
fluctuate over time, resulting in increased extinction risk. We compare such
compositional fluctuation to the demographic and environmental contributions,
showing how they have different effects on the extinction risk depending on the
population size, generation overlap, and environmental correlation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04598v1

capacity change ($\Delta C_p = 1050\pm50$ cal/mol$\cdot$K) at low ionic
strength conditions. From the measured unfolding and folding kinetic rates, we
also determine the thermodynamic properties of the transition state, finding a
significant change in $\Delta C_p$ ($\sim$ 90$\%$) between the unfolded and the

illumination-invariant active camera relocalization method, it improves both in
relative pose estimation and scale estimation. We use plane segments as an
intermediate representation to facilitate feature matching, thus further
boosting pose estimation robustness and reliability under lighting variances.
Moreover, we construct a linear system to obtain the absolute scale in each ACR
iteration by minimizing the image warping error, thus, significantly reduce the

Can Voters Detect Errors on Their Printed Ballots? Absolutely,2022-04-20T20:40:32Z,"Philip Kortum, Michael D. Byrne, Chidera O. Azubike, Laura E. Roty","There is still debate on whether voters can detect malicious changes in their
printed ballot after making their selections on a Ballot Marking Device (BMD).
In this study, we altered votes on a voter's ballot after they had made their
selections on a BMD. We then required them to examine their ballots for any
changes from the slate they used to vote. Overall accuracy was exceptionally
high. Participants saw 1440 total contests, and of those 1440, there were a
total of 4 errors, so total accuracy was 99.8%. Participants were able to
perform with near-perfect accuracy regardless of ballot length, ballot type,

was extremely robust. We conclude that with proper direction and resources,
voters can be near-perfect detectors of ballot changes on printed paper ballots

Analytical models that were trained and tested pre-pandemic may no longer be
performing up to expectations, providing unreliable and irrelevant learning
(ML) models given that ML depends on the basic principle that what happened in
the past are likely to repeat in the future. ML faced to two important
degradation principles, concept drift, when the underlying properties and
characteristics of the variables change and data drift, when the data
distributions, probabilities, co-variates, and other variable relationships
change, both of which are prime culprits of model failure. Therefore, detecting

imperative. And perhaps even more important is a shift in our mindset towards a

Impact of Change Granularity in Refactoring Detection,2022-04-24T13:47:52Z,"Lei Chen, Shinpei Hayashi","Detecting refactorings in commit history is essential to improve the
comprehension of code changes in code reviews and to provide valuable
information for empirical studies on software evolution. Several techniques
have been proposed to detect refactorings accurately at the granularity level
of a single commit. However, refactorings may be performed over multiple
commits because of code complexity or other real development problems, which is
why attempting to detect refactorings at single-commit granularity is
insufficient. We observe that some refactorings can be detected only at coarser
granularity, that is, changes spread across multiple commits. Herein, this type
of refactoring is referred to as coarse-grained refactoring (CGR). We compared
the refactorings detected on different granularities of commits from 19
open-source repositories. The results show that CGRs are common, and their
frequency increases as the granularity becomes coarser. In addition, we found
that Move-related refactorings tended to be the most frequent CGRs. We also
analyzed the causes of CGR and suggested that CGRs will be valuable in
refactoring research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11276v1

change of dispersion. These changes are crucial in understanding the CDW phase,
as they provide a measure of the Se$_{4p}$-Ti$_{3d}$ hybridization strength and

visualize the parabolically-shaped Ti$_{3d}$ conduction band. Furthermore, we
observe a transient change of effective mass in the Se$_{4p}$ valence band
following photoexcitation. This occurs alongside an overall reduction due to
weakening of the CDW phase and is accompanied by an oscillating component with
the frequency of the characteristic A$_{1g}$ phonon. These observations,

The Price and Cost of Bitcoin,2022-04-27T17:57:55Z,"John E. Marthinsen, Steven R. Gordon","Explaining changes in bitcoin's price and predicting its future have been the
foci of many research studies. In contrast, far less attention has been paid to
the relationship between bitcoin's mining costs and its price. One popular
notion is the cost of bitcoin creation provides a support level below which
this cryptocurrency's price should never fall because if it did, mining would
become unprofitable and threaten the maintenance of bitcoin's public ledger.
Other research has used mining costs to explain or forecast bitcoin's price
movements. Competing econometric analyses have debunked this idea, showing that
changes in mining costs follow changes in bitcoin's price rather than preceding
them, but the reason for this behavior remains unexplained in these analyses.
This research aims to employ economic theory to explain why econometric studies

  polymers",2022-04-28T12:34:07Z,"M. Muto, Y. Tagawa","The viscoelastic behavior of liquid polymers changes depending on the
microstructure of the polymer chains. To investigate the unsteady structural
changes induced by polymer chain morphology under stress, we develop a simple
rheo-optical technique combining a high-speed polarization camera and
dripping-onto-substrate capillary breakup extensional rheometry (CaBER-DoS),
which uniaxially extends and aligns the polymer along the stress direction.
Using this technique, the viscoelastic behavior and birefringence field of an
extending liquid polymer are simultaneously measured. Unlike the conditions
that occur under shear-stress loading with a rotational rheometer, this
technique provides a linear relation between birefringence and extensional
stress. The measurements reflect the structural change in a flexible polymer (a
mixed solution of PEO and CNCs) in the temporal evolution of the birefringence
and orientation angle, which is a measure of the orientation state and
coil-stretch transition of a polymer chain. Remarkably, within the
elasto-capillary regime, the measured birefringence remains constant with a
constant orientation state, while the Weissenberg number gradually increases,
which provides experimental evidence of the coil-stretch transition of the

Volatility Sensitive Bayesian Estimation of Portfolio VaR and CVaR,2022-05-03T12:07:55Z,"Taras Bodnar, Vilhelm Niklasson, Erik Thorsén","In this paper, a new way to integrate volatility information for estimating

statistics and it is based on the idea of volatility clustering. By specifying
the hyperparameters in a conjugate prior based on two different rolling window
sizes, it is possible to quickly adapt to changes in volatility and
automatically specify the degree of certainty in the prior. This constitutes an
advantage in comparison to existing Bayesian methods that are less sensitive to
such changes in volatilities and also usually lack standardized ways of
expressing the degree of belief. We illustrate our new approach using both

predicting its own future activity. That assumption leads to a neuronal
learning rule that uses presynaptic input to modulate prediction error. We
argue that an analogous RL rule would use action probability to modulate reward
prediction error. This modulation makes the agent more sensitive to negative
experiences, and more careful in forming preferences. We embed the proposed
rule in both tabular and deep-Q-network RL algorithms, and find that it

"Robust multiscale estimation of time-average variance for time series
  segmentation",2022-05-23T17:52:27Z,"Euan T. McGonigle, Haeran Cho","There exist several methods developed for the canonical change point problem
of detecting multiple mean shifts, which search for changes over sections of
the data at multiple scales. In such methods, estimation of the noise level is
often required in order to distinguish genuine changes from random fluctuations
due to the noise. When serial dependence is present, using a single estimator
of the noise level may not be appropriate. Instead, it is proposed to adopt a
scale-dependent time-average variance constant that depends on the length of
the data section in consideration, to gauge the level of the noise therein.
Accordingly, an estimator that is robust to the presence of multiple mean
shifts is developed. The consistency of the proposed estimator is shown under
general assumptions permitting heavy-tailedness, and its use with two widely
adopted data segmentation algorithms, the moving sum and the wild binary
segmentation procedures, is discussed. The performance of the proposed
estimator is illustrated through extensive simulation studies and on
applications to the house price index and air quality data sets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11496v2
The Effect of Increased Access to IVF on Women's Careers,2022-05-21T23:25:04Z,Lingxi Chen,"Motherhood is the main contributor to gender gaps in the labor market. IVF is
a method of assisted reproduction that can delay fertility, which results in
decreased motherhood income penalty. In this research, I estimate the effects
of expanded access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) arising from state insurance
mandates. I use a difference-in-differences model to estimate the effect of
increased IVF accessibility for delaying childbirth and decreasing the
motherhood income penalty. Using the fertility supplement dataset from the
Current Population Survey (CPS), I estimate how outcomes change in states when
they implement their mandates compared to how outcomes change in states that
are not changing their policies. The results indicate that IVF mandates
increase the probability of motherhood by 38 by 3.1 percentage points (p<0.01).

  Propensities",2022-06-06T10:08:58Z,"Vishwa Vinay, Manoj Kilaru, David Arbour","Search engines and recommendation systems attempt to continually improve the
quality of the experience they afford to their users. Refining the ranker that
produces the lists displayed in response to user requests is an important
component of this process. A common practice is for the service providers to
make changes (e.g. new ranking features, different ranking models) and A/B test
them on a fraction of their users to establish the value of the change. An
alternative approach estimates the effectiveness of the proposed changes
offline, utilising previously collected clickthrough data on the old ranker to
posit what the user behaviour on ranked lists produced by the new ranker would
have been. A majority of offline evaluation approaches invoke the well studied
inverse propensity weighting to adjust for biases inherent in logged data. In
this paper, we propose the use of parametric estimates for these propensities.

we show how accurate offline evaluation can be achieved when the new rankings

Robust Inference for Change Points in High Dimension,2022-06-06T16:52:35Z,"Feiyu Jiang, Runmin Wang, Xiaofeng Shao","This paper proposes a new test for a change point in the mean of
high-dimensional data based on the spatial sign and self-normalization. The
test is easy to implement with no tuning parameters, robust to heavy-tailedness
and theoretically justified with both fixed-$n$ and sequential asymptotics
under both null and alternatives, where $n$ is the sample size. We demonstrate
that the fixed-$n$ asymptotics provide a better approximation to the finite
sample distribution and thus should be preferred in both testing and
testing-based estimation. To estimate the number and locations when multiple
change-points are present, we propose to combine the p-value under the
fixed-$n$ asymptotics with the seeded binary segmentation (SBS) algorithm.
Through numerical experiments, we show that the spatial sign based procedures
are robust with respect to the heavy-tailedness and strong coordinate-wise
dependence, whereas their non-robust counterparts proposed in Wang et al.

illustrate the robustness and broad applicability of the proposed test and its

Is Self-Supervised Learning More Robust Than Supervised Learning?,2022-06-10T17:58:00Z,"Yuanyi Zhong, Haoran Tang, Junkun Chen, Jian Peng, Yu-Xiong Wang","Self-supervised contrastive learning is a powerful tool to learn visual
representation without labels. Prior work has primarily focused on evaluating
the recognition accuracy of various pre-training algorithms, but has overlooked
other behavioral aspects. In addition to accuracy, distributional robustness
plays a critical role in the reliability of machine learning models. We design
and conduct a series of robustness tests to quantify the behavioral differences
between contrastive learning and supervised learning to downstream or
pre-training data distribution changes. These tests leverage data corruptions
at multiple levels, ranging from pixel-level gamma distortion to patch-level
shuffling and to dataset-level distribution shift. Our tests unveil intriguing
robustness behaviors of contrastive and supervised learning. On the one hand,
under downstream corruptions, we generally observe that contrastive learning is
surprisingly more robust than supervised learning. On the other hand, under
pre-training corruptions, we find contrastive learning vulnerable to patch

Modeling of High and Low Resistant States in Single Defect Atomristors,2022-06-11T11:15:16Z,"Yuvraj Misra, Tarun Kumar Agarwal","Resistance-change random access memory (RRAM) devices are nanoscale
metal-insulator-metal structures that can store information in their resistance
states, namely the high resistance (HRS) and low resistance (LRS) states. They
are a potential candidate for a universal memory as these non-volatile memory
elements can offer fast-switching, long retention and switching cycles, and
additionally, are also suitable for direct applications in neuromorphic
computing. In this study, we first present a model to analyze different
resistance states of RRAM devices or so-called ""atomristors"" that utilize novel
2D materials as the switching materials instead of insulators. The developed
model is then used to study the electrical characteristics of a single defect
monolayer MoS$_{2}$ memristor. The change in the device resistance between the
HRS and LRS is associated to the change in the tunneling probability when the
vacancy defects in the 2D material are substituted by the metal atoms from the
electrodes. The distortion due to defects and substituted metal atom is
captured in the 1D potential energy profile by averaging the effect along the
transverse direction. This simplification enables us to model single defect

one-dimensional one-band models with arbitrary boundary conditions. We use this
method on several systems to find analytical expressions for the eigenvalues,
which give us conditions on the parameter values in the system for when we can
expect the spectrum to be insensitive to a change in boundary conditions. By
stacking one-dimensional chains, we use the derived results to find
corresponding conditions for insensitivity for some two-dimensional systems
with periodic boundary conditions in one direction. This would be hard by using
other methods to detect skin effect, such as the winding of the determinant of

open boundary conditions in both directions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08976v2

Manipulation of Nuclear Isomers with Lasers: Mechanisms and Prospects,2022-06-25T19:40:39Z,"Zhiguo Ma, Changbo Fu, Wanbing He, Yugang Ma","Over one hundred years have passed since the nuclear isomer was first
introduced, in analogy with chemical isomers to describe long-lived excited
nuclear states. In 1921, Otto Hahn discovered the first nuclear isomer
$^{234m}$Pa. After that, step by step, it was realized that different types of
nuclear isomers exist, including spin isomer, K isomer, seniority isomers, and
``shape and fission'' isomer. The spin isomer occurs when the spin change
$\Delta I$ of a transition is very large. The larger $\Delta I$, the lower the
electromagnetic transition rates, the longer the half-lives. The K-isomer
exists due to the significant change in K, where K is the projection of the
total angular momentum on the symmetry axis. The seniority isomers arise due to
a very small transition probability in seniority conserving transitions around
semi-magic nuclei, where the seniority, which corresponds to the number of
unpaired nucleons, is a reasonably pure quantum number. For a so-called shape
isomer, the inhibition of the decay transition comes from the associated shape
changes. It is caused by that a nucleus is trapped in a deformed shape which is
its secondary minimum and is hard to decay back to its ground state.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12723v1

electrical current and conductance. As such, it reproduces a realistically

change in the early layers, which are mostly convolutional, is beneficial,

Quantum phase transition between hyperuniform density distributions,2022-07-20T06:59:27Z,"Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita, Tomi Ohtsuki","We study an electron distribution under a quasiperiodic potential in light of
hyperuniformity, aiming to establish a classification and analysis method for
aperiodic but orderly density distributions realized in, e.g., quasicrystals.
Using the Aubry-Andre-Harper model, we first reveal that the electron-charge
distribution changes its character as the increased quasiperiodic potential
alters the eigenstates from extended to localized ones. While these changes of
the charge distribution are characterized by neither multifractality nor
translational-symmetry breaking, they are characterized by hyperuniformity
class and its order metric. We find a nontrivial relationship between the
density of states at the Fermi level, a charge-distribution histogram, and the
hyperuniformity class. The change to a different hyperuniformity class occurs
as a first-order phase transition except for an electron-hole symmetric point,
where the transition is of the third order. Moreover, we generalize the
hyperuniformity order metric to a function, to capture more detailed features
of the density distribution, in some analogy with a generalization of the
fractal dimension to a multifractal one.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09698v1

an increase in the availability of biosignals. To analyze these continuously
recorded, and often multidimensional, time series at scale, being able to
conduct meaningful unsupervised data segmentation is an auspicious target. A
common way to achieve this is to identify change-points within the time series

algorithms often come with drawbacks, limiting their real-world applicability.
Notably, they generally rely on the complete time series to be available and
thus cannot be used for real-time applications. Another common limitation is
that they poorly (or cannot) handle the segmentation of multidimensional time

concurrently under changing conditions. Instead, the analysis showed that the
systems coherence, while changing continuously with entanglement strength on
the global scale, remains zero on the local level. This effect, common for bi

brightness changes for each pixel. Due to their high dynamic range, pixel
bandwidth, temporal resolution, low power consumption, and computational
simplicity, they are beneficial for vision-based projects in challenging

response time. The first generation of ECs are monochrome, but color data is
very useful and sometimes essential for certain vision-based applications. The
latest technology enables manufacturers to build color ECs, trading off the
size of the sensor and substantially reducing the resolution compared to
monochrome models, despite having the same bandwidth. In addition, ECs only
detect changes in light and do not show static or slowly moving objects. We
introduce a method to detect full RGB events using a monochrome EC aided by a
structured light projector. The projector emits rapidly changing RGB patterns
of light beams on the scene, the reflection of which is captured by the EC. We

Learning Efficient Abstract Planning Models that Choose What to Predict,2022-08-16T13:12:59Z,"Nishanth Kumar, Willie McClinton, Rohan Chitnis, Tom Silver, Tomás Lozano-Pérez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling","An effective approach to solving long-horizon tasks in robotics domains with

learning abstract models in the form of symbolic operators and neural samplers.
In this work, we show that existing symbolic operator learning approaches fall
short in many robotics domains where a robot's actions tend to cause a large
number of irrelevant changes in the abstract state. This is primarily because
they attempt to learn operators that exactly predict all observed changes in
the abstract state. To overcome this issue, we propose to learn operators that
'choose what to predict' by only modelling changes necessary for abstract
planning to achieve specified goals. Experimentally, we show that our approach

Subdiffusive semantic evolution in Indo-European languages,2022-09-10T15:57:32Z,"Bogdán Asztalos, Gergely Palla, Dániel Czégel","How do words change their meaning? Although semantic evolution is driven by a
variety of distinct factors, including linguistic, societal, and technological
ones, we find that there is one law that holds universally across five major
Indo-European languages: that semantic evolution is strongly subdiffusive.
Using an automated pipeline of diachronic distributional semantic embedding
that controls for underlying symmetries, we show that words follow stochastic
trajectories in meaning space with an anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha=
0.45\pm 0.05$ across languages, in contrast with diffusing particles that
follow $\alpha=1$. Randomization methods indicate that preserving temporal
correlations in semantic change directions is necessary to recover strongly
subdiffusive behavior; however, correlations in change sizes play an important
role too. We furthermore show that strong subdiffusion is a robust phenomenon
under a wide variety of choices in data analysis and interpretation, such as
the choice of fitting an ensemble average of displacements or averaging
best-fit exponents of individual word trajectories.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04701v1

actual temperature change can be measured by a single measurement in the
frequency domain even when the electrocaloric effect shows nonlinear response
to the excitation field. We have demonstrated the method by measuring the
temperature dependence of the electric-field-induced temperature change for two
Sr-doped BaTiO$_3$ systems with different ferroelectric-paraelectric phase
transition temperatures, where the procedure for extracting the pure
electrocaloric contribution free from heat losses and Joule heating due to

"Spectral Phase Effects in High-Order Above Threshold Ionization of Noble
  Gas Atoms",2022-09-14T16:22:24Z,A. L. Harris,"We present theoretical studies of above threshold ionization (ATI) using
sculpted laser pulses for noble gas atoms. The time-dependent Schroedinger
equation is solved to calculate the ATI energy and momentum spectra, and a
qualitative understanding of the electron motion after ionization is explored
using a classical model that solves Newton's equation of motion. Results are
presented for Gaussian and Airy laser pulses with identical power spectra, but
differing spectral phases. The simulations show that the third order spectral
phase of the Airy pulse, which can alter the temporal envelope of the electric
field, causes changes to the timing of ionization and the dynamics of the
rescattering process. Specifically, the use of Airy pulses in the ATI process
results in a shift of the Keldysh plateau cutoff to lower energy due to a
decreased pondermotive energy of the electron in the laser field. Additionally,
the side lobes of the Airy laser pulse change the number and timing of
rescattering events, which results in changes to the high-order ATI plateau.
Our results also show that laser pulses with identical carrier envelope phases
and nearly identical envelopes yield different photoelectron momentum
densities, which are a direct result of the pulse's spectral phase.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06759v2

interesting to check whether are there clues to support a TDE in NGC 1097, not
only a changing-look AGN but also an AGN with double-peaked broad emission

to a TDE, the 13years-long (1991-2004) variability of double-peaked broad

The Role of Solar Soft X-rays Irradiance in Thermospheric Structure,2022-09-20T22:25:34Z,"Srimoyee Samaddar, Karthik Venkataramani, Scott. M. Bailey","We use a new Atmospheric Chemistry and Energetics one-dimensional (ACE1D)
thermospheric model to show that the energies deposited by the solar soft
x-rays in the lower thermosphere at altitudes between 100 -150 km (Bailey et

altitudes well above 300 km. By turning off the input solar flux in the
different wavelength bins of the model iteratively, we are able to demonstrate
that the maximum change in exospheric temperature is due to the changes in the
soft x-ray solar bins. We also show, using the thermodynamic heat equation,
that the molecular diffusion via non-thermal photoelectrons, is the main source
of heat transfer to the upper ionosphere/thermosphere and results in the
increase of the temperature of the neutral atmosphere. Moreover, these
temperature change and heating effects of the solar soft x-rays are comparable
to that of the strong HeII 30.4nm emission. Lastly, we show that the

Learning State-Aware Visual Representations from Audible Interactions,2022-09-27T17:57:13Z,"Himangi Mittal, Pedro Morgado, Unnat Jain, Abhinav Gupta","We propose a self-supervised algorithm to learn representations from
egocentric video data. Recently, significant efforts have been made to capture
humans interacting with their own environments as they go about their daily

can be challenging. First, given the uncurated nature of long-form continuous
videos, learning effective representations require focusing on moments in time
when interactions take place. Second, visual representations of daily
activities should be sensitive to changes in the state of the environment.
However, current successful multi-modal learning frameworks encourage
representation invariance over time. To address these challenges, we leverage
audio signals to identify moments of likely interactions which are conducive to
better learning. We also propose a novel self-supervised objective that learns

Judgment of paradigms for magnetic reconnection in coronal loops,2022-09-14T13:50:56Z,Allen H Boozer,"The traditional paradigm for magnetic field lines changing connections
ignores magnetic field line chaos and requires an extremely large current
density, $j_{max}\propto R_m$, flowing in thin sheets of thickness $1/R_m$,
where $R_m$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. The time required for a general
natural evolution to take a smooth magnetic field into such a state is rarely
considered. Natural evolutions generally cause magnetic field lines to become
chaotic. A fast change in field line connections then arises on the timescale
defined by the evolution multiplied by a $\ln(R_m)$ factor, and the required
maximum current density scales as $\ln(R_m)$. Even when simulations support the
new paradigm based on chaos, they have been interpreted as supporting the old.
How this could happen is an important example for plasma physics of Kuhn's

little power and can capture a wider dynamic range with no motion blur and
higher temporal resolution than conventional frame-based cameras. Although this

simple and effective approach to adapting neural models in response to changing
settings. We first train a standard network using dropout, which is analogous
to learning an ensemble of predictive models or distribution over predictions.
At run-time, we use a particle filter to maintain a distribution over dropout
masks to adapt the neural model to changing settings in an online manner.
Experimental results show improved performance in control problems requiring
both online and look-ahead prediction, and showcase the interpretability of the
inferred masks in a human behaviour modelling task for drone teleoperation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15779v1
Forcing More DC Over the Chang Model Using the Thorn Sequence,2022-10-28T18:56:19Z,"James Holland, Grigor Sargsyan","In the context of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{DC}$, we force $\mathsf{DC}_\kappa$
for relations on $\mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ for $\kappa{}<\aleph_\omega$ over the
Chang model $\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{Ord}^\omega)$ making some assumptions on the
thorn sequence defined by ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_0=\omega$, ${\it
\unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha{}+1}$ as the least ordinal not a surjective image of
${\it \unicode{xFE}}_\alpha^\omega$ (i.e. no $f:{\it
\unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha}^\omega{}\rightarrow {\it \unicode{xFE}}_{\alpha{}+1}$
is surjective) and ${\it \unicode{xFE}}_\gamma{}=\sup_{\alpha{}<\gamma}{\it
\unicode{xFE}}_\alpha$ for limit $\gamma$. These assumptions are motivated from
results about $\Theta$ in the context of determinacy, and could be reasonable
ways of thinking about the Chang model. Explicitly, we assume cardinals
$\lambda$ on the thorn sequence are strongly regular (meaning regular and
functions $f:\kappa{}^{<\kappa}\rightarrow \lambda$ are bounded whenever
$\kappa{}<\lambda$ is on the thorn sequence) and justified (meaning
$\mathcal{P}(\kappa^\omega)\cap \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{Ord}^\omega)\subseteq
\mathrm{L}_{\lambda}(\lambda^\omega{},X)$ for some $X\subseteq \lambda$ for any
$\kappa{}<\lambda$ on the thorn sequence). This allow us to use Cohen forcing

"BCI-Walls: A robust methodology to predict success or failure in brain
  computer interfaces",2022-10-30T20:27:10Z,"Bernd Porr, Lucía Muñoz Bohollo","Brain computer interfaces (BCI) depend on reliable realtime detection of
conscious EEG changes for example to control a video game. However, scalp
recordings are contaminated with non-stationary noise, such as facial muscle
activity and eye movements. This interferes with the detection process making
it potentially unreliable or even impossible. We have developed a new
methodology which provides a hard and measurable criterion if conscious EEG
changes can be detected in the presence of non-stationary noise by requiring
the signal-to-noise ratio of a scalp recording to be greater than the SNR-wall
which in turn is based on the highest and lowest noise variances of the
recording. As an instructional example, we have recorded signals from the
central electrode Cz during eight different activities causing non-stationary
noise such as playing a video game or reading out loud. The results show that
facial muscle activity and eye-movements have a strong impact on the
detectability of EEG and that minimising both eye-movement artefacts and muscle
noise is essential to be able to detect conscious EEG changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16939v3

problems to integrate physical measurement models and learned image priors.
Plug-and-play priors (PnP) and deep equilibrium models (DEQ) are two DMBA
frameworks that have received significant attention. The key difference between
the two is that the image prior in DEQ is trained by using a specific
measurement model, while that in PnP is trained as a general image denoiser.
This difference is behind a common assumption that PnP is more robust to
changes in the measurement models compared to DEQ. This paper investigates the
robustness of DEQ priors to changes in the measurement models. Our results on

Concrete Score Matching: Generalized Score Matching for Discrete Data,2022-11-02T00:41:37Z,"Chenlin Meng, Kristy Choi, Jiaming Song, Stefano Ermon","Representing probability distributions by the gradient of their density
functions has proven effective in modeling a wide range of continuous data
modalities. However, this representation is not applicable in discrete domains
where the gradient is undefined. To this end, we propose an analogous score
function called the ""Concrete score"", a generalization of the (Stein) score for
discrete settings. Given a predefined neighborhood structure, the Concrete
score of any input is defined by the rate of change of the probabilities with
respect to local directional changes of the input. This formulation allows us
to recover the (Stein) score in continuous domains when measuring such changes
by the Euclidean distance, while using the Manhattan distance leads to our
novel score function in discrete domains. Finally, we introduce a new framework
to learn such scores from samples called Concrete Score Matching (CSM), and
propose an efficient training objective to scale our approach to high
dimensions. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of CSM on density
estimation tasks on a mixture of synthetic, tabular, and high-dimensional image
datasets, and demonstrate that it performs favorably relative to existing
baselines for modeling discrete data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00802v2

Local Manifold Augmentation for Multiview Semantic Consistency,2022-11-05T02:00:13Z,"Yu Yang, Wing Yin Cheung, Chang Liu, Xiangyang Ji","Multiview self-supervised representation learning roots in exploring semantic
consistency across data of complex intra-class variation. Such variation is not
directly accessible and therefore simulated by data augmentations. However,
commonly adopted augmentations are handcrafted and limited to simple
geometrical and color changes, which are unable to cover the abundant
intra-class variation. In this paper, we propose to extract the underlying data
variation from datasets and construct a novel augmentation operator, named
local manifold augmentation (LMA). LMA is achieved by training an
instance-conditioned generator to fit the distribution on the local manifold of
data and sampling multiview data using it. LMA shows the ability to create an
infinite number of data views, preserve semantics, and simulate complicated
variations in object pose, viewpoint, lighting condition, background etc.
Experiments show that with LMA integrated, self-supervised learning methods
such as MoCov2 and SimSiam gain consistent improvement on prevalent benchmarks
including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, ImageNet100, and ImageNet. Furthermore, LMA
leads to representations that obtain more significant invariance to the

positions from N candidates where K < N. Most existing methods assume that
sensor positions are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile
sensors like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time.
Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed, which are
difficult to cover with statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by
allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the
network. We dynamically determine the sensor positions based on graph signal
sampling theory such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best
recovered from the observations. For signal recovery, the dictionary is learned
from a pool of observed signals. It is also used for the sensor position
selection. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method
via the mean squared error of the reconstructed signals. The proposed dynamic
sensor placement outperforms the existing static ones for both synthetic and
real data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04019v4

demonstrate that single cells of a human neuronal cell line, display all

denaturation. Triggered by temperature and modified by pH here, a thermodynamic

metaphorical language change qualifies as a self-organized criticality state
and the linguistic expressions of a metaphor can be profiled as a fractal with
spatio-temporal correlations. Synchronously, these metaphorical expressions
self-organize into a self-similar, scale-invariant fractal that follows a

changes nonlinearly with the tension induced by the pressure from the
surrounding gas. Although the dynamics of pressurized 2D material membranes
have been extensively explored, recent experimental observations show
significant deviations from analytical predictions. Here, we present a
multi-mode continuum approach to capture the nonlinear pressure-frequency
response of pre-tensioned membranes undergoing large deflections. We validate
the model using experiments conducted on polysilicon drums excited
opto-thermally and subjected to pressure changes in the surrounding medium. We
demonstrate that considering the effect of pressure on the membrane tension is
not sufficient for determining the resonance frequencies. In fact, it is
essential to also account for the change in the membrane's shape in the
pressurized configuration, the mid-plane stretching, and the contributions of
higher modes to the mode shapes. Finally, we show how the presented
high-frequency mechanical characterization method can be used to determine

photometric bands increased up to $\approx$0.6 in the optical bands and up to
$\approx$1.1 magnitudes in the UV bands. The brightening was accompanied by a
blueward shift of the optical spectrum. AT2021fxu shows high X-ray (0.3-10 keV)

Counterfactual Explanations for Support Vector Machine Models,2022-12-14T17:13:22Z,"Sebastian Salazar, Samuel Denton, Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi","We tackle the problem of computing counterfactual explanations -- minimal
changes to the features that flip an undesirable model prediction. We propose a
solution to this question for linear Support Vector Machine (SVMs) models.
Moreover, we introduce a way to account for weighted actions that allow for
more changes in certain features than others. In particular, we show how to
find counterfactual explanations with the purpose of increasing model
interpretability. These explanations are valid, change only actionable
features, are close to the data distribution, sparse, and take into account
correlations between features. We cast this as a mixed integer programming
optimization problem. Additionally, we introduce two novel scale-invariant cost
functions for assessing the quality of counterfactual explanations and use them
to evaluate the quality of our approach with a real medical dataset. Finally,
we build a support vector machine model to predict whether law students will
pass the Bar exam using protected features, and used our algorithms to uncover
the inherent biases of the SVM.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07432v1

been intensively studied in epitaxial systems, including ferroelectric domain
walls and interfaces in superlattices. Here, we investigate the relation
between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in
polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and different
scanning probe microscopy techniques, we demonstrate that the polycrystalline
material develops charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic
conductance. By performing atom probe tomography measurements, we find an
enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries. The
observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible
polarization-driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather

Learning to repeatedly solve routing problems,2022-12-15T19:33:54Z,"Mouad Morabit, Guy Desaulniers, Andrea Lodi","In the last years, there has been a great interest in machine-learning-based
heuristics for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The

a minor change in its data. We focus on the case of the capacited vehicle
routing problem with static clients (i.e., same client locations) and changed
demands. Given the edges of an original solution, the goal is to predict and
fix the ones that have a high chance of remaining in an optimal solution after
a change of client demands. This partial prediction of the solution reduces the

Data Curation Alone Can Stabilize In-context Learning,2022-12-20T15:58:54Z,"Ting-Yun Chang, Robin Jia","In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks by prompting them with a sequence of training examples. However, it is
known that ICL is very sensitive to the choice of training examples: randomly
sampling examples from a training set leads to high variance in performance. In
this paper, we show that carefully curating a subset of training data greatly
stabilizes ICL performance without any other changes to the ICL algorithm
(e.g., prompt retrieval or calibration). We introduce two methods to choose
training subsets -- both score training examples individually, then select the
highest-scoring ones. CondAcc scores a training example by its average dev-set
ICL accuracy when combined with random training examples, while Datamodels
learns linear regressors that estimate how the presence of each training
example influences LLM outputs. Across five tasks and two LLMs, sampling from
stable subsets selected by CondAcc and Datamodels improves average accuracy
over sampling from the entire training set by 7.7% and 6.3%, respectively.
Surprisingly, the stable subset examples are not especially diverse in content

Considering the emerging trend in software engineering in techniques based on
the analysis of codebases' evolution, we compare a representation based on the
monolith code structure, in particular the sequences of accesses to domain

changes and changes authorship). From the analysis on a total of 468k
decompositions of 28 codebases, using five quality metrics that evaluate
modularity, minimization of the number of transactions per functionality, and
reduction of teams and communication, we conclude that the best decompositions
on each metric were made by combining data from the sequences of accesses and

significantly correlates with player engagement, determining game experience.
Unlike a typical recommendation system that depends on item-user interactions,
in our setting, user-user interactions do not depend on each other. Meanwhile,
user preferences change rapidly due to fast changing game environment. There

The Sticky Lévy Process as a solution to a Time Change Equation,2022-12-30T22:00:58Z,"Miriam Ramírez, Gerónimo Uribe Bravo","Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) were originally devised by It\^o to
provide a pathwise construction of diffusion processes. A less explored
approach to represent them is through Time Change Equations (TCEs) as put forth
by Doeblin. TCEs are a generalization of Ordinary Differential Equations driven
by random functions. We present a simple example where TCEs have some advantage
over SDEs.
  We represent sticky L\'evy processes as the unique solution to a TCE driven
by a L\'evy process with no negative jumps. The solution is adapted to the
time-changed filtration of the L\'evy process driving the equation. This is in
contrast to the SDE describing sticky Brownian motion, which is known to have
no adapted solutions as first proved by Chitashvili. A known consequence of
such non-adaptability for SDEs is that certain natural approximations to the
solution of the corresponding SDE do not converge in probability, even though
they do converge weakly. Instead, we provide strong approximation schemes for
the solution of our TCE (by adapting Euler's method for ODEs), whenever the
driving L\'evy process is strongly approximated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00063v2

unique ability display a reversible change in their phase upon stimulation by
optical pulses i.e., amorphous (a-GST) to crystalline (c-GST) and vice-versa.
The two phases exhibit remarkably different electrical and optical properties
like conductivity, reflectivity, refractive index and optical loss, this
coupled with their high phase switching speeds, low power phase switching,
large measurable optical and electrical contrast, and phase stability makes GST
alloys stand out from other phase change materials (PCM). GST alloys have
already found extensive use in optical disks and electronic memories due to
their non-volatility and zero static power consumption, but the precise
mechanism of the phase change is not clearly understood. The phase change
mechanism has usually been attributed to the optical pulse, usually a high
power short pulse laser, heating up the c-GST alloy to above its melting
temperature (Tm) after which, if it is cooled rapidly enough to below the glass
transition temperature (Tg), the atoms are fixed in place due to the drastic
reduction in their mobility, resulting in a phase which exhibits structure
similar to a frozen liquid and lacks long range order i.e. amorphous. When
heated above Tg with an intermediate power laser pulse for a significant amount
of time, then this favors the shift back to the energetically favorable
crystalline phase. With the growing interest in next generation data storage
technology for photonic and neuromorphic computing, the research into
understanding and improving the properties of GST alloys has also been
rekindled. In this term paper we hope to investigate and gain a deeper
understanding and appreciation of the kinetics and underlying atomistic
mechanism of this phase transition from c-GST to a-GST and vice-versa which is

a popular tool for understanding the growth of galaxies and its connection with
the quenching of star formation. The emerging picture suggests that building a
central dense core is a necessary condition for quenching. However, it is not
clear whether changes in $\Sigma_{1}$ trace changes in stellar kinematics and
the growth of dispersion-dominated bulges. In this paper, we combine imaging
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with stellar kinematics from the Sydney-AAO
Multi-object Integral-field unit (SAMI) and Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache
Point Observatory (MaNGA) surveys to quantify the correlation between
$\Sigma_{1}$ and the proxy for stellar spin parameter within one effective
radius ($\lambda_{re}$) for 1599 nearby galaxies. We show that, on the
star-forming main sequence and at fixed stellar mass, changes in $\Sigma_{1}$
are mirrored by changes in $\lambda_{re}$. While forming stars, main sequence
galaxies remain rotationally-dominated systems, with their $\Sigma_{1}$
increasing but their stellar spin staying either constant or slightly
increasing. The picture changes below the main sequence, where $\Sigma_{1}$ and
$\lambda_{re}$ are no longer correlated. Passive systems show a narrower range
of $\Sigma_{1}$, but a wider range of $\lambda_{re}$ compared to star-forming
galaxies. Our results indicate that, from a structural point of view, passive
galaxies are a more heterogeneous population than star-forming systems, and may
have followed a variety of evolutionary paths. This also suggests that, if
dispersion-dominated bulges still grow significantly at $z\sim$0, this
generally takes place during, or after, the quenching phase.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04815v1

cycles. In this study, we use a three-dimensional (3-D) model to simulate
conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by
varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on
heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper
atmosphere (<40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact
of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance
shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving
significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at <
10$^{-5}$ mbar. More specifically, CO$_{2}$ 15-${\mu}$m cooling balances EUV/UV
and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10$^{-7}$ mbar pressure with
a strong maximum balance for pressures at ~10$^{-5}$ mbar, thus explaining the
invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10$^{-5}$mbar

Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments,2022-05-20T15:29:38Z,"Chen Zhao, Feng Mi, Xintao Wu, Kai Jiang, Latifur Khan, Feng Chen","The fairness-aware online learning framework has arisen as a powerful tool
for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to
sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and
the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across
different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of
existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data
and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static
regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are
sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online
learning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a
novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a
strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter
at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning
algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in
both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of
a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and
dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness,
respectively. The theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both

Do Customized Android Frameworks Keep Pace with Android?,2022-05-31T04:45:59Z,"Pei Liu, Mattia Fazzini, John Grundy, Li Li","To satisfy varying customer needs, device vendors and OS providers often rely

vendors and OS providers need to merge the changes from the Android OS into
their customizations to account for its bug fixes, security patches, and new
features. Because developers of customized OSs might have made changes to code
locations that were also modified by the developers of the Android OS, the
merge task can be characterized by conflicts, which can be time-consuming and
error-prone to resolve.
  To provide more insight into this critical aspect of the Android ecosystem,
we present an empirical study that investigates how eight open-source
customizations of the Android OS merge the changes from the Android OS into
their projects. The study analyzes how often the developers from the customized
OSs merge changes from the Android OS, how often the developers experience
textual merge conflicts, and the characteristics of these conflicts.
Furthermore, to analyze the effect of the conflicts, the study also analyzes
how the conflicts can affect a randomly selected sample of 1,000 apps. After
analyzing 1,148 merge operations, we identified that developers perform these
operations for 9.7\% of the released versions of the Android OS, developers
will encounter at least one conflict in 41.3\% of the merge operations, 58.1\%
of the conflicts required developers to change the customized OSs, and 64.4\%

predict the behavior of surrounding road users. Most of the machine-learned

square error (RMSE) to learn and report their models' capabilities. This focus
on quantitative error metrics tends to ignore the more important behavioral
aspect of the models, raising the question of whether these models really
predict human-like behavior. Thus, we propose to analyze the output of
machine-learned models much like we would analyze human data in conventional
behavioral research. We introduce quantitative metrics to demonstrate presence
of three different behavioral phenomena in a naturalistic highway driving
dataset: 1) The kinematics-dependence of who passes a merging point first 2)
Lane change by an on-highway vehicle to accommodate an on-ramp vehicle 3) Lane
changes by vehicles on the highway to avoid lead vehicle conflicts. Then, we
analyze the behavior of three machine-learned models using the same metrics.
Even though the models' RMSE value differed, all the models captured the
kinematic-dependent merging behavior but struggled at varying degrees to
capture the more nuanced courtesy lane change and highway lane change behavior.
Additionally, the collision aversion analysis during lane changes showed that
the models struggled to capture the physical aspect of human driving: leaving
adequate gap between the vehicles. Thus, our analysis highlighted the
inadequacy of simple quantitative metrics and the need to take a broader
behavioral perspective when analyzing machine-learned models of human driving

Characterizing Python Library Migrations,2022-07-03T21:00:08Z,"Mohayeminul Islam, Ajay Kumar Jha, Ildar Akhmetov, Sarah Nadi","Developers heavily rely on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) from

replace the used libraries with alternate libraries, a process known as library
migration. Doing this manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and prone to

However, designing effective automated migration techniques requires
understanding the types of code changes required to transform client code that
used the old library to the new library. This paper contributes an empirical
study that provides a holistic view of Python library migrations, both in terms
of the code changes required in a migration and the typical development effort
involved. We manually label 3,096 migration-related code changes in 335 Python
library migrations from 311 client repositories spanning 141 library pairs from
35 domains. Based on our labeled data, we derive a taxonomy for describing
migration-related code changes, PyMigTax. Leveraging PyMigTax and our labeled
data, we investigate various characteristics of Python library migrations, such
as the types of program elements and properties of API mappings, the
combinations of types of migration-related code changes in a migration, and the
typical development effort required for a migration. Our findings highlight
various potential shortcomings of current library migration tools. For example,
we find that 40% of library pairs have API mappings that involve non-function
program elements, while most library migration techniques typically assume that
function calls from the source library will map into (one or more) function
calls from the target library. As an approximation for the development effort

production is hard; predicting them beforehand, even harder. A primer on
automatically learning to predict performance regressions in software, this
article gives an account of the experiences we gained when researching and
deploying an ML-based regression prediction pipeline at Meta. In this paper, we
report on a comparative study with four ML models of increasing complexity,
from (1) code-opaque, over (2) Bag of Words, (3) off-the-shelve
Transformer-based, to (4) a bespoke Transformer-based model, coined
SuperPerforator. Our investigation shows the inherent difficulty of the
performance prediction problem, which is characterized by a large imbalance of
benign onto regressing changes. Our results also call into question the general
applicability of Transformer-based architectures for performance prediction: an
off-the-shelve CodeBERT-based approach had surprisingly poor performance; our
highly customized SuperPerforator architecture initially achieved prediction
performance that was just on par with simpler Bag of Words models, and only
outperformed them for down-stream use cases. This ability of SuperPerforator to
transfer to an application with few learning examples afforded an opportunity
to deploy it in practice at Meta: it can act as a pre-filter to sort out
changes that are unlikely to introduce a regression, truncating the space of
changes to search a regression in by up to 43%, a 45x improvement over a random
baseline. To gain further insight into SuperPerforator, we explored it via a
series of experiments computing counterfactual explanations. These highlight
which parts of a code change the model deems important, thereby validating the

essential for the devices like optical switches and waveguides, as it can be
easily maneuvered by the application of suitable electromagnetic (EM) waves. In
this article, we report the development of a photoactive surface by the
deposition of a single layer of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of a novel H-shaped
liquid crystal (HLC) molecule. The synthesized HLC molecules possess azo-groups
and nitro-groups. The azo-group can be isomerized (trans-cis transformation) by
irradiating them with ultraviolet (UV) light. The nitro-group can provide
sufficient amphiphilicity to the HLC molecules to form a stable Langmuir
monolayer at air-water interface. The Langmuir monolayer of the HLC molecules
exhibited gas and liquid-like phases. A single layer of LB film of HLC
molecules was deposited on a gold chip of a home-built surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) instrument. The azo-groups of the molecules in LB film was
excited by UV irradiation leading to a change in morphology due to trans-cis
transformation. Such a change in morphology can lead to a miniscule change in
refractive index (RI) of the LB film. SPR is a label free and highly sensitive
optical phenomenon for the measurement of such changes in RI. In our studies,
we found systematic changes in the resonance angle of the LB film of HLC

"Chemical evolution in ices on drifting, planet-forming pebbles",2022-08-15T18:07:10Z,"Christian Eistrup, Thomas Henning","Planets and their atmospheres are built from gas and solid material in
protoplanetary disks. Recent results suggest that solid material like pebbles
may contribute significantly to building up planetary atmospheres. In order to
link observed exoplanet atmospheres and their compositions to their formation
histories, it is important to understand how icy pebbles may change their
composition when they drift radially inwards in disks. Our goal is to model the
compositional evolution of ices on pebbles as they drift in disks, and track
how their chemical evolution en-route changes the ice composition relative to
the ice composition of the pebbles in the region where they grew from
micron-sized grains. A state-of-the-art chemical kinetics code is utilised for
modelling chemical evolution. This code accounts for the time-evolving sizes of
the solids that drift. Chemical evolution is modelled locally for 0.1Myr at two
starting radii, with the micron-sized solids growing into pebbles
simultaneously. The pebbles and local gas, isolated as a parcel, is then
exposed to changing physical conditions, intended to mimic the pebbles drifting
inwards in the disk midplane, moving to 1 AU on three different timescales. A
modelling simplification is that the pebbles are \emph{not} moved through, and
exposed to new gas, but stay in the same chemical gas surroundings in all
models. For ice species with initial abundances relative to hydrogen of
$>10^{-5}$, such as H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, CH$_{3}$OH and NH$_{3}$, the abundances
change by less than 20% for both radii of origin, and for the two smaller drift
timescales (10kyr and 100kyr). For less abundant ice species, and the longest
drift timescale (1Myr), the changes are larger. Pebble drift chemistry
generally increases the ice abundances of CO$_{2}$, HCN and SO, at the expense
of decreasing abundances of other volatile molecules.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07390v1
"Spatiotemporal Cardiac Statistical Shape Modeling: A Data-Driven
  Approach",2022-09-06T18:00:45Z,"Jadie Adams, Nawazish Khan, Alan Morris, Shireen Elhabian","Clinical investigations of anatomy's structural changes over time could
greatly benefit from population-level quantification of shape, or
spatiotemporal statistic shape modeling (SSM). Such a tool enables
characterizing patient organ cycles or disease progression in relation to a
cohort of interest. Constructing shape models requires establishing a
quantitative shape representation (e.g., corresponding landmarks).
Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a data-driven SSM approach that captures
population-level shape variations by optimizing landmark placement. However, it
assumes cross-sectional study designs and hence has limited statistical power
in representing shape changes over time. Existing methods for modeling
spatiotemporal or longitudinal shape changes require predefined shape atlases
and pre-built shape models that are typically constructed cross-sectionally.
This paper proposes a data-driven approach inspired by the PSM method to learn
population-level spatiotemporal shape changes directly from shape data. We
introduce a novel SSM optimization scheme that produces landmarks that are in
correspondence both across the population (inter-subject) and across
time-series (intra-subject). We apply the proposed method to 4D cardiac data
from atrial-fibrillation patients and demonstrate its efficacy in representing
the dynamic change of the left atrium. Furthermore, we show that our method
outperforms an image-based approach for spatiotemporal SSM with respect to a
generative time-series model, the Linear Dynamical System (LDS). LDS fit using
a spatiotemporal shape model optimized via our approach provides better
generalization and specificity, indicating it accurately captures the
underlying time-dependency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02736v1

among brain regions vary over the course of an fMRI experiment. The transitions
between different individual connectivity states can be modulated by changes in
underlying physiological mechanisms that drive functional network dynamics,
e.g., changes in attention or cognitive effort as measured by pupil dilation.
In this paper, we develop a multi-subject Bayesian framework for estimating
dynamic functional networks as a function of time-varying exogenous
physiological covariates that are simultaneously recorded in each subject
during the fMRI experiment. More specifically, we consider a dynamic Gaussian
graphical model approach, where a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model is
employed to classify the fMRI time series into latent neurological states,
borrowing strength over the entire time course of the experiment. The
state-transition probabilities are assumed to vary over time and across
subjects, as a function of the underlying covariates, allowing for the
estimation of recurrent connectivity patterns and the sharing of networks among
the subjects. Our modeling approach further assumes sparsity in the network
structures, via shrinkage priors. We achieve edge selection in the estimated
graph structures, by introducing a multi-comparison procedure for
shrinkage-based inferences with Bayesian false discovery rate control. We apply
our modeling framework on a resting-state experiment where fMRI data have been
collected concurrently with pupillometry measurements, leading us to assess the
heterogeneity of the effects of changes in pupil dilation, previously linked to
changes in norepinephrine-containing locus coeruleus, on the subjects'
propensity to change connectivity states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01281v3

from which state-of-the-art settings developed global and local summary
statistics from asymptotic Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to detect changes in
random matrix law. These settings work only for uncorrelated pre-change

the hypothesis that we can improve state-of-the-art settings for QHD, by
combining QCD and QHD simultaneously, as well as including information about

uncertainty of the time series of measurements, where the emission distribution
of exceedances of a specific threshold is the focus of investigation. One of
the great contributions of the present algorithm is that all the days that
overflowed are candidates to be a change-point, so all the possible
configurations of overflow days are the possible chromosomes, which will unite
to have offspring. Under the heuristics of a genetic algorithm, the solution to
the problem of finding such change points will be guaranteed to be non-local

A Double Machine Learning Trend Model for Citizen Science Data,2022-10-27T15:08:05Z,"Daniel Fink, Alison Johnston, Matt Strimas-Mackey, Tom Auer, Wesley M. Hochachka, Shawn Ligocki, Lauren Oldham Jaromczyk, Orin Robinson, Chris Wood, Steve Kelling, Amanda D. Rodewald","1. Citizen and community-science (CS) datasets have great potential for
estimating interannual patterns of population change given the large volumes of
data collected globally every year. Yet, the flexible protocols that enable
many CS projects to collect large volumes of data typically lack the structure
necessary to keep consistent sampling across years. This leads to interannual
confounding, as changes to the observation process over time are confounded
with changes in species population sizes.
  2. Here we describe a novel modeling approach designed to estimate species
population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in
citizen science data. The approach is based on Double Machine Learning, a
statistical framework that uses machine learning methods to estimate population
change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding discovered in
the data. Additionally, we develop a simulation method to identify and adjust
for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores. Using this new
method, we can produce spatially detailed trend estimates from citizen science
data.
  3. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from
the CS project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the
method to estimate spatially varying trends in the face of real-world
confounding. Results showed that the trend estimates distinguished between
spatially constant and spatially varying trends at a 27km resolution. There
were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change
(increasing/decreasing) and high correlations on the estimated magnitude.
  4. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for
confounding in citizen science data has the potential to fill important
information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species, regions,
or seasons without rigorous monitoring data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15524v2

diffusion models have drawn substantial attention due to the high quality of
their generated images. A key desired property of image generative models is
the ability to disentangle different attributes, which should enable
modification towards a style without changing the semantic content, and the
modification parameters should generalize to different images. Previous studies
have found that generative adversarial networks (GANs) are inherently endowed
with such disentanglement capability, so they can perform disentangled image
editing without re-training or fine-tuning the network. In this work, we
explore whether diffusion models are also inherently equipped with such a
capability. Our finding is that for stable diffusion models, by partially
changing the input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., ""a photo of
person"") to one with style (e.g., ""a photo of person with smile"") while fixing
all the Gaussian random noises introduced during the denoising process, the
generated images can be modified towards the target style without changing the
semantic content. Based on this finding, we further propose a simple,
light-weight image editing algorithm where the mixing weights of the two text
embeddings are optimized for style matching and content preservation. This
entire process only involves optimizing over around 50 parameters and does not
fine-tune the diffusion model itself. Experiments show that the proposed method
can modify a wide range of attributes, with the performance outperforming
diffusion-model-based image-editing algorithms that require fine-tuning. The
optimized weights generalize well to different images. Our code is publicly

  Estimation for 3-D Video Coding",2022-01-07T12:12:41Z,"Jian Jin, Xingxing Zhang, Lili Meng, Weisi Lin, Jie Liang, Huaxiang Zhang, Yao Zhao","Recently, various view synthesis distortion estimation models have been
studied to better serve for 3-D video coding. However, they can hardly model
the relationship quantitatively among different levels of depth changes,
texture degeneration, and the view synthesis distortion (VSD), which is crucial
for rate-distortion optimization and rate allocation. In this paper, an
auto-weighted layer representation based view synthesis distortion estimation
model is developed. Firstly, the sub-VSD (S-VSD) is defined according to the
level of depth changes and their associated texture degeneration. After that, a
set of theoretical derivations demonstrate that the VSD can be approximately
decomposed into the S-VSDs multiplied by their associated weights. To obtain
the S-VSDs, a layer-based representation of S-VSD is developed, where all the
pixels with the same level of depth changes are represented with a layer to
enable efficient S-VSD calculation at the layer level. Meanwhile, a nonlinear
mapping function is learnt to accurately represent the relationship between the
VSD and S-VSDs, automatically providing weights for S-VSDs during the VSD
estimation. To learn such function, a dataset of VSD and its associated S-VSDs
are built. Experimental results show that the VSD can be accurately estimated
with the weights learnt by the nonlinear mapping function once its associated
S-VSDs are available. The proposed method outperforms the relevant

with 2D group-III phosphides: AlP and GaP. The planar structure of AlP and
low-buckled GaP have been taken to form the bilayer patterns. In each case,
three stacking patterns are considered, and their relaxed interlayer distance
and binding energy have been reported. The binding energy being around in the
range between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals
interactions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and
these two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude
range of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer
distance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain. Although
their normal bandgap, which significantly changes with SOC, is an indirect one,
whilst tunning the interlayer distance band gap jumps from unsymmetrical point
to symmetrical Dirac cones and becomes direct on K points. The charge carrier
mostly concentrates on the p-orbitals of the germanene in the conduction
regions; thus, the electrical properties of germanene will be retained, and the
carrier will provide a much faster device response property. The absence of the
phosphides influence makes them the intended substrate for growing the
germanene layer on top of that. Again, due to the bandgap at Dirac cones being
opened and jumps between the Dirac cones and band gap changes with SOC
tropological insulator can be formed, and Quantum Spin Hall effect may exist.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02676v1

due to a magnetic reconnection event in the accretion disk. The drop in
apparent radio luminosity can be explained by a change in free-free absorption,

electron density consistent with the broad line region (BLR). Our results are
consistent with magnetic reconnection events in the dynamic accretion disk

Simulations of AGN Driven Galactic Outflow Morphology and Content,2022-01-20T18:47:26Z,"Ryan Tanner, Kimberly Weaver","Using a series of 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) we investigate how AGN power, a clumpy ISM structure, and
AGN jet angle with respect to the galactic disk affect the morphology and
content of the resulting galactic outflow. For low power AGN across three
orders of magnitude of AGN luminosities ($10^{41}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) our
simulations did not show significant changes to either the morphology or total
mass of the outflow. Changing the angle of the AGN jet with respect to the
galaxy did show small changes in the total outflow mass of a factor of 2-3.
Jets perpendicular to the galactic disk were created hot single phase outflows,
while jets close to parallel with the disk created the outflows were
multi-phase with equal parts warm and hot, and significant cold gas. Overall
The final morphology of low power AGN outflows depends primarily on how the jet
impacts and interacts with large, dense clouds in the clumpy ISM. These clouds
can disrupt, deflect, split, or suppress the jet preventing it from leaving the
galactic disk as a coherent structure. But for simulations with AGN
luminosities $> 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ the ISM played a minor role in
determining the morphology of the outflow with an undisrupted jet leaving the
disk. The final morphology of AGN outflows is different for low power AGNs vs.
high power AGNs with the final morphology of low power AGN outflows dependent
on the ISM structure within the first kpc surrounding the AGN.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08360v1

intervals of higher X-ray luminosity. Although the data are limited, the excess
lags appear to scale with X-ray luminosity. Our modelling shows that lags
expected from reprocessing of X-rays by the accretion disc vary hardly at all
with increasing luminosity. Therefore, as the U-band excess almost certainly
arises from Balmer continuum emission from the broad line region (BLR), we
attribute these lag changes to changes in the contribution from the BLR. The
change is easily explained by the usual increase in the inner radius of the BLR

"Conflicting Effects of Extreme Nanoconfinement on the Translational and
  Segmental Motion of Entangled Polymers",2022-01-26T00:00:10Z,"R. Bharath Venkatesh, Daeyeon Lee","Physically confining polymers into nanoscale pores induces significant
changes in their dynamics. Although different results on the effect of
confinement on the dynamics of polymers have been reported, changes in the
segmental mobility of polymers typically are correlated with changes in their
chain mobility due to increased monomeric relaxation times. In this study, we
show that translational and segmental dynamics of polymers confined in
disordered packings of nanoparticles can exhibit completely opposite behavior.
We monitor the capillary rise dynamics of entangled polystyrene (PS) in
disordered packings of silica nanoparticles (NPs) of 7 and 27 nm diameter. The
effective viscosity of PS in 27 nm $SiO_2$ NP packings, inferred based on the
Lucas-Washburn equation, is significantly smaller than the bulk viscosity, and
the extent of reduction in the translational motion due to confinement
increases with the molecular weight of PS, reaching 4 orders of magnitude
reduction for PS with a molecular weight of 4M g/mol. The glass transition
temperature of entangled PS in the packings of 27 nm $SiO_2$ NPs, however,
increases by 45 K, indicating significant slowdown of segmental motion.
Interestingly, confinement of the polymers into packings made of 7 nm $SiO_2$
NPs results in molecular weight-independent effective viscosity. The segmental
dynamics of PS in 7 nm $SiO_2$ NP packings are slowed down even further as
evidenced by 65 K increase in glass transition temperature. These seemingly
disparate effects are explained by the microscopic reptation-like transport
controlling the translational motion and the physical confinement affecting the
segmental dynamics under extreme nanoconfinement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10681v1

with ground based telescopes as well as with satellites over the last decade.
It showed a variable light curve with additional repeating planetary
transit-like dips every ~0.8h. However, these dimming events changed in depth
and duration since their discovery and from autumn 2018 on, they were not even
present or near the predicted observing times. As reason for the detected dips
and their changes within the complex light curve, e.g. a disintegrating planet,
a circumstellar dust clump, stellar spots, possible multiplicity and orbiting
clouds at a Keplerian co-rotating radius were discussed and are still under
debate. In this paper, we present additional optical monitoring of CVSO30 with
the meter class telescopes of the Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative in Asia
and Europe over the last seven years and characterize CVSO30 with the new Early
Data Release 3 of the ESA Gaia Mission. As a result, we describe the evolution
of the dimming events in the optical wavelength range since 2014 and present
explanatory approaches for the observed variabilities. We conclude that
orbiting clouds of gas at a Keplerian co-rotating radius are the most promising
scenario to explain most changes in CVSO30's light curve.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12405v1
"Rank List Sensitivity of Recommender Systems to Interaction
  Perturbations",2022-01-29T23:43:21Z,"Sejoon Oh, Berk Ustun, Julian McAuley, Srijan Kumar","Prediction models can exhibit sensitivity with respect to training data:
small changes in the training data can produce models that assign conflicting
predictions to individual data points during test time. In this work, we study
this sensitivity in recommender systems, where users' recommendations are
drastically altered by minor perturbations in other unrelated users'
interactions. We introduce a measure of stability for recommender systems,
called Rank List Sensitivity (RLS), which measures how rank lists generated by
a given recommender system at test time change as a result of a perturbation in
the training data. We develop a method, CASPER, which uses cascading effect to
identify the minimal and systematical perturbation to induce higher instability
in a recommender system. Experiments on four datasets show that recommender
models are overly sensitive to minor perturbations introduced randomly or via
CASPER - even perturbing one random interaction of one user drastically changes
the recommendation lists of all users. Importantly, with CASPER perturbation,
the models generate more unstable recommendations for low-accuracy users (i.e.,
those who receive low-quality recommendations) than high-accuracy ones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12686v3

this external electrolyte film is in contact with any top permeable electrode
it produces a self-biasing effect and changes the charge carriers injection
properties. The outer-layer promoted situations where the output current
increases up to two orders of magnitude and others where the output current
decreases one order of magnitude in comparison to the same samples without it.
Admittance spectroscopy measurements were made and the proposed equivalent
circuit model indicates that the interfacial electrical properties dominate
charge injection face to the bulk properties when the outer-layer is present.
All the changes observed here are reversible after the ion gel is detached and
replaced, indicating that ions do not diffuse into the active layer. The
observed results can contribute to improve the current density in certain
sandwich structures as well as notify that electrolyte external films can
behave as an active layer promoting electrical changes into sandwich devices

end of the hard to soft transition of this outburst, Insight-HXMT found that
the source rapidly alternated between low flux and high flux states on a
timescale of hours. Two high flux states lasted only for a period comparable to
the orbital period of the observatory. Time-resolved spectral analysis shows
that the sudden changes of flux are confined in the hard X-ray band (>4 keV).
The variable non-thermal emission, including the power-law continuum from the
corona and the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk, is responsible
for the observed variability. The strength of disk thermal emission and the
inner radius of the accretion disk are consistent between the two flux states.
Assuming the lamppost geometry, our best-fit disk reflection models suggest a
very low corona height (within 3 $R_{\rm g}$) and there is no evidence of
significant variation in the corona geometry either. The observed rapidly
alternating flux states suggest that the intrinsic power of the corona must
change during the state transition. We discuss possible mechanisms for the

  oscillators network",2022-02-14T11:41:28Z,"Sheida Kazemi, Yousef Jamali","We investigate the dynamical properties of a network of coupled neural
oscillators with identical Jansen-Rit masses. The connections between nodes
follow the regular Watts-Strogatz topology. Each node receives deterministic
external input plus internal input based on the output signal from the
neighbors. This paper aims to change these two inputs and analyze the generated
results. First, we attempt to analyze the model using the mean-field
approximation, i.e., identical inputs for all nodes. Then, this assumption is
relaxed. A more detailed analysis of these two states is discussed. We use the
Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the amount of synchronization. As a
result of the mean-field approach, we find that despite observed changes in
behavior, there is no phase transition. Surprisingly, both the first
(discontinuous) and second (continuous) phase transition occurs by relaxing the
mean-field assumption. We also demonstrate how changes in input can result in
pathological oscillations similar to those observed in epilepsy. Results show
that coupled Jansen-Rit masses emerge a variety of behaviors influenced by
various external and internal inputs. Moreover, our findings indicate that
delta waves can be generated by altering these inputs in a network of
Jansen-Rit neural mass models, which has not been previously observed in a
single Jansen-Rit neural mass model analysis. \\ Overall, a wide range of
behavioral patterns, including epilepsy, healthy behavior, and the transition
between synchrony, and asynchrony are examined comprehensively in this paper.

Fast Dynamic Updates and Dynamic SpGEMM on MPI-Distributed Graphs,2022-02-17T18:23:43Z,"Alexander van der Grinten, Geert Custers, Duy Le Thanh, Henning Meyerhenke","Sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental kernel used in many
diverse application areas, both numerical and discrete. For example, many
algebraic graph algorithms rely on SpGEMM in the tropical semiring to compute
shortest paths in graphs. Recently, SpGEMM has received growing attention
regarding implementations for specific (parallel) architectures. Yet, this
concerns only the static problem, where both input matrices do not change. In
many applications, however, matrices (or their corresponding graphs) change
over time. Although recomputing from scratch is very expensive, we are not
aware of any dynamic SpGEMM algorithms in the literature. In this paper, we
thus propose a batch-dynamic algorithm for MPI-based parallel computing.
Building on top of a distributed graph/matrix data structure that allows for
fast updates, our dynamic SpGEMM reduces the communication volume
significantly. It does so by exploiting that updates change far fewer matrix
entries than there are non-zeros in the input operands. Our experiments with
popular benchmark graphs show that our approach pays off. For batches of
insertions or removals of matrix entries, our dynamic SpGEMM is substantially
faster than the static algorithms in the state-of-the-art competitors CombBLAS,

adequate information ... to make informed choices"" as a core consumer
protection right. However, problematic online reviews and imperfections in
algorithms that detect those reviews pose obstacles to the fulfillment of this
right. Research on reviews and review platforms often derives insights from a
single web crawl, but the decisions those crawls observe may not be static. A
platform may feature a review one day and filter it from view the next day. An
appreciation for these dynamics is necessary to understand how a platform
chooses which reviews consumers encounter and which reviews may be unhelpful or
suspicious. We introduce a novel longitudinal angle to the study of reviews. We
focus on ""reclassification,"" wherein a platform changes its filtering decision
for a review. To that end, we perform repeated web crawls of Yelp to create
three longitudinal datasets. These datasets highlight the platform's dynamic
treatment of reviews. We compile over 12.5M reviews--more than 2M
unique--across over 10k businesses. Our datasets are available for researchers
to use.
  Our longitudinal approach gives us a unique perspective on Yelp's classifier

between Yelp's two main classifier classes (""Recommended"" and ""Not
Recommended"")--up to 8% over eight years--raising concerns about prior works'
use of Yelp's classes as ground truth. These changes have impacts on small
scales; for example, a business going from a 3.5 to 4.5 star rating despite no
new reviews. Some reviews move multiple times: we observed up to five

this work, we tackle this issue by proposing RDP-Net: a region detail

the CNN learn from easy to hard. The training strategy enables CNN to learn
more powerful features with fewer FLOPs and achieve better performance. Next,
we propose an effective edge loss that increases the penalty for errors on
details and improves the network's attention to details such as boundary
regions and small areas. Furthermore, we provide a CNN model with a brand new
backbone that achieves the state-of-the-art empirical performance in CD with
only 1.70M parameters. We hope our RDP-Net would benefit the practical CD

Hydrodynamic signatures and spectral properties of the quantum vortex,2022-02-23T15:44:07Z,"João E. H. Braz, P. Ribeiro, H. Terças","We characterize the low-lying excitations of a quantum vortex in a

sensitive to complementary aspects of the excitation's spectrum. The latter
proves to be particularly relevant to studying the polaronic state realized
when an impurity is embedded in a quantum vortex. We establish that the
impurity becomes sensitive to the transversal fluctuations of the vortex, via
its remnant kelvon mode, and to the phase fluctuations of the BEC
Nambu-Goldstone mode. The presence of the vortex yields an anomalous excitation
spectrum with a finite energy gap and non-linear DOS at low energies. We find
that the high sensitivity of the kelvon mode to external potentials provides a
channel of quantum-level control over impurities trapped in a vortex. This
extra control channel may be of practical use for the proposal of using

unusual absorption spectra change with different incident angles. Thus, we
designed and fabricated a focal plane array with metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
structure metamaterial absorbers for further research. The absorption spectrum
with incident angles from 20 to 60 was measured using THz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS), and the experimental results reveal that the absorption
spectrum changes with incident angle variations. A basic analytical asymmetric
peak model for extracting absorption-frequency characteristics was developed in
this study to quantitatively explore this variation in the absorber behavior
with incident angles. The best result was that the frequency corresponding to
the highest absorption can be easily found using this peak model. The
experimental data was coherent with the validation of the asymmetric peak
model. Moreover, a second model to quantitatively relate parameters to the
incident angle was discovered, allowing for the prediction of absorption
spectrum shifts and changes. The absorption spectrum was predicted to have a
valley-like absorption curve at particular incident angles based on the

  Monte Carlo Tree Search",2022-02-25T22:31:37Z,"Geoffrey Pettet, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey","Decision-making under uncertainty (DMU) is present in many important
problems. An open challenge is DMU in non-stationary environments, where the
dynamics of the environment can change over time. Reinforcement Learning (RL),
a popular approach for DMU problems, learns a policy by interacting with a
model of the environment offline. Unfortunately, if the environment changes the
policy can become stale and take sub-optimal actions, and relearning the policy
for the updated environment takes time and computational effort. An alternative
is online planning approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which
perform their computation at decision time. Given the current environment, MCTS
plans using high-fidelity models to determine promising action trajectories.
These models can be updated as soon as environmental changes are detected to
immediately incorporate them into decision making. However, MCTS's convergence
can be slow for domains with large state-action spaces. In this paper, we
present a novel hybrid decision-making approach that combines the strengths of
RL and planning while mitigating their weaknesses. Our approach, called Policy
Augmented MCTS (PA-MCTS), integrates a policy's actin-value estimates into
MCTS, using the estimates to seed the action trajectories favored by the
search. We hypothesize that PA-MCTS will converge more quickly than standard
MCTS while making better decisions than the policy can make on its own when
faced with nonstationary environments. We test our hypothesis by comparing
PA-MCTS with pure MCTS and an RL agent applied to the classical CartPole
environment. We find that PC-MCTS can achieve higher cumulative rewards than
the policy in isolation under several environmental shifts while converging in
significantly fewer iterations than pure MCTS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13003v1

extremely valuable source for monitoring changes occurred on the earth surface.
However, precisely detecting relevant changes in VHR images still remains a
challenge, due to the complexity of the relationships among ground objects. To
address this limitation, a dual neighborhood hypergraph neural network is
proposed in this article, which combines the multiscale superpixel segmentation
and hypergraph convolution to model and exploit the complex relationships.
First, the bi-temporal image pairs are segmented under two scales and fed to a
pre-trained U-net to obtain node features by treating each object under the
fine scale as a node. The dual neighborhood is then defined using the
father-child and adjacent relationships of the segmented objects to construct
the hypergraph, which permits models to represent the higher-order structured
information far more complex than just pairwise relationships. The hypergraph
convolutions are conducted on the constructed hypergraph to propagate the label
information from a small amount of labeled nodes to the other unlabeled ones by
the node-edge-node transform. Moreover, to alleviate the problem of imbalanced
sample, the focal loss function is adopted to train the hypergraph neural
network. The experimental results on optical, SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR

detection system, MaMaDroid, which analyzes the control flow graph of the
application. Changes to the portion of benign samples in the train set and
models are considered to see their effect on the classifier. The changes in the
ratio between benign and malicious samples have a clear effect on each one of
the models, resulting in a decrease of more than 40% in their detection rate.
Moreover, adopted ML models are implemented as well, including 5-NN, Decision

different cases, of tree-based models and distance-based models. Moreover,
three novel attacks that manipulate the CFG and their detection rates are

universal VPR technique that can work in all types of environments, on a
variety of robotic platforms, and under a wide range of viewpoint and

VPR methods intelligently by evaluating complementarity for some specific VPR
datasets to achieve better performance. This, however, requires ground truth
information (correct matches) which is not available when a robot is deployed
in a real-world scenario. Moreover, running multiple VPR techniques in parallel
may be prohibitive for resource-constrained embedded platforms. To overcome
these limitations, this paper presents a probabilistic complementarity based
switching VPR system, SwitchHit. Our proposed system consists of multiple VPR
techniques, however, it does not simply run all techniques at once, rather
predicts the probability of correct match for an incoming query image and
dynamically switches to another complementary technique if the probability of
correctly matching the query is below a certain threshold. This innovative use
of multiple VPR techniques allow our system to be more efficient and robust
than other combined VPR approaches employing brute force and running multiple

Timelike vs null deceleration parameter in tilted Friedmann universes,2022-03-02T14:22:40Z,"Jessica Santiago, Christos G. Tsagas","Information exchanged between observers in the universe typically travels
along the null rays of the associated light signals. One may therefore
decompose the luminosity distance of a given radiation source along these null
geodesics, instead of the timelike worldlines of the emitting/receiving
observers. In so doing, one obtains (among others) the null counterparts of the
familiar Hubble and deceleration parameters. Although the timelike and the null
sets of these parameters coincide in an exact Friedmann universe, they
generally differ in perturbed cosmological models. The situation becomes more
involved in tilted cosmologies, namely in those equipped with two families of
relatively moving observers. There, the two observer groups generally disagree
on the values of these parameters, simply because of their relative motion.
Assuming a tilted, perturbed Friedmann universe with dust, we find that the
relative-motion effects alone can locally change the sign of the null
deceleration parameter from positive to negative, while at the same time the
host universe is globally decelerating. An exactly analogous effect has also
been reported with regard to the timelike deceleration parameter. The
difference is that, in the null case, the impact of the relative motion is
twice as strong, thus making it easier for the unsuspecting observers to
misinterpret a local change in the sign of the deceleration parameter as recent

galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to be from a compact region, the corona
situated in the vicinity of the central supermassive black holes (SMBH). The
shape of the X-ray continuum, among other factors, depends on the temperature
of the corona ($\rm{kT_{e}}$). The launch of the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array (NuSTAR) has led to the determination of the high energy
cut-off ($\rm{E_{cut}}$; and thereby $\rm{kT_{e}}$) in many AGN. In a handful
of sources, multiple observations with NuSTAR have also revealed changes in
$\rm{E_{cut}}$. In this work we aimed to investigate the variation in
$\rm{kT_{e}}$ in three AGN, namely NGC 3227, NGC 5548 and MR 2251$-$178 using
more than one epoch of data on a source from NuSTAR. We carried out spectral
analysis of multiple epochs of data acquired using NuSTAR on the three sources
including a few new observations not published so far. By fitting
Comptonization model to the data we determined the temperature of the corona
and also investigated changes in $\rm{kT_{e}}$ if any in these sources. In NGC
3227, we found evidence for variation in $\rm{kT_{e}}$. We found no correlation
of $\rm{kT_{e}}$, photon index ($\Gamma$), reflection fraction ($R$) and
optical depth ($\tau$) with flux, while, $\tau$ is found to anti-correlate with
$\rm{kT_{e}}$. These could be due to more than one physical process at work in
the source that causes the change in $\rm{kT_{e}}$. Conclusive evidence for the
variation in $\rm{kT_{e}}$ is not found in MR 2251$-$178 and NGC 5548.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02007v1

  Continual Learning",2022-03-08T01:37:00Z,"Lucas Caccia, Rahaf Aljundi, Nader Asadi, Tinne Tuytelaars, Joelle Pineau, Eugene Belilovsky","In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing
distribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Experience Replay
(ER), where a small subset of past data is stored and replayed alongside new
data, has emerged as a simple and effective learning strategy. In this work, we
focus on the change in representations of observed data that arises when
previously unobserved classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new
classes must be distinguished from previous ones. We shed new light on this
question by showing that applying ER causes the newly added classes'
representations to overlap significantly with the previous classes, leading to
highly disruptive parameter updates. Based on this empirical analysis, we
propose a new method which mitigates this issue by shielding the learned
representations from drastic adaptation to accommodate new classes. We show
that using an asymmetric update rule pushes new classes to adapt to the older
ones (rather than the reverse), which is more effective especially at task
boundaries, where much of the forgetting typically occurs. Empirical results
show significant gains over strong baselines on standard continual learning

"Probing phonon dynamics with multi-dimensional high harmonic carrier
  envelope phase spectroscopy",2022-03-09T20:16:07Z,"Ofer Neufeld, Jin Zhang, Umberto De Giovannini, Hannes Hubener, Angel Rubio","We explore pump-probe high harmonic generation (HHG) from monolayer
hexagonal-Boron-Nitride, where a terahertz pump excites coherent optical
phonons that are subsequently probed by an intense infrared pulse that drives
HHG. We find, through state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations, that the
structure of the emission spectrum is attenuated by the presence of coherent
phonons, and is no longer comprised of discrete harmonic orders, but rather of
a continuous emission in the plateau region. The HHG yield strongly oscillates
as a function of the pump-probe delay, corresponding to ultrafast changes in
the lattice such as bond compression or stretching. We further show that in the
regime where the excited phonon period and the pulse duration are of the same
order of magnitude, the HHG process becomes sensitive to the
carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the driving field, even though the pulse
duration is so long that no such sensitivity is observed in the absence of
coherent phonons. The degree of CEP sensitivity vs. pump-probe delay is shown
to be a highly selective measure for instantaneous structural changes in the
lattice, providing a new approach for ultrafast multi-dimensional
HHG-spectroscopy. Remarkably, the obtained temporal resolution for phonon
dynamics is ~1 femtosecond, which is much shorter than the probe pulse duration
because of the inherent sub-cycle contrast mechanism. Our work paves the way
towards novel routes of probing phonons and ultrafast material structural
changes and provides a mechanism for controlling the high harmonic response.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05033v1

evident change in the local structure at about 5.5 GPa indicating that the
evolution of the local structure under applied pressure seems to not follow
crystallographic changes (long range order). Nuclear forward scattering (NFS)
measurement reveal the development of magnetic ordering in BFTO at 5K with high
pressures. A progressive increase in magnetic order is observed with increase
in pressure at 5K. Further, NFS measurements carried out at constant pressure

representative technology to achieve carbon neutrality. The phase change
process exists typical phenomenon of asymmetry that affects the energy storage
performance. However, the mechanism of asymmetry is currently lack of
elaboration because the half domain model is always used to simplify the
numerical simulation and avoid the appearance of asymmetry. In this study, the
entire domain model and boundary conditions were adopted and numerically
simulated for the melting process of paraffin wax, i.e., the charging process
of energy storage. The nonlinear dynamics method was applied to explain the
asymmetric flow and heat transfer phenomenon. The three-stage characteristic
based on charging speed was proposed for charging process and was explained by
thermal conduction or natural convection. The asymmetric phenomenon was
elaborated on the cause of formation, change mechanism, and effect evaluation.
Results show that natural convection accounts for the multiple solutions
(including the asymmetric ones) of charging process. It is also pointed out
that asymmetric solutions can exist under symmetric geometry structure. To
accurately solve the charging process, it is necessary to use the entire domain
model. Both the charging speed and energy storage capacity have a positive
correlation with asymmetry. Thus, a potential idea for energy storage
application was proposed to increase the charging speed; that is, adding
thermal disturbance during the melting process to destroy flow stability and to
enhance convective heat transfer. The research methods and findings will

approximations of forward reachable sets for nonlinear control systems with
changed dynamics and diminished control authority, given an a priori computed
reachable set for the nominal system. The method functions by shrinking or
inflating a precomputed reachable set based on prior knowledge of the system's
trajectory deviation growth dynamics, depending on whether an inner
approximation or outer approximation is desired. These dynamics determine an
upper bound on the minimal deviation between two trajectories emanating from
the same point that are generated on the nominal system using nominal control
inputs, and by the impaired system based on the diminished set of control
inputs, respectively. The dynamics depend on the given Hausdorff distance bound
between the nominal set of admissible controls and the possibly unknown
impaired space of admissible controls, as well as a bound on the rate change
between the nominal and off-nominal dynamics. Because of its computational
efficiency compared to direct computation of the off-nominal reachable set,
this procedure can be applied to on-board fault-tolerant path planning and
failure recovery. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require
convexity of the reachable sets unlike our previous work, thereby making it
suitable for general use. We raise a number of implementational considerations

application to the heading dynamics of a ship, a lower triangular dynamical

First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying

phase offset from that below $1.5\times10^{38}$erg\,s$^{-1}$, which strongly
supports for a transition from a pencil beam to a fan beam, and thus for the

sudden change of emission pattern around $L_t$. The spin-up rate ($\dot{\nu}$)
is linearly correlated with luminosity ($L$) below $L_t$, consistent with the
prediction of a radiation pressure dominated (RPD) disk. The $\dot{\nu}-L$
relation flattens above $L_t$, indicating a less efficient transfer of angular
momentum and a change of accretion disk geometry above $L_t$. It is likely due

RILI: Robustly Influencing Latent Intent,2022-03-23T19:55:49Z,"Sagar Parekh, Soheil Habibian, Dylan P. Losey","When robots interact with human partners, often these partners change their
behavior in response to the robot. On the one hand this is challenging because
the robot must learn to coordinate with a dynamic partner. But on the other
hand -- if the robot understands these dynamics -- it can harness its own
behavior, influence the human, and guide the team towards effective
collaboration. Prior research enables robots to learn to influence other robots
or simulated agents. In this paper we extend these learning approaches to now
influence humans. What makes humans especially hard to influence is that -- not
only do humans react to the robot -- but the way a single user reacts to the
robot may change over time, and different humans will respond to the same robot
behavior in different ways. We therefore propose a robust approach that learns
to influence changing partner dynamics. Our method first trains with a set of
partners across repeated interactions, and learns to predict the current
partner's behavior based on the previous states, actions, and rewards. Next, we
rapidly adapt to new partners by sampling trajectories the robot learned with
the original partners, and then leveraging those existing behaviors to
influence the new partner dynamics. We compare our resulting algorithm to
state-of-the-art baselines across simulated environments and a user study where
the robot and participants collaborate to build towers. We find that our
approach outperforms the alternatives, even when the partner follows new or
unexpected dynamics. Videos of the user study are available here:

catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting is
associated with an abrupt loss of knowledge previously learned by a model when
the task, or more broadly the data distribution, being trained on changes. In
supervised learning problems this forgetting, resulting from a change in the
model's representation, is typically measured or observed by evaluating the
decrease in old task performance. However, a model's representation can change
without losing knowledge about prior tasks. In this work we consider the
concept of representation forgetting, observed by using the difference in
performance of an optimal linear classifier before and after a new task is
introduced. Using this tool we revisit a number of standard continual learning
benchmarks and observe that, through this lens, model representations trained
without any explicit control for forgetting often experience small
representation forgetting and can sometimes be comparable to methods which
explicitly control for forgetting, especially in longer task sequences. We also
show that representation forgetting can lead to new insights on the effect of
model capacity and loss function used in continual learning. Based on our

constructing prototypes of class samples when queried on old samples.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13381v2
Wave propagation and power deposition in blue-core helicon plasma,2022-03-25T01:23:55Z,"Lei Chang, Juan F. Caneses, Saikat C. Thakur, Huai-Qing Zhang","The wave propagation and power deposition in blue-core helicon plasma are
computed referring to recent experiments. It is found that the radial profile
of wave electric field peaks off-axis during the blue-core formation, and the
location of this peak is very close to that of particle transport barrier
observed in experiment; the radial profile of wave magnetic field shows
multiple radial modes inside the blue-core column, which is consistent with the
experimental observation of coherent high $m$ modes through Bessel function.
The axial profiles of wave field indicate that, once the blue-core mode has
been achieved, waves can only propagate inside the formed column with distinct
phase compared to that outside. The wave energy distribution shows a clear and
sharp boundary at the edge of blue-core column, besides which periodic
structures are observed and the axial periodicity inside is nearly twice that
outside. The dispersion relation inside the blue-core column exhibits multiple
modes, a feature of resonant cavity that selects different modes during
frequency variation, while the dispersion relation outside gives constant wave
number with changed frequency. The power deposition appears to be off-axis in
the radial direction and periodic in the axial direction, and mostly inside the
blue-core column. Analyses based on step-like function theory and introduced
blue-core constant provide consistent results. The equivalence of blue-core

vary over time. We call these unshaped scenarios, and the methods mentioned

called Unshaped Networks for Multi-Agent Systems (UNMAS) that adapts to the

mixing network to factorize the joint action-value. Its adaption to the change
in agent number is attributed to the nonlinear mapping from each-agent Q value
to the joint action-value with individual weights. Besides, in order to address
the change in action set, each agent constructs an individual action-value
network that is composed of two streams to evaluate the constant
environment-oriented subset and the varying unit-oriented subset. We evaluate
UNMAS on various StarCraft II micro-management scenarios and compare the

communication effort. However, we have little idea how the initiation and
termination of these relationships occurs across the lifespan. To explore this,
we analyse a national cellphone database to determine how and when changes in

three-year period. However, around 1-4% of alters change every year, with the
rate of change being higher among 17-21 year olds than older adults. Young
adult females terminate more of their opposite-gender relationships, while
older males are more persistent in trying to maintain relationships in decline.

  Facial Actions for Emotion Analysis",2022-03-29T18:02:12Z,"Xiaotian Li, Xiang Zhang, Huiyuan Yang, Wenna Duan, Weiying Dai, Lijun Yin","Emotion is an experience associated with a particular pattern of
physiological activity along with different physiological, behavioral and
cognitive changes. One behavioral change is facial expression, which has been
studied extensively over the past few decades. Facial behavior varies with a
person's emotion according to differences in terms of culture, personality,
age, context, and environment. In recent years, physiological activities have
been used to study emotional responses. A typical signal is the
electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain activity. Most of existing
EEG-based emotion analysis has overlooked the role of facial expression
changes. There exits little research on the relationship between facial
behavior and brain signals due to the lack of dataset measuring both EEG and
facial action signals simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose to
develop a new database by collecting facial expressions, action units, and EEGs
simultaneously. We recorded the EEGs and face videos of both posed facial
actions and spontaneous expressions from 29 participants with different ages,
genders, ethnic backgrounds. Differing from existing approaches, we designed a
protocol to capture the EEG signals by evoking participants' individual action
units explicitly. We also investigated the relation between the EEG signals and
facial action units. As a baseline, the database has been evaluated through the
experiments on both posed and spontaneous emotion recognition with images
alone, EEG alone, and EEG fused with images, respectively. The database will be
released to the research community to advance the state of the art for
automatic emotion recognition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15829v1
"Human wealth evolution is an accelerating expansion underpinned by a
  decelerating optimization process",2022-03-31T15:08:27Z,"Paolo Sibani, Steen Rasmussen, Per Lyngs Hansen","Optimization and expansion are two modes of staged evolution of complex
systems where macroscopic observables change at a decreasing, respectively
increasing, rate.
  A prime example of evolutionary expansion, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) time
series gauge economic activities in changing societal structures,} and the
accelerating trend of their growth probably reflects a manyfold increase of the
human interactions that drive change. We show how optimization and expansion
can coexist by replacing `wall clock time' $t$ as independent variable with a
measure of human interactions intensity $\tau$.
  Our analysis of eight centuries of yearly GDP data from three regions of
Western Europe is carried out in two steps. First, a Monte Carlo algorithm is
used to fit the GDP data to a piecewise continuous function comprising a
sequence of exponentials with different exponents.
  In a second step, GDP data are plotted vs. $\tau$ and shown to display two
logarithmic regimes, both decelerating, that are joined by a power-law
cross-over period.
  We connect the end of the first regime and the beginning of the second with
the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and the societal impact of new transport,
communication and production technologies that became widely available after
World War I.
  We conclude that wealth evolution in terms of $\tau$ is a decelerating

throughput is improved by optimally selecting the cooperating vehicles. We show
that analytical solutions for the optimal trajectories can be derived and are
guaranteed to satisfy safety constraints for all vehicles involved in the

Comments on Comments: Where Code Review and Documentation Meet,2022-03-31T21:41:35Z,"Nikitha Rao, Jason Tsay, Martin Hirzel, Vincent J. Hellendoorn","A central function of code review is to increase understanding; helping
reviewers understand a code change aids in knowledge transfer and finding bugs.
Comments in code largely serve a similar purpose, helping future readers
understand the program. It is thus natural to study what happens when these two
forms of understanding collide. We ask: what documentation-related comments do
reviewers make and how do they affect understanding of the contribution? We
analyze ca.700K review comments on 2,000 (Java and Python) GitHub projects, and
propose several filters to identify which comments are likely to be either in
response to a change in documentation and/or call for such a change. We

clarification, followed by pointing out issues to fix, such as typos and
outdated comments. Curiously, clarifying comments were frequently suggested

  Networks for Efficient Human Activity Recognition",2022-03-31T22:52:43Z,"Randy Ardywibowo, Shahin Boluki, Zhangyang Wang, Bobak Mortazavi, Shuai Huang, Xiaoning Qian","In many machine learning tasks, input features with varying degrees of
predictive capability are acquired at varying costs. In order to optimize the
performance-cost trade-off, one would select features to observe a priori.
However, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of
predictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the
challenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic
and light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before
actually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle
FDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight
Dynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature
subset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that
characterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its
core is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent
on previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to
observe. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the
performance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice. Extensive results
demonstrate that VFDS selects different features under changing contexts,
notably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy.
Moreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be
interpretable and associated with the different activity types. We will release

Time-lapse data matching using a recurrent neural network approach,2022-04-02T21:42:41Z,"Abdullah Alali, Vladimir Kazei, Bingbing Sun, Tariq Alkhalifah","Time-lapse seismic data acquisition is an essential tool to monitor changes
in a reservoir due to fluid injection, such as CO$_2$ injection. By acquiring
multiple seismic surveys in the exact location, we can identify the reservoir
changes by analyzing the difference in the data. However, such analysis can be
skewed by the near-surface seasonal velocity variations, inaccuracy in the
acquisition parameters, and other inevitable noise. The common practice
(cross-equalization) to address this problem uses the part of the data where
changes are not expected to design a matching filter and then apply it to the
whole data, including the reservoir area. Like cross-equalization, we train a
recurrent neural network on parts of the data excluding the reservoir area and
then infer the reservoir-related data. The recurrent neural network can learn
the time dependency of the data, unlike the matching filter that processes the
data based on the local information obtained in the filter window. We
demonstrate the method of matching the data in various examples and compare it
with the conventional matching filter. Specifically, we start by demonstrating
the ability of the approach in matching two traces and then test the method on
a pre-stack 2D synthetic data. Then, we verify the enhancements of the 4D

root mean square and predictability metrics and show that in some cases, it
overcomes the matching filter approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00941v1
"An efficient real-time target tracking algorithm using adaptive feature
  fusion",2022-04-05T08:40:52Z,"Yanyan Liu, Changcheng Pan, Minglin Bie, Jin Li","Visual-based target tracking is easily influenced by multiple factors, such
as background clutter, targets fast-moving, illumination variation, object
shape change, occlusion, etc. These factors influence the tracking accuracy of
a target tracking task. To address this issue, an efficient real-time target
tracking method based on a low-dimension adaptive feature fusion is proposed to
allow us the simultaneous implementation of the high-accuracy and real-time
target tracking. First, the adaptive fusion of a histogram of oriented gradient
(HOG) feature and color feature is utilized to improve the tracking accuracy.
Second, a convolution dimension reduction method applies to the fusion between
the HOG feature and color feature to reduce the over-fitting caused by their
high-dimension fusions. Third, an average correlation energy estimation method
is used to extract the relative confidence adaptive coefficients to ensure
tracking accuracy. We experimentally confirm the proposed method on an OTB100
data set. Compared with nine popular target tracking algorithms, the proposed
algorithm gains the highest tracking accuracy and success tracking rate.
Compared with the traditional Sum of Template and Pixel-wise LEarners (STAPLE)
algorithm, the proposed algorithm can obtain a higher success rate and
accuracy, improving by 0.023 and 0.019, respectively. The experimental results
also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach the real-time target
tracking with 50 fps. The proposed method paves a more promising way for
real-time target tracking tasks under a complex environment, such as appearance

assumption is adequate for handling datasets exhibiting strong serial and

model that simultaneously allows for strong correlations as well as structural
changes, where pervasive serial and cross-sectional correlations are accounted
for by a time-varying factor structure, and any remaining idiosyncratic

fully addresses the challenges arising from the latency of the component

their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection,
commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate.
Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by
analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors.
Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity,
and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by

context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around
190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we
find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their
vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme
changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently
in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can
mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms
of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large

of problems. In this paper, we focus on the reproducibility of simulation
experiments for parameters of DMOPs. Our framework is based on an extension of
PlatEMO, allowing for the reproduction of results and performance measurements

maximum capability of non-dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, we
can establish the minimum capability required of purpose-built dynamic
algorithms to be useful. The simplest modifications to manage dynamic changes
introduce diversity. Allowing non-dynamic algorithms to incorporate

to data extraction use machine learning or program synthesis to process the
whole document to extract the desired fields. Such approaches are not robust to
format changes in the document, and the extraction process typically fails even
if changes are made to parts of the document that are unrelated to the desired
fields of interest. We propose a new approach to data extraction based on the
concepts of landmarks and regions. Humans routinely use landmarks in manual
processing of documents to zoom in and focus their attention on small regions
of interest in the document. Inspired by this human intuition, we use the
notion of landmarks in program synthesis to automatically synthesize extraction
programs that first extract a small region of interest, and then automatically
extract the desired value from the region in a subsequent step. We have

vortices injecting volume having bulk concentration into the ion-depleted
diffusion layer at the interface. Experimental quantification of these
important flow patterns have so far only been carried out in 2D. Numerical
direct simulations suggest 3D features, yet experimental proof is lacking. 3D

  This study presents a new comprehensive experimental method for the

  We visualize coherent vortex structures and reveal the changes in the
velocity field and its statistics during the transition from vortex rolls to
vortex rings with increasing current density. The transition is characterized
by changes in the rotational direction, mean square velocity, and temporal
energy spectrum with only little influence on the spatial spectrum. These
findings indicate a more significant impact of EC's structural change on the

method of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves
infinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find

the 35-day cycle has been debatable. The X-ray pulse frequency of Her X-1

the Main-on state of the source. We explain the observed periodic
sub-microsecond pulse frequency changes by the free precession of a triaxial

of the X-ray pulse evolution over the 35-day cycle. In the Fermi/GBM data, we
identified several time intervals with a duration of half a year or longer
where the neutron star precession period describing the pulse frequency
variations does not change. We found that the NS precession period varies
within one per cent in different intervals. Such variations in the free

"""Double-path"" ferroelectrics and the sign of the piezoelectric response",2022-04-14T14:48:48Z,"Yubo Qi, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo, Karin M. Rabe","In this work, we propose a class of ferroelectrics (which we denote
""double-path"" ferroelectrics), characterized by two competing polarization
switching paths for which the change in polarization is different and in fact
of opposite sign. Depending on which path is favorable under given conditions,
this leads to different identification of up- and down-polarized states. Since
the sign of piezoelectric response depends on the assignment of up- or
down-polarized state for a specific structure, this means that the material can
exhibit different signs of the piezoelectric response under different
conditions. We focus on HfO$_2$ as a key example. Our first-principles
calculations show that there are two competing paths in HfO$_2$, resulting from
different displacements of the atoms from the initial to the final structures,
and the change in polarization along these two paths is of opposite sign. These
results provide a natural explanation for the recently observed discrepancy in
the signs of piezoelectric responses in HfO$_2$ between theoretical
first-principles calculations and experimental observation. Further, this
allows predictions of how to favor one path over another by changes in
conditions and compositional tuning. This family of materials also includes
other candidates, such as CuInP$_2$S$_6$ and theoretically proposed

  Robotic Gripper",2022-04-14T17:56:01Z,"Sandra Q. Liu, Edward H. Adelson","To adapt to constantly changing environments and be safe for human
interaction, robots should have compliant and soft characteristics as well as
the ability to sense the world around them. Even so, the incorporation of
tactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is
difficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be
modified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile
sensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant
properties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is
difficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid
and function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only
from tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic
finger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its
tactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a
GelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any
object it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile
reconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear
and torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots
to perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the
finger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass
reorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision
sensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing
technology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers,
increasing their viability in many different fields.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07146v1

which includes the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere, over more than one
fourth of Titan's year (2006-2014, LS=318{\deg}-60{\deg}), using eighteen

distributions of parameters in the retrieval, which inherently tests the extent
to which species profiles can be constrained. The results show that no change
of the species profiles is noticeable before the equinox, while the decrease of
atmospheric temperature and significant upwelling in the summer hemisphere are
found five terrestrial years afterwards. Altitude of the detached haze layer
decreases towards the vernal equinox then it disappears, and no reappearance is

Wireless Semantic Communications for Video Conferencing,2022-04-16T12:41:17Z,"Peiwen Jiang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin, Geoffrey Ye Li","Video conferencing has become a popular mode of meeting even if it consumes
considerable communication resources. Conventional video compression causes
resolution reduction under limited bandwidth. Semantic video conferencing
maintains high resolution by transmitting some keypoints to represent motions
because the background is almost static, and the speakers do not change often.
However, the study on the impact of the transmission errors on keypoints is
limited. In this paper, we initially establish a basal semantic video
conferencing (SVC) network, which dramatically reduces transmission resources
while only losing detailed expressions. The transmission errors in SVC only
lead to a changed expression, whereas those in the conventional methods destroy
pixels directly. However, the conventional error detector, such as the cyclic
redundancy check, cannot reflect the degree of expression changes. To overcome
this issue, we develop an incremental redundancy hybrid automatic
repeat-request (IR-HARQ) framework for the varying channels (SVC-HARQ)
incorporating a novel semantic error detector. The SVC-HARQ has flexibility in
bit consumption and achieves good performance. In addition, SVC-CSI is designed
for channel state information (CSI) feedback to allocate the keypoint
transmission and enhance the performance dramatically. Simulation shows that

Optimizing differential equations to fit data and predict outcomes,2022-04-16T16:08:08Z,Steven A. Frank,"Many scientific problems focus on observed patterns of change or on how to
design a system to achieve particular dynamics. Those problems often require
fitting differential equation models to target trajectories. Fitting such
models can be difficult because each evaluation of the fit must calculate the
distance between the model and target patterns at numerous points along a
trajectory. The gradient of the fit with respect to the model parameters can be
challenging. Recent technical advances in automatic differentiation through
numerical differential equation solvers potentially change the fitting process
into a relatively easy problem, opening up new possibilities to study dynamics.
However, application of the new tools to real data may fail to achieve a good
fit. This article illustrates how to overcome a variety of common challenges,
using the classic ecological data for oscillations in hare and lynx
populations. Models include simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which use artificial neural
networks to estimate the derivatives of differential equation systems.
Comparing the fits obtained with ODEs versus NODEs, representing small and
large parameter spaces, and changing the number of variable dimensions provide
insight into the geometry of the observed and model trajectories. To analyze
the quality of the models for predicting future observations, a
Bayesian-inspired preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (pSGLD)
calculation of the posterior distribution of predicted model trajectories
clarifies the tendency for various models to underfit or overfit the data.
Coupling fitted differential equation systems with pSGLD sampling provides a

fixed time budget. To this end, we collect a new dataset of occupancy maps
starting from existing datasets of 3D spaces and generating a number of
possible layouts for a single environment. This dataset can be employed in the
popular Habitat simulator and is fully compliant with existing methods that
employ reconstructed occupancy maps during navigation. Furthermore, we propose
an exploration policy that can take advantage of previous knowledge of the
environment and identify changes in the scene faster and more effectively than
existing agents. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for exploration on this new
setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08502v1
Scattering phenomena for spin transport in Kitaev spin liquid,2022-04-25T12:02:44Z,"Joji Nasu, Yuta Murakami, Akihisa Koga","The Kitaev model exhibits a canonical quantum spin liquid as a ground state
and hosts two fractional quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana fermion and
localized flux excitation. The former can carry heat and spin modulations in
the quantum spin liquid, but the role of the latter remains unknown for the
transport phenomena. Here, we focus on spin transport in the presence of
excited fluxes and report that they yield strong interference in the
propagation of the Majorana fermions, which feel gauge-like potential emergent
around the fluxes. We examine the transient spin dynamics triggered by a pulsed
magnetic field at an edge. In the absence of excited fluxes, the magnetic-field
pulse creates the plane wave of the Majorana fermions, which flows in the
quantum spin liquid. Although this wave does not accompany the change of local
spin moments in bulk, it induces local moments at the side opposite to the edge
under the magnetic-field pulse. We observe the spatial modulation of induced
spin moments when fluxes are excited in the bulk region. This behavior is more
striking than the case of lattice defects. Moreover, we find that, although the
amplitude of the spatial change is almost independent of the distance between
lattice defects, it is strongly enhanced by increasing the distance for the
case of excited fluxes. The difference is understood from the influence on the
itinerant Majorana fermions; the lattice defects change the system locally, but
flux excitations alter all the transfer integrals on the string connecting
them. The present results will provide another route to observing intrinsic
flux excitations distinguished from extrinsic effects such as lattice defects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11578v1
"Quantifying the selective, stochastic, and complementary drivers of the
  institutional evolution in online communities",2022-04-26T18:11:14Z,"Qiankun Zhong, Seth Frey, Martin Hilbert","Institutions and cultures evolve adaptively in response to the current
environmental incentives, usually. But sometimes institutional change is due to
stochastic drives beyond current fitness, including drift, path dependency,
blind imitation, and complementary cooperation in fluctuating environments.
Disentangling the selective and stochastic components of social system change
enables us to identify the key features to organizational development in the
long run. Evolutionary approaches provide organizational science abundant
theories to demonstrate organizational evolution by tracking particular
beneficial or harmful features. We measure these different drivers empirically
in institutional evolution among 20,000 Minecraft communities with the help of
two of the most applied evolutionary models, the Price equation and the
bet-hedging model. As a result, we find strong selection pressure on
administrative rules and information rules, suggesting that their positive
correlation with community fitness is the main reason for their frequency
change. We also find that stochastic drives decrease the average frequency of
administrative rules. The result makes sense when explained in light of
evolutionary bet-hedging. We show through the bet-hedging result that
institutional diversity contributes to the growth and stability of rules
related to information, communication, and economic behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12521v2
"Autoencoder based Hybrid Multi-Task Predictor Network for Daily
  Open-High-Low-Close Prices Prediction of Indian Stocks",2022-04-28T11:42:20Z,"Debasrita Chakraborty, Susmita Ghosh, Ashish Ghosh","Stock prices are highly volatile and sudden changes in trends are often very
problematic for traditional forecasting models to handle. The standard Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are regarded as the state-of-the-art models
for such predictions. But, these models fail to handle sudden and drastic
changes in the price trend. Moreover, there are some inherent constraints with
the open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices of the stocks. Literature lacks the
study on the inherent property of OHLC prices. We argue that predicting the
OHLC prices for the next day is much more informative than predicting the
trends of the stocks as the trend is mostly calculated using these OHLC prices
only. The problem mainly is focused on Buy-Today Sell-Tomorrow (BTST) trading.
In this regard, AEs when pre-trained with the stock prices, may be beneficial.
A novel framework is proposed where a pre-trained encoder is cascaded in front
of the multi-task predictor network. This hybrid network can leverage the power
of a combination of networks and can both handle the OHLC constraints as well
as capture any sudden drastic changes in the prices. It is seen that such a
network is much more efficient at predicting stock prices. The experiments have
been extended to recommend the most profitable and most overbought stocks on
the next day. The model has been tested for multiple Indian companies and it is
found that the recommendations from the proposed model have not resulted in a
single loss for a test period of 300 days.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13422v1

  Turbine-Governor Configuration for Microgrid Studies",2022-04-29T05:56:06Z,"Chinmay Shah, Mariko Shirazi, Richard Wies, Phylicia Cicilio, Timothy Hansen, Reinaldo Tonkoski","Diesel electric generators are an inherent part of remote hybrid microgrids
found in remote regions of the world that provide primary frequency response
(PFR) to restore system frequency during load or generation changes. However,
with inverter-based resources (IBR) integration into microgrids, the IBR
control provides a fast frequency response (FFR) to restore the system
frequency. Hence, supplementing PFR with FFR requires a sophisticated control
system and a high fidelity diesel electric generator model to design these
control systems. In this work, a high-fidelity model of a diesel electric
generator is developed. Its parameters are tuned using a surrogate optimization
algorithm by emulating its response during a load change to a 400 kVA
Caterpillar C-15 diesel generator, similar to those found in remote microgrids.
The diesel electric generator model consists of a synchronous machine, DC4B
excitation with V/Hz limiter, and a proposed modified IEEE GGOV1
engine-governor model (GGOV1D). The performance of the GGOV1D is compared with
simple, Woodward DEGOV, and a standard IEEE GGOV1 engine-governor model.
Results show that error in the diesel electric generator's response to load

during the arresting and rebound period than the other engine-governor models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13894v1
Periodic signature change in spacetimes of embedding class one,2022-04-29T16:55:46Z,Peter K. F. Kuhfittig,"The idea of an oscillating Universe has remained a topic of interest even
after the discovery of dark energy. This paper confirms this idea by means of
another well-established theory in general relativity, the embedding of curved
spacetimes in higher-dimensional flat spacetimes: an $n$-dimensional Riemannian
space is said to be of embedding class $m$ if $m+n$ is the lowest dimension $d$
of the flat space in which the given space can be embedded; here
$d=\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$. So a four-dimensional Riemannian space is of class two
since it can be embedded in a six-dimensional flat space. A line element of
class two can be reduced to a line element of class one by a suitable
coordinate transformation. The extra dimension can be either spacelike or
timelike, leading to accelerating and decelerating expansions, respectively.
Accordingly, it is proposed in this paper that the free parameter occurring in
the transformation be a periodic function of time. The result is a mathematical
model that can be interpreted as a periodic change in the signature of the
embedding space. This signature change may be the best model for an oscillating
Universe and complements various models proposed in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14222v3
Shape Change and Control of Pressure-based Soft Agents,2022-05-01T13:36:27Z,Federico Pigozzi,"Biological agents possess bodies that are mostly of soft tissues. Researchers
have resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related
questions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun.
Nevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose
unique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Here we
propose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely Pressure-based Soft Agents
(PSAs): they are bodies of gas enveloped by a chain of springs and masses, with
pressure pushing on the masses from inside the body. Pressure endows the agents
with structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents
to assume a large gamut of shapes. Actuation takes place by changing the length
of springs or modulating global pressure. We optimize the controller of PSAs
for a locomotion task on hilly terrain and an escape task from a cage; the
latter is particularly suitable for soft-bodied agents, as it requires the
agent to contort itself to squeeze through a small aperture. Our results
suggest that PSAs are indeed effective at those tasks and that controlling
pressure is fundamental for shape-changing. Looking forward, we envision PSAs
to play a role in the modeling of soft-bodied agents, including soft robots and
biological cells. Videos of evolved agents are available at

"Antigenic cooperation in Viral Populations: Transformation of Functions
  of Intra-Host Viral Variants",2022-05-02T16:29:18Z,"Leonid Bunimovich, Athulya Ram, Pavel Skums","In this paper we study intra-host viral adaptation by antigenic cooperation -
a mechanism of immune escape that serves as an alternative to the standard
mechanism of escape by continuous genomic diversification and allows to explain
a number of experimental observations associated with the establishment of
chronic infections by highly mutable viruses. Within this mechanism, the
topology of a cross-immunoreactivity network forces intra-host viral variants
to specialize for complementary roles and adapt to host's immune response as a
quasi-social ecosystem. Here we study dynamical changes in immune adaptation
caused by evolutionary and epidemiological events. First, we show that the
emergence of a viral variant with altered antigenic features may result in a
rapid re-arrangement of the viral ecosystem and a change in the roles played by
existing viral variants. In particular, it may push the population under immune
escape by genomic diversification towards the stable state of adaptation by
antigenic cooperation. Next, we study the effect of a viral transmission
between two chronically infected hosts, which results in merging of two
intra-host viral populations in the state of stable immune-adapted equilibrium.
In this case, we also describe how the newly formed viral population adapts to
the host's environment by changing the functions of its members. The results
are obtained analytically for minimal cross-immunoreactivity networks and
numerically for larger populations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01014v2
Five Ps: Leverage Zones Towards Responsible AI,2022-04-20T04:20:14Z,"Ehsan Nabavi, Chris Browne","There is a growing debate amongst academics and practitioners on whether
interventions made, thus far, towards Responsible AI would have been enough to
engage with root causes of AI problems. Failure to effect meaningful changes in
this system could see these initiatives to not reach their potential and lead
to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their
marketing campaigns. We propose that there is an opportunity to improve the
extent to which interventions are understood to be effective in their
contribution to the change required for Responsible AI. Using the notions of
leverage zones adapted from the 'Systems Thinking' literature, we suggest a
novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, to focus on
those that may bring about the real change that is needed. In this paper we
argue that insights from using this perspective demonstrate that the majority
of current initiatives taken by various actors in the field, focus on low-order
interventions, such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating
parameters, absent from higher-order interventions, such as redefining the
system's foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging
the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in

Quantized mass-energy effects in an Unruh-DeWitt detector,2022-05-05T01:58:18Z,"Carolyn E. Wood, Magdalena Zych","A simple but powerful particle detector model consists of a two-level system
coupled to a field, where the detected particles are the field excitations.
This is known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. Research using this model has often
focused on either a completely classical description of the external degrees of
freedom of the detector, or a full field-theoretic treatment, where the
detector itself is described as a field. Recently there has been much interest
in quantum aspects of the detector's center of mass -- either described as
moving in superposition along semiclassical trajectories, or dynamically
evolving under a non-relativistic Hamiltonian. However, the processes of
interest -- the absorption or emission of field particles -- necessarily change
the detector's rest mass by the amount of energy of the absorbed or emitted
field quanta. Neither of the above models can capture such effects. Here we
incorporate the quantization of the detector's mass-energy into the
Unruh-DeWitt model. We show that internal energy changes due to emission or
absorption are relevant even in the lowest energy limit. Specifically,
corrections to transition rates due to the detector's mass changing cannot be
ignored unless the entire center of mass dynamics is also ignored. Our results
imply that one cannot have a consistent model of the Unruh-DeWitt detector as a
massive particle without including the mass-energy equivalence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02394v2

dysfunction caused by liver failure. Altered synaptic plasticity is supposed to
play a major role in the pathophysiology of HE. Here, we used paired
associative stimulation with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25), a
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol, to test synaptic plasticity
of the motor cortex in patients with manifest HE. Methods: 23 HE-patients and
23 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Motor evoked potential (MEP)
amplitudes were assessed as measure for cortical excitability. Time courses of
MEP amplitude changes after the PAS25 intervention were compared between both
groups. Results: MEP-amplitudes increased after PAS25 in the control group,
indicating PAS25-induced synaptic plasticity in healthy controls, as expected.
In contrast, MEP-amplitudes within the HE group did not change and were lower
than in the control group, indicating no induction of plasticity. Conclusion:
Our study revealed reduced synaptic plasticity of the primary motor cortex in
HE. Significance: Reduced synaptic plasticity in HE provides a link between
pathological changes on the molecular level and early clinical symptoms of the
disease. This decrease may be caused by disturbances in the glutamatergic
neurotransmission due to the known hyperammonemia in HE patients.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02465v2
Geometry-induced patterns through mechanochemical coupling,2022-05-05T17:51:34Z,"Laeschkir Würthner, Andriy Goychuk, Erwin Frey","Intracellular protein patterns regulate a variety of vital cellular processes
such as cell division and motility, which often involve dynamic changes of cell
shape. These changes in cell shape may in turn affect the dynamics of
pattern-forming proteins, hence leading to an intricate feedback loop between
cell shape and chemical dynamics. While several computational studies have
examined the resulting rich dynamics, the underlying mechanisms are not yet
fully understood. To elucidate some of these mechanisms, we explore a
conceptual model for cell polarity on a dynamic one-dimensional manifold. Using
concepts from differential geometry, we derive the equations governing
mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems on time-evolving manifolds.
Analyzing these equations mathematically, we show that dynamic shape changes of
the membrane can induce pattern-forming instabilities in parts of the membrane,
which we refer to as regional instabilities. Deformations of the local membrane
geometry can also (regionally) suppress pattern formation and spatially shift
already existing patterns. We explain our findings by applying and generalizing
the local equilibria theory of mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems. This
allows us to determine a simple onset criterion for geometry-induced
pattern-forming instabilities, which is linked to the phase-space structure of
the reaction-diffusion system. The feedback loop between membrane shape
deformations and reaction-diffusion dynamics then leads to a surprisingly rich
phenomenology of patterns, including oscillations, traveling waves, and
standing waves that do not occur in systems with a fixed membrane shape. Our
work reveals that the local conformation of the membrane geometry acts as an
important dynamical control parameter for pattern formation in mass-conserving
reaction-diffusion systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02820v1
Isomorphs in sheared binary Lennard-Jones glass: Transient response,2022-05-09T14:40:08Z,"Yonglun Jiang, Eric R. Weeks, Nicholas P. Bailey","We have studied shear deformation of binary Lennard-Jones glasses to
investigate the extent to which the transient part of the stress strain curves
is invariant when the thermodynamic state point is varied along an isomorph.
Shear deformations were carried out on glass samples of varying stability,
determined by cooling rate, and at varying strain rates, at a state point deep
in the glass. Density changes up to and exceeding a factor of two were made. We
investigated several different methods for generating isomorphs but none of the
previously developed methods could generate sufficiently precise isomorphs
given the large density changes and non-equilibrium situation. Instead, the
temperatures for these higher densities were chosen to give state points
isomorphic to the starting state point by requiring the steady state flow
stress for isomorphic state points to be invariant in reduced units. In
contrast to the steady state flow stress, we find that the peak stress on the
stress strain curve is not invariant. The peak stress decreases by a few
percent for each ten percent increase in density, although the differences
decrease with increasing density. Analysis of strain profiles and non-affine
motion during the transient phase suggests that the root of the changes in peak
stress is a varying tendency to form shear bands, with the largest tendency
occurring at the lowest densities. We argue that this reflects the effective
steepness of the potential; a higher effective steepness gives a greater
tendency to form shear bands.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04340v2

  rule in PdCoO$_2$ thin films",2022-05-10T16:21:13Z,"David Barbalas, Anaëlle Legros, Gaurab Rimal, Seongshik Oh, N. P. Armitage","The observation of hydrodynamic transport in the metallic delafossite
PdCoO$_2$ has increased interest in this family of highly conductive oxides,
but experimental studies so far have mostly been confined to bulk crystals. In
this work, the development of high-quality thin films of PdCoO$_2$ has enabled
a thorough study of the conductivity as a function of film thickness using both
dc transport and time-domain THz spectroscopy. With increasing film thickness
from 12 nm to 102 nm, the residual resistivity decreases and we observe a large
deviation from Matthiessen's rule (DMR) in the temperature dependence of the
resistivity. We find that the complex THz conductivity is well fit by a single
Drude term. We fit the data to extract the spectral weight and scattering rate
simultaneously. The temperature dependence of the Drude scattering rate is
found to be nearly independent of the residual resistivity and cannot be the
primary mechanism for the observed DMR. Rather, we observe large changes in the
spectral weight as a function of disorder, changing by a factor of 1.5 from the
most disordered to least disordered films. We believe this corresponds to a
mass enhancement of $\geq 2$ times the value of the bulk effective mass which
increases with residual disorder. This suggests that the mechanism behind the
DMR observed in dc resistivity is primarily driven by changes in the electron
mass. We discuss the possible origins of this behavior including the
possibility of disorder-enhanced electron-phonon scattering, which can be
systematically tuned by film thickness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05006v2

tremendous boost to the search for sub-leading effects due to several beyond
the Standard Model scenarios in neutrino oscillation experiments. Among these,
two of the well-studied scenarios are Lorentz violation (LV) and non-standard
interactions (NSI), both of which can affect neutrino oscillations
significantly. We point out that, at a long-baseline experiment where the
neutrino oscillation probabilities can be well-approximated by using the
line-averaged constant matter density, the effects of these two scenarios can
mimic each other. This would allow the limits obtained at such an experiment on
one of the above scenarios to be directly translated to the limits on the other
scenario. However, for the same reason, it would be difficult to distinguish
between LV and NSI at a long-baseline experiment. We show that the observations
of atmospheric neutrinos, which travel a wide range of baselines and may
encounter sharp density changes at the core-mantle boundary, can break this
degeneracy. We observe that identifying neutrinos and antineutrinos separately,
as can be done at INO-ICAL, can enhance the capability of atmospheric neutrino
experiments to discriminate between these two new-physics scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05134v2

handling difficult, how these impact the emotions of software practitioners,
what influences their RC handling, and how RC handling can be made less
emotionally challenging. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach. We
conducted two survey studies, with 40 participants and 201 participants
respectively. The presentation of key quantitative data was followed by
descriptive statistical analysis, and the qualitative data was analysed using
Strauss-Corbinian Grounded Theory, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory analysis

emotional challenge, (2) varying emotions that practitioners feel when it is
challenging to handle RCs, (3) how stakeholders, including practitioners
themselves, peers, managers and customers, influence the RC handling and how
practitioners feel due to the stakeholder influence, and (4) practices that can
be used to better handle RCs. Conclusion: Some challenges are technical and
some are social which also belong to aspects of agile practice, emotional

"Statistical correlations of nuclear quadrupole deformations and charge
  radii",2022-05-12T15:04:14Z,"Paul-Gerhard Reinhard, Witek Nazarewicz","Shape deformations and charge radii, basic properties of atomic nuclei, are
influenced by both the global features of the nuclear force and the nucleonic
shell structure. As functions of proton and neutron number, both quantities
show regular patterns and, for nuclei away from magic numbers, they change very
smoothly from nucleus to nucleus. In this paper, we explain how the local shell
effects are impacting the statistical correlations between quadrupole
deformations and charge radii in well-deformed even-even Er, Yb, and Hf
isotopes. This implies, in turn, that sudden changes in correlations can be
useful indicators of underlying shell effects. Our theoretical analysis is
performed in the framework of self-consistent mean-field theory using
quantified energy density functionals and density-dependent pairing forces. The
statistical analysis is carried out by means of the linear least-square
regression. The local variations of nuclear quadrupole deformations and charge
radii, explained in terms of occupations individual deformed Hartree-Fock
orbits, make and imprint on statistical correlations of computed observables.
While the calculated deformations or charge radii are, in some cases,
correlated with those of their even-even neighbors, the correlations seem to
deteriorate rapidly with particle number. The statistical correlations between
nuclear deformations and charge radii of different nuclei are affected by the
underlying shell structure. Even for well deformed and superfluid nuclei for
which these observables change smoothly, the correlation range usually does not
exceed $\Delta N=4$ and $\Delta Z=4$, i.e., it is rather short. This result
suggests that the frequently made assumption of reduced statistical errors for
the differences between smoothly-varying observables cannot be generally
justified.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06139v1

system to be magnetoelectric. One monolayer of Sc2TbN@C80 has been studied on
h-BN/Ni(111). The molecules assume a hexagonally close packed lattice aligned
with the substrate high symmetry directions. The structure is incommensurate
and arranges at a periodicity of about 4.3x4.3 substrate unit cells. At low

band photoemission spectroscopy shows a temperature induced 0.3 eV shift on the

the methods ignore the dynamically changing correlations between road network
nodes that arise as traffic data changes. We propose a neural network-based
Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) to
address the above challenges for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose
an interactive dynamic graph convolution structure, which divides the sequences
at intervals and synchronously captures the traffic data's spatial-temporal

strategy makes STIDGCN effective for long-term prediction. We also propose a
novel dynamic graph convolution module to capture the dynamically changing
correlations in the traffic network, consisting of a graph generator and fusion
graph convolution. The dynamic graph convolution module can use the input
traffic data and pre-defined graph structure to generate a graph structure. It
is then fused with the defined adaptive adjacency matrix to generate a dynamic
adjacency matrix, which fills the pre-defined graph structure and simulates the
generation of dynamic associations between nodes in the road network. Extensive

Subset Node Anomaly Tracking over Large Dynamic Graphs,2022-05-19T18:19:14Z,"Xingzhi Guo, Baojian Zhou, Steven Skiena","Tracking a targeted subset of nodes in an evolving graph is important for
many real-world applications. Existing methods typically focus on identifying
anomalous edges or finding anomaly graph snapshots in a stream way. However,
edge-oriented methods cannot quantify how individual nodes change over time

computationally inefficient.
  This paper proposes \textsc{DynAnom}, an efficient framework to quantify the
changes and localize per-node anomalies over large dynamic weighted-graphs.
Thanks to recent advances in dynamic representation learning based on
Personalized PageRank, \textsc{DynAnom} is 1) \textit{efficient}: the time
complexity is linear to the number of edge events and independent on node size
of the input graph; 2) \textit{effective}: \textsc{DynAnom} can successfully
track topological changes reflecting real-world anomaly; 3) \textit{flexible}:
different type of anomaly score functions can be defined for various
applications. Experiments demonstrate these properties on both benchmark graph
datasets and a new large real-world dynamic graph. Specifically, an
instantiation method based on \textsc{DynAnom} achieves the accuracy of 0.5425

  Optimization",2022-05-20T15:02:53Z,"Javier Del Ser, Alejandro Barredo-Arrieta, Natalia Díaz-Rodríguez, Francisco Herrera, Andreas Holzinger","There is a broad consensus on the importance of deep learning models in tasks
involving complex data. Often, an adequate understanding of these models is
required when focusing on the transparency of decisions in human-critical
applications. Besides other explainability techniques, trustworthiness can be
achieved by using counterfactuals, like the way a human becomes familiar with
an unknown process: by understanding the hypothetical circumstances under which
the output changes. In this work we argue that automated counterfactual
generation should regard several aspects of the produced adversarial instances,
not only their adversarial capability. To this end, we present a novel
framework for the generation of counterfactual examples which formulates its
goal as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing three different
objectives: 1) plausibility, i.e., the likeliness of the counterfactual of
being possible as per the distribution of the input data; 2) intensity of the
changes to the original input; and 3) adversarial power, namely, the
variability of the model's output induced by the counterfactual. The framework
departs from a target model to be audited and uses a Generative Adversarial
Network to model the distribution of input data, together with a
multi-objective solver for the discovery of counterfactuals balancing among
these objectives. The utility of the framework is showcased over six
classification tasks comprising image and three-dimensional data. The
experiments verify that the framework unveils counterfactuals that comply with
intuition, increasing the trustworthiness of the user, and leading to further
insights, such as the detection of bias and data misrepresentation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10232v1
"What's the Harm? Sharp Bounds on the Fraction Negatively Affected by
  Treatment",2022-05-20T17:36:33Z,Nathan Kallus,"The fundamental problem of causal inference -- that we never observe
counterfactuals -- prevents us from identifying how many might be negatively
affected by a proposed intervention. If, in an A/B test, half of users click
(or buy, or watch, or renew, etc.), whether exposed to the standard experience
A or a new one B, hypothetically it could be because the change affects no one,
because the change positively affects half the user population to go from
no-click to click while negatively affecting the other half, or something in
between. While unknowable, this impact is clearly of material importance to the
decision to implement a change or not, whether due to fairness, long-term,
systemic, or operational considerations. We therefore derive the
tightest-possible (i.e., sharp) bounds on the fraction negatively affected (and
other related estimands) given data with only factual observations, whether
experimental or observational. Naturally, the more we can stratify individuals
by observable covariates, the tighter the sharp bounds. Since these bounds
involve unknown functions that must be learned from data, we develop a robust
inference algorithm that is efficient almost regardless of how and how fast
these functions are learned, remains consistent when some are mislearned, and
still gives valid conservative bounds when most are mislearned. Our methodology
altogether therefore strongly supports credible conclusions: it avoids
spuriously point-identifying this unknowable impact, focusing on the best
bounds instead, and it permits exceedingly robust inference on these. We
demonstrate our method in simulation studies and in a case study of career
counseling for the unemployed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10327v2
"Fast Change Identification in Multi-Play Bandits and its Applications in
  Wireless Networks",2022-05-20T05:27:03Z,Gourab Ghatak,"Next-generation wireless services are characterized by a diverse set of
requirements, to sustain which, the wireless access points need to probe the
users in the network periodically. In this regard, we study a novel multi-armed
bandit (MAB) setting that mandates probing all the arms periodically while
keeping track of the best current arm in a non-stationary environment. In
particular, we develop \texttt{TS-GE} that balances the regret guarantees of
classical Thompson sampling (TS) with the broadcast probing (BP) of all the
arms simultaneously in order to actively detect a change in the reward
distributions. The main innovation in the algorithm is in identifying the
changed arm by an optional subroutine called group exploration (GE) that scales
as $\log_2(K)$ for a $K-$armed bandit setting. We characterize the probability
of missed detection and the probability of false-alarm in terms of the
environment parameters. We highlight the conditions in which the regret
guarantee of \texttt{TS-GE} outperforms that of the state-of-the-art
algorithms, in particular, \texttt{ADSWITCH} and \texttt{M-UCB}. We demonstrate
the efficacy of \texttt{TS-GE} by employing it in two wireless system

"Shocks in radiatively driven time dependent, relativistic jets around
  black holes",2022-05-21T04:18:03Z,"Raj Kishor Joshi, Sanjit Debnath, Indranil Chattopadhyay","We study time-dependent relativistic jets under the influence of radiation
field of the accretion disk. The accretion disk consists of an inner compact
corona and an outer sub-Keplerian disk. The thermodynamics of the fluid is
governed by a relativistic equation of state (EoS) for multispecies fluid which
enables to study the effect of composition on jet-dynamics. Jets originate from
the vicinity of the central black hole where the effect of gravity is
significant and traverses large distances where only special relativistic
treatment is sufficient. So we have modified the flat metric to include the
effect of gravity. In this modified relativistic framework we have developed a
new total variation diminishing (TVD) routine along with multispecies EoS for
the purpose. We show that the acceleration of jets crucially depends on flow
composition. All the results presented are transonic in nature, starting from
very low injection velocities, the jets can achieve high Lorentz factors. For
sub-Eddington luminosities, lepton dominated jets can be accelerated to Lorentz
factors > 50. The change in radiation field due to variation in the accretion
disk dynamics will be propagated to the jet in a finite amount of time. Hence
any change in radiation field due to a change in disk configuration will affect
the lower part of the jet before it affects the outer part. This can drive
shock transition in the jet flow. Depending upon the disk oscillation
frequency, amplitude and jet parameters these shocks can collide with each
other and may trigger shock cascades.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10502v1
Co-design of Embodied Neural Intelligence via Constrained Evolution,2022-05-21T22:44:12Z,"Zhiquan Wang, Bedrich Benes, Ahmed H. Qureshi, Christos Mousas","We introduce a novel co-design method for autonomous moving agents' shape
attributes and locomotion by combining deep reinforcement learning and
evolution with user control. Our main inspiration comes from evolution, which
has led to wide variability and adaptation in Nature and has the potential to
significantly improve design and behavior simultaneously. Our method takes an
input agent with optional simple constraints such as leg parts that should not
evolve or allowed ranges of changes. It uses physics-based simulation to
determine its locomotion and finds a behavior policy for the input design,
later used as a baseline for comparison. The agent is then randomly modified
within the allowed ranges creating a new generation of several hundred agents.
The generation is trained by transferring the previous policy, which
significantly speeds up the training. The best-performing agents are selected,
and a new generation is formed using their crossover and mutations. The next
generations are then trained until satisfactory results are reached. We show a
wide variety of evolved agents, and our results show that even with only 10% of
changes, the overall performance of the evolved agents improves 50%. If more
significant changes to the initial design are allowed, our experiments'
performance improves even more to 150%. Contrary to related work, our co-design
works on a single GPU and provides satisfactory results by training thousands
of agents within one hour.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10688v1
A Taxonomy of Schema Changes for NoSQL Databases,2022-05-23T22:51:05Z,"Alberto Hernández Chillón, Meike Klettke, Diego Sevilla Ruiz, Jesús García Molina","Schema evolution is a crucial aspect in database management. The proposed
taxonomies of schema changes have neglected the set of operations that involves
relationships between entity types: aggregation and references, as well as the
possible existence of structural variations for schema types, as most of NoSQL
systems are schemaless. The distinction between entity types and relationship
types, which is typical of graph schemas, is also not taken into account in the
published works. Moreover, NoSQL schema evolution poses the challenge of having
different data models, and no standard specification exists for them. In this
paper, a generic approach for evolving NoSQL and relational schemas is
presented, which is based on the U-Schema unified data model that includes
aggregation and reference relationships, and structural variations. For this
data model, we introduce a taxonomy of schema changes for all the U-Schema
elements, which is implemented by creating the Orion database-independent
language. We will show how Orion can be used to automatically generate
evolution scripts for a set of NoSQL databases, and the feasibility of each
schema operation will be analyzed through the performance results obtained. The
taxonomy has been formally validated by means of Alloy, and two case studies
show the application of Orion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11660v1

charged-rotating-NUT-Kiselev (CRNK) black hole in the Rastall theory of
gravity. By investigating the motion of photons in the CRNK black hole
spacetime in the Rastall gravity we show that the deflection angle of photons
due to the gravitational lensing is mostly influenced by the NUT charge,
parameter of the equation of state for the quintessence and the quintessential
intensity. We observe that the effects of the rest of the spacetime parameters
are negligible on the deflection angle. We present the shape of the shadow cast
by the CRNK black hole in the Rastall gravity for various values of the
spacetime parameters. We demonstrate that spin parameter $a$ of the black hole
changes the position and size of the shadow of the black hole very little.
While changing the values of the rest of the spacetime parameters can alter the
shape and the size of the observed shadow of the black hole significantly. We
observe that the radius of the black hole shadow and the deflection angle of a
photon are bigger for the CRNK black hole in the Rastall gravity, as compared
with the case of the Kerr black hole. Lastly, we show how the spacetime
parameters can change the observables $R_s$ and $\delta_s$, being the average
radius of the shadow and the distortion parameter that measures the deviation
of the shape of the shadow from a perfect circle with radius $R_s$,
respectively. Our results show that in most scenarios, for bigger values of

the diffusion limited aggregation theory, such MoS2 patterns are formed under
the low Mo chemical potential and low temperature with respect to common

significant periods of sea-level change in recent geologic history. During this
period, evaporite deposition throughout the Mediterranean basin records a
series of dramatic environmental changes as flow through the Strait of
Gibraltar was restricted. In the first stage of evaporite deposition, cycles of
gypsum appear in shallow basins on the margins of the Mediterranean. The
complex environmental history giving rise to these cycles has been investigated
for decades but remains controversial. Notably, whether the evaporites are
connected to significant changes in Mediterranean sea-level is an open
question. In one proposed model, competition between tectonic uplift and
erosion at the Strait of Gibraltar gives rise to self-sustaining sea-level
oscillations -- limit cycles -- which trigger evaporite deposition. Here I show
that limit cycles are not a robust result of the proposed model and discuss how
any oscillations produced by this model depend on an unrealistic formulation of
a key model equation. First, I simplify the model equations and test whether
limit cycles are produced in 64 million unique combinations of model
parameters, finding oscillations in only 0.2 % of all simulations. Next, I
examine the formulation of a critical model equation representing stream
channel slope over the Strait of Gibraltar, concluding that a more realistic

These calibrations include recent updates to the Hubble Space Telescope primary
standard white dwarf models and a new reference flux for Vega. Time-dependent
inverse sensitivities for the two WFC3-UVIS chips, UVIS1 and UVIS2, were

cost of the optimal policy of any episode starting from any state, $T_{\star}$

proxy for the importance or influence of that node, and the differences in node
centrality generate hierarchies and inequalities. If the network is evolving in
time, the influence of each node changes in time as well, and the corresponding
hierarchies are modified accordingly. However, there is still a lack of
systematic study into the ways in which the centrality of a node evolves when a
graph changes. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of metrics of equality and
hierarchical mobility in networks that evolve in time. We propose an indicator
of equality based on the classical Gini Coefficient from economics, and we
quantify the hierarchical mobility of nodes, that is, how and to what extent
the centrality of a node and its neighbourhood change over time. These measures
are applied to a corpus of thirty time evolving network data sets from
different domains. We show that the proposed taxonomy measures can discriminate
between networks from different fields. We also investigate correlations
between different taxonomy measures, and demonstrate that some of them have
consistently strong correlations (or anti-correlations) across the entire

dynamics of these US domestic airline networks, comprising 17 airlines, from

analyzing temporal networks, in which the network structure changes over time.
We found that, first, even though the number of nodes and edges returned to

airline network remained altered. We also found that the network dynamics
varied significantly from airline to airline. Full-service carriers were less
flexible in changing their network structure and suffered higher revenue
losses. On the contrary, most regional carriers completely shifted to a new
structure, which may have contributed to reducing their revenue losses.
Low-cost carriers were characterized by more pronounced differences between
airlines and drastically changed their network structure immediately after the

  Selection",2022-05-31T16:21:14Z,"Ryan Boldi, Thomas Helmuth, Lee Spector","Down-sampling training data has long been shown to improve the generalization
performance of a wide range of machine learning systems. Recently,
down-sampling has proved effective in genetic programming (GP) runs that
utilize the lexicase parent selection technique. Although this down-sampling
procedure has been shown to significantly improve performance across a variety
of problems, it does not seem to do so due to encouraging adaptability through
environmental change. We hypothesize that the random sampling that is performed
every generation causes discontinuities that result in the population being
unable to adapt to the shifting environment. We investigate modifications to
down-sampled lexicase selection in hopes of promoting incremental environmental
change to scaffold evolution by reducing the amount of jarring discontinuities
between the environments of successive generations. In our empirical studies,
we find that forcing incremental environmental change is not significantly
better for evolving solutions to program synthesis problems than simple random
down-sampling. In response to this, we attempt to exacerbate the hypothesized
prevalence of discontinuities by using only disjoint down-samples to see if it
hinders performance. We find that this also does not significantly differ from
the performance of regular random down-sampling. These negative results raise
new questions about the ways in which the composition of sub-samples, which may
include synonymous cases, may be expected to influence the performance of

higher than a critical value of $\sim 10^{-3}$. We find that the CLAGNs

evolution of the broad lines should be correlated with the evolution of the
underlying accretion process. We further find that the CLAGNs are consistent

characterized by abrupt transitions of drift direction. As the pulsar does not
exhibit other mode changes or clear nulling, it is an ideal candidate system
for studying the phenomenon of drift direction change. For $\sim 80\%$ of the
time the subpulses are characterized by positive drift - from early to later
longitudes - while the drift direction is negative in the other $\sim 20\%$.
The subpulse separation for single pulses with positive drift, $P_2=(18.8\pm
0.1)^{\circ}$, is higher then for single pulses with negative drift,
$P_2=(17.5\pm 0.2)^{\circ}$. When the drift is stable, the measured repetition
time of the drift pattern is $P_3^{\rm obs}=(43.5 \pm 0.4) P$, where $P$ is
pulsar period. We show that the observed data can be reproduced by a carousel
models with subpulse rotation around the magnetic axis using purely dipolar
configuration of surface magnetic field. The observed drift characteristics can
be modeled assuming that the actual repetition time $P_3<2P$, such that we
observe its aliased value. A small variation in $P_3$, of the order of $6\%$
(or less assuming higher alias orders), is enough to reproduce the
characteristic drift direction changes we observe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02382v1
Dynamics of H atoms surface recombination in low-temperature plasma,2022-06-09T10:11:48Z,"V. Gubarev, D. Lopayev, A. Zotovich, M. A. Blauw, V. Medvedev, P. Krainov, D. Astakhov, S. Zyryanov","The dynamics of H atom recombination on materials of interest for a EUV
lithographer was studied under a longterm low-pressure H2 plasma exposure. The
similarity of the experimental plasma with the typical EUV-induced plasma over
the multi-layer mirrors (MLMs) surface of the EUV lithographic machine is
demonstrated by means of 2D PIC MC simulation. The measurement of the temporal
dynamics of the H atom surface loss probability is chosen for testing the
surface modification during the treatment. Time-resolved actinometry of H atoms
with Kr as the actinometer gas was used to detect the dynamics of the H-atom
loss probability on the surface of Al, Ru, RVS and SiO2. It is demonstrated
that significant changes of the materials surface occur only at the very
beginning of the treatment and ist due to the surface heating and cleaning
effects. After that no changes of the H recombination rate are found,
indicating that the surface stays absolutely stable. A special test of the
sensitivity of the used method to the state of surface was carried out.
Dynamics of the H recombination rate changes with the small O2 addition clearly
demonstrated modification of the Al surface due to oxidation with the next
removal of the oxygen by the H2 plasma treatment. The rate of oxide removal is
shown to be determined by plasma parameters such as the ion energy and flux to
the surface.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04391v1

subject matter experts with years of experience. As a result, changes in
accelerator performance can require time-intensive consultations with experts

detection task for radio-frequency (RF) stations at the Linac Coherent Light
Source (LCLS). The existing RF station diagnostics are bandwidth limited,
resulting in slow, unreliable signals. As a result, anomaly detection is
currently a manual process. We propose a beam-based method, identifying changes
in the accelerator status using shot-to-shot data from the beam position
monitoring system; by comparing the beam-based anomalies to data from RF
stations, we identify the source of the change. We find that our proposed
method can be fully automated while identifying more events with fewer false
positives than the RF station diagnostics alone. Our automated fault
identification system has been used to create a new data set for investigating
the interaction between the RF stations and accelerator performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04626v2
"On Low-Complexity Quickest Intervention of Mutated Diffusion Processes
  Through Local Approximation",2022-06-09T19:14:32Z,"Qining Zhang, Honghao Wei, Weina Wang, Lei Ying","We consider the problem of controlling a mutated diffusion process with an
unknown mutation time. The problem is formulated as the quickest intervention
problem with the mutation modeled by a change-point, which is a generalization
of the quickest change-point detection (QCD). Our goal is to intervene in the
mutated process as soon as possible while maintaining a low intervention cost
with optimally chosen intervention actions. This model and the proposed
algorithms can be applied to pandemic prevention (such as Covid-19) or
misinformation containment. We formulate the problem as a partially observed
Markov decision process (POMDP) and convert it to an MDP through the belief
state of the change-point. We first propose a grid approximation approach to
calculate the optimal intervention policy, whose computational complexity could
be very high when the number of grids is large. In order to reduce the
computational complexity, we further propose a low-complexity threshold-based
policy through the analysis of the first-order approximation of the value
functions in the ``local intervention'' regime. Simulation results show the
low-complexity algorithm has a similar performance as the grid approximation
and both perform much better than the QCD-based algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04733v1
"Hamilton's Principle with Phase Changes and Conservation Principles for
  Moist Potential Vorticity",2022-06-15T18:03:35Z,"Parvathi Kooloth, Leslie M. Smith, Samuel N. Stechmann","Many definitions of moist potential vorticity (PV) have been proposed to
extend the dry theory of Ertel PV. None of the moist PV definitions seem to
have all of the desirable properties of the dry Ertel PV. For instance, dry PV
is not only a globally conserved quantity, but also a material invariant that
is conserved along fluid parcel trajectories. Therefore, an open question
remains: is there a moist PV that is a material invariant, if clouds and phase
changes of water are present? In prior studies, definitions of moist PV have
been proposed based on physical and mathematical intuition. Here, a systematic
approach is used. In particular, a particle relabeling symmetry is devised for
a moist atmosphere and then Noether's theorem is employed to arrive at the
associated conservation laws for moist PV. A priori, it is not clear whether
this systematic approach will be viable, since it relies on variational
derivatives in Hamilton's principle, and phase changes introduce singularities
that could potentially prevent derivatives at cloud edge. However, it is shown
that the energy and the Lagrangian density are sufficiently smooth to allow
variational derivatives, in a moist Boussinesq system with reversible phase
transitions between water vapor and liquid cloud water.. From the particle
relabeling symmetry, a moist Kelvin circulation theorem is found, along with a
moist PV conservation law that applies not for each individual parcel but for
parcel-integrated PV, integrated over certain local volumes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07734v1
How cooling influences circumbinary discs,2022-06-15T18:22:33Z,"Prakruti Sudarshan, Anna B. T. Penzlin, Alexandros Ziampras, Wilhelm Kley, Richard P. Nelson","Circumbinary disc observations and simulations show large, eccentric inner
cavities. Recent work has shown that the shape and size of these cavities
depend on the aspect ratio and viscosity of the disc, as well as the binary
eccentricity and mass ratio. It has been further shown that, for gaps created
by planets, the cooling timescale significantly affects the shape and size of
the gap. In this study, we consider the effect of different cooling models on
the cavity shape in a circumbinary disc. We compare locally isothermal and
radiatively cooled disc models to ones with a parametrised cooling timescale
($\beta$-cooling), implemented in 2D numerical simulations for varying binary
eccentricities. While the shape of the cavity for radiative and locally
isothermal models remains comparable, the inner disc structure changes
slightly, leading to a change in the precession rate of the disc. With
$\beta$-cooled models, the shape and size of the cavity changes dramatically
towards values of $\beta$=1. Based on our findings, we introduce a parametrised
$\beta$ model that accounts for the shorter cooling timescale inside the cavity
while adequately reproducing the results of the radiative model, and we
highlight that accurate treatment of the thermodynamics inside the cavity has a
significant impact in modelling circumbinary systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07749v1
"Determining Undersampled Coastal Tidal Harmonics using Regularized Least
  Squares",2022-06-15T21:26:04Z,"Ruo-Qian Wang, Behzad Golparvar, Morgan Mark","Satellite altimetry, which measures water level with global coverage and high
resolution, provides an unprecedented opportunity for a wide and refined
understanding of the changing tides in the coastal area, but the sampling
frequency is too low to satisfy the Nyquist frequency requirement and too few
data points per year are available to recognize a sufficient number of tidal
constituents to capture the trend of tidal changes on a yearly basis. To
address these issues, a novel Regularized Least-Square approach is developed to
relax the limitation to the range of satellite operating conditions. In this
method, the prior information of the regional tidal amplitudes is used to
support a least square analysis to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the
tidal constituents for water elevation time series of different lengths and
time intervals. Synthetic data experiments performed in Delaware Bay and
Galveston Bay showed that the proposed method can determine the tidal
amplitudes with high accuracy and the sampling interval can be extended to the
application level of major altimetry satellites. The proposed algorithm was
further validated using the data of the altimetry mission, Jason-3, to show its
applicability to irregular and noisy data. The new method could help identify
the changing tides with sea-level rise and anthropogenic activities in coastal
areas, informing coastal flooding risk assessment and ecosystem health

  August 17 M3.3 Flare",2022-06-18T09:25:26Z,"Yanjie Zhang, Zhe Xu, Qingmin Zhang, Jun Dai, Haisheng Ji","In this Letter, we give a detailed analysis to the M3.3 class flare that
occurred on August 17, 2013 (SOL2013-08-17T18:16). It presents a clear picture
of mutual magnetic interaction initially from the photosphere to the corona via
the abrupt rapid shearing motion of a small sunspot before the flare, and then
suddenly from the corona back to the photosphere via the sudden retraction
motion of the same sunspot during the flare impulsive phase. About 10 hours
before the flare, a small sunspot in the active region NOAA 11818 started to
move northeast along a magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), creating a
shearing motion that changed the quasi-static state of the active region. A
filament right above the PIL was activated following the movement of the
sunspot and then got partially erupted. The eruption eventually led to the M3.3
flare. The sunspot was then suddenly pulled back to the opposite direction upon
the flare onset. During the backward motion, the Lorentz force underwent a
simultaneous impulsive change both in magnitude and direction. Its directional
change is found to be conformable with the retraction motion. The observation
provides direct evidence for the role of the shearing motion of the sunspot in
powering and triggering the flare. It especially confirms that the abrupt
motion of a sunspot during a solar flare is the result of a back reaction
caused by the reconfiguration of the coronal magnetic field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09156v1

  BZ-jet and inner-disk coupling",2022-06-19T15:42:17Z,"Ning Chang, Xiang Liu, Fu-Guo Xie, Lang Cui, Hao Shan","In this paper, we investigate the black hole (BH) spin contribution to jet
power, especially for the magnetic arrested disk (MAD), where only inner
accretion disk luminosity is closely coupled with the spin-jet power, and try
to explain the `outliers' track of the radio $L_{\rm R}$ to X-ray luminosity
$L_{\rm X}$ in two black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs). Our results suggest that
the BZ-jet and the inner-disk coupling could account for the `outliers' track
of the radio/X-ray correlation in two BHXBs, H1743-322 and MAXI J1348-630.
Although the accretion disk of H1743-322 in the outburst could be in the MAD
state, there is a lower probability that MAXI J1348-630 is in the MAD state due
to its low jet production efficiency. The difference in the inner-disk
bolometric luminosity ratio of the two sources implies that these two BHXBs are
in different inner-disk accretion states. We further investigate the
phase-changing regime of MAXI J1348-630 and find that there is a phase
transition around $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 10^{-3}$. The assumption of
sub-MAD is discussed as well.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09434v2

  Reinforcement Learning",2022-06-19T22:32:41Z,"Se-Wook Yoo, Seung-Woo Seo","Many robotic tasks are composed of a lot of temporally correlated sub-tasks
in a highly complex environment. It is important to discover situational
intentions and proper actions by deliberating on temporal abstractions to solve
problems effectively. To understand the intention separated from changing task
dynamics, we extend an empowerment-based regularization technique to situations
with multiple tasks based on the framework of a generative adversarial network.
Under the multitask environments with unknown dynamics, we focus on learning a
reward and policy from the unlabeled expert examples. In this study, we define
situational empowerment as the maximum of mutual information representing how
an action conditioned on both a certain state and sub-task affects the future.
Our proposed method derives the variational lower bound of the situational
mutual information to optimize it. We simultaneously learn the transferable
multi-task reward function and policy by adding an induced term to the
objective function. By doing so, the multi-task reward function helps to learn
a robust policy for environmental change. We validate the advantages of our
approach on multi-task learning and multi-task transfer learning. We
demonstrate our proposed method has the robustness of both randomness and

Inference-Based Quantum Sensing,2022-06-20T17:58:19Z,"C. Huerta Alderete, Max Hunter Gordon, Frederic Sauvage, Akira Sone, Andrew T. Sornborger, Patrick J. Coles, M. Cerezo","In a standard Quantum Sensing (QS) task one aims at estimating an unknown
parameter $\theta$, encoded into an $n$-qubit probe state, via measurements of
the system. The success of this task hinges on the ability to correlate changes
in the parameter to changes in the system response $\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ (i.e.,
changes in the measurement outcomes). For simple cases the form of
$\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ is known, but the same cannot be said for realistic
scenarios, as no general closed-form expression exists. In this work we present
an inference-based scheme for QS. We show that, for a general class of unitary
families of encoding, $\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ can be fully characterized by only
measuring the system response at $2n+1$ parameters. This allows us to infer the
value of an unknown parameter given the measured response, as well as to
determine the sensitivity of the scheme, which characterizes its overall
performance. We show that inference error is, with high probability, smaller
than $\delta$, if one measures the system response with a number of shots that
scales only as $\Omega(\log^3(n)/\delta^2)$. Furthermore, the framework
presented can be broadly applied as it remains valid for arbitrary probe states
and measurement schemes, and, even holds in the presence of quantum noise. We
also discuss how to extend our results beyond unitary families. Finally, to
showcase our method we implement it for a QS task on real quantum hardware, and
in numerical simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09919v2

benchmarks with sufficient diversity to evaluate whether LLMs have innate

community, especially in the International Planning Competition, to test the
capabilities of LLMs in planning or reasoning about actions and change.
PlanBench provides sufficient diversity in both the task domains and the

Marginal Interventional Effects,2022-06-21T20:34:01Z,"Xiang Zhou, Aleksei Opacic","Conventional causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE),
reflect how the mean outcome in a population or subpopulation would change if
all units received treatment versus control. Real-world policy changes,
however, are often incremental, changing the treatment status for only a small
segment of the population who are at or near ""the margin of participation."" To
capture this notion, two parallel lines of inquiry have developed in economics
and in statistics and epidemiology that define, identify, and estimate what we
call interventional effects. In this article, we bridge these two strands of
literature by defining interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a
treatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and marginal interventional
effect (MIE) as its limit when the size of the intervention approaches zero.
The IE and MIE can be viewed as the unconditional counterparts of the
policy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) proposed in
the economics literature. However, different from PRTE and MPRTE, IE and MIE
are defined without reference to a latent index model, and, as we show, can be
identified either under unconfoundedness or through the use of instrumental
variables. For both scenarios, we show that MIEs are typically identified
without the strong positivity assumption required of the ATE, highlight several
""stylized interventions"" that may be of particular interest in policy analysis,
discuss several parametric and semiparametric estimation strategies, and
illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10717v1

  Condensate",2022-06-23T15:42:02Z,"Vladislav Yu. Shishkov, Evgeny S. Andrianov","An ideal equilibrium Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is usually considered in
the grand canonical ($\mu V T$) ensemble, which implies the presence of the
chemical equilibrium with the environment. However, in most experimental
scenarios, the total amount of particles in BEC is determined either by the
initial conditions or by the balance between dissipation and pumping. As a
result, BEC may possess the thermal equilibrium but almost never the chemical
equilibrium. In addition, many experimentally achievable BECs are non-ideal due
to interaction between particles. In the recent work
[10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.065301], it has been shown that invariant subspaces in
the system Hilbert space appear in non-equilibrium BEC in the fast
thermalization limit. In each of these subspaces, Gibbs distribution is
established with a certain number of particles that makes it possible to
investigate properties of non-ideal non-equilibrium BEC independently in each
invariant subspace. In this work, we analyze the BEC stability due to change in
dispersion curve caused by non-ideal interactions in BEC. Generally, non-ideal
interactions lead to the redshift or blueshift of the dispertion curve and to
the change in the effective mass of the particles. We show that the redshift of
the dispersion curve can lead to the negative compressibility of BEC, whereas
the change in the effective mass always makes BEC more stable. We find the
explicit condition for the particle density in BEC, at which the negative
compressibility appears.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11785v1
"Continual Learning of Dynamical Systems with Competitive Federated
  Reservoir Computing",2022-06-27T14:35:50Z,"Leonard Bereska, Efstratios Gavves","Machine learning recently proved efficient in learning differential equations
and dynamical systems from data. However, the data is commonly assumed to
originate from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling
real-world dynamical processes, the data distribution often shifts due to
changes in the underlying system dynamics. Continual learning of these
processes aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt system changes without forgetting
previous dynamical regimes. This work proposes an approach to continual
learning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art method for training
recurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems.
Reservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot be
forgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose
to train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by
neuroscience's predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate,
laterally inhibiting and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting
induced by interfering parameter updates. We show that this multi-head
reservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic forgetting on several
dynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the chaotic Lorenz
attractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our results
suggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for the
continual learning of dynamical systems. We provide our code for data

beneficial. These conclusions are tentative, and our results show a sensitivity

Current methods of parameter estimation do not include all physical effects of
eccentric systems such as spin-induced precession, higher-order modes, and the
initial argument of periapsis: an angle describing the orientation of the
orbital ellipse. We explore how varying the argument of periapsis changes
gravitational waveforms and study its effect on the inference of astrophysical
parameters. We use the eccentric spin-aligned waveforms TEOBResumS and SEOBNRE
to measure the change in the waveforms as the argument of periapsis is changed.
We find that the argument of periapsis could already be impacting analyses
performed with TEOBResumS. However, it is likely to be well-resolvable in the

at examining possible realizations of this idea at the level of quantum

questions: Does the Hartle - Hawking wave function imply such a realization?
How can this idea be realized in the extended phase space approach to quantum
gravity, where the change of signature is described by imposing special

generated by oxygen-reactive chemotactic bacteria. This study investigated the
bioconvection patterns, interference between plumes, and the wavelength of
bioconvection patterns. In addition, we clarified the transport characteristics
of cells and oxygen in the bioconvection. Multiple plumes occur in the
suspension and three-dimensional bioconvection is formed around the plumes by
the cells with vortex rings arising around the plumes. Even if bioconvection at
a high Rayleigh number is disturbed, the bioconvection is strongly stable with
respect to disturbances, and the pattern does not change due to disturbances.
Bioconvection changes depending on the physical properties of bacteria and
oxygen, and, in particular, the rate of oxygen consumption by bacteria
significantly affects the strength of bioconvection. Bioconvection patterns
with different plume arrangements and shapes are formed for different Rayleigh
numbers or initial disturbances of the cell concentration. As a result, the
wavelengths of the patterns also vary. As the Rayleigh number increases,
interference between plumes is strengthened by the shortening of the pattern
wavelength, so the velocities of both upward and downward flows increase. Many
cells are located under the plumes and a strong shear flow occurs in these
regions. As the pattern wavelength decreases, the cells are affected by high
shear stress. Then, the convective transport of the entire suspension
strengthens and the transport characteristics of cells and oxygen improve. When
the chamber boundary is changed to side walls, bacteria adhere to the wall
surface, and plumes are regularly arranged along the side walls.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02909v2

modeling of the extremal dependence shown by the spatial data. This extremal
dependence stems from the geometrical characteristics of the observed rainfall,
which is associated with different meteorological processes and is usually
considered to be constant when designing the model for a study. However,
depending on the region, this dependence can change throughout the year, as the
prevailing meteorological conditions that drive the rainfall generation process
change with the season. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of the
seasonal change in extremal dependence for the modeling of annual block maxima
in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. For this study, two seasons were considered
as proxies for different dominant meteorological conditions: summer for
convective rainfall and winter for frontal/stratiform rainfall. Using maxima
from both seasons, we compared the skill of a linear model with spatial
covariates (that assumed spatial independence) with the skill of a
Brown-Resnick max-stable model. This comparison showed a considerable
difference between seasons, with the isotropic Brown-Resnick model showing
considerable loss of skill for the winter maxima. We conclude that the
assumptions commonly made when using the Brown-Resnick model are appropriate
for modeling summer (i.e., convective) events, but further work should be done
for modeling other types of precipitation regimes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03993v2
"Raman spectroscopic analysis of highly-concentrated antibodies under the
  acid-treated conditions",2022-07-13T23:37:20Z,"Yusui Sato, Satoru Nagatoishi, Shintaro Noguchi, Kouhei Tsumoto","Antibody drugs are usually formulated as highly-concentrated solutions, which
would easily generate oligomer and aggregation, resulting in loss of efficacy.
Although low pH increases the colloidal dispersion of antibodies, acid
denaturation can be an issue. Therefore, knowing the physical properties of
antibodies at low pH under high concentration conditions is an important
insight into the quality evaluation of high concentration antibodies. Raman
spectroscopy is a powerful tool to obtain conformational information derived
from amino acid residues and secondary structures without dilution. In this
study, Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate pH-induced conformational
changes of antibodies at high concentrations. Raman experiments in pH 3 to 7
were performed for human serum IgG and recombinant rituximab. We detected the
evident changes at pH 3 in Tyr and Trp Raman bands, which are the sensitive
markers of intermolecular interactions. Thermal transition analysis over the pH
range demonstrated that the transition temperature (aggregation temperature,
Tagg) was highest at pH 3. Acid-treated and neutralized one showed higher Tagg
than that of pH 7, indicating that acid-induced conformational changes were not
completely reversible. Colloidal analyses confirmed the findings of the Raman
analysis, validating Raman spectroscopy as a method for evaluating antibody
conformation associated with colloidal information.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06556v1

of using this impedance detuning to detect in which segment of the
gastrointestinal tract - stomach, small intestine, or large intestine - the
capsule is located. Meandered dipole antennas operating in the 433 MHz
Industrial, Scientific, and Medical Band are designed for this purpose. The
antennas conform to the inner surface of 3D-printed polylactic-acid capsules

optimized numerically in a homogeneous cylindrical phantom with time-averaged
electromagnetic properties. The magnitude and the phase of the reflection
coefficient are then obtained in different tissues and compared with
simulations and measurements. The experimental demonstration is carried out
first using tissue-mimicking liquids and then in a recently deceased ex vivo
porcine model. The minimum change in the phase between different
gastrointestinal tissues was determined to be around 10 degrees in the porcine

influences the polarization phase curve at small phase angles for different
mineralogies relevant for asteroids, and to determine how different aggregate
sizes affect the negative polarization. We prepared a set of binary and ternary
mixtures with different common minerals on asteroids and one set of the same
mixture with different aggregate sizes. We measured their reflected light at
530 nm with full Stokes polarimetry at phase angles ranging from 0.8{\deg} to
30{\deg}. The mixing effect of the mixtures with both bright and dark minerals
significantly changes the behavior of the phase curves in terms of minimum
polarization, phase angle of the minimum, and inversion angle with respect to
the mineral components that are mixed together. The changes in phase curve
could explain the polarization observation of particular classes of asteroids

Large-scale anisotropies of extragalactic cosmic rays below the ankle,2022-07-23T15:15:41Z,"Silvia Mollerach, Esteban Roulet, Oscar Taborda","We study the anisotropies on large angular scales which can be present in the
flux of cosmic rays reaching the Earth from a population of extragalactic
sources, focusing on the energy range between the second knee and the ankle. In
this energy range the particles are significantly affected by the Galactic
magnetic field, which then plays a relevant role in shaping the expected
anisotropies. The Galactic magnetic field deflects the cosmic-ray trajectories
and thus modifies the anisotropies present outside the halo of the Galaxy, in
particular the dipolar one associated with the translational motion of the
observer (Compton-Getting effect). Also, due to the Galactic rotation, in the
reference frame of an observer at Earth there is an electric component of the
Galactic field that produces a small change in the particles' momentum. This
acceleration depends on the cosmic-ray arrival direction and it hence induces
anisotropies in the flux observed in a given energy range. We analyse the
expected amplitude and phase of the resulting dipolar component of the flux and
discuss the possibility to explain via these effects the change in the phase of
the right-ascension distribution which is observed at energies around 1 EeV.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11540v2
Multi-Scale Asset Distribution Model for Dynamic Environments,2022-07-25T11:14:49Z,"Payam Zahadat, Ada Diaconescu","In many self-organising systems the ability to extract necessary resources
from the external environment is essential to the system's growth and survival.
Examples include the extraction of sunlight and nutrients in organic plants, of
monetary income in business organisations and of mobile robots in swarm
intelligence actions. When operating within competitive, ever-changing
environments, such systems must distribute their internal assets wisely so as
to improve and adapt their ability to extract available resources. As the
system size increases, the asset-distribution process often gets organised
around a multi-scale control topology. This topology may be static (fixed) or
dynamic (enabling growth and structural adaptation) depending on the system's
internal constraints and adaptive mechanisms. In this paper, we expand on a
plant-inspired asset-distribution model and introduce a more general
multi-scale model applicable across a wider range of natural and artificial
system domains. We study the impact that the topology of the multi-scale
control process has upon the system's ability to self-adapt asset distribution
when resource availability changes within the environment. Results show how
different topological characteristics and different competition levels between
system branches impact overall system profitability, adaptation delays and
disturbances when environmental changes occur. These findings provide a basis

"Exploring the Link between the X-ray Power Spectra and Energy Spectra of
  Active Galactic Nuclei",2022-07-25T12:53:32Z,"Haonan Yang, Chichuan Jin, Weimin Yuan","Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are generally considered as the scaled-up
counterparts of X-ray binaries (XRBs). It is known that the power spectral
density (PSD) of the X-ray emission of XRBs shows significant evolution with
spectral states. It is not clear whether AGN follow a similar evolutionary
trend, however, though their X-ray emission and the PSD are both variable. In
this work, we study a sample of nine AGN with multiple long observations with
XMM-Newton, which exhibit significant X-ray spectral variation. We perform
Bayesian PSD analysis to measure the PSD shape and variation. We find that a
large change in the X-ray energy spectrum (mainly the change of flux state) is
often accompanied by a large change in the PSD shape. The emergence of a
high-frequency break in the PSD also depends on the spectral state. Among the
four sources with significant high-frequency PSD breaks detected, three show
the break only in the high-flux state, while the remaining one shows it only in
the low-flux state. Moreover, the X-ray rms variability in different spectral
states of an AGN is found to vary by as much as 1.0 dex. These results suggest
that the different variability properties observed are likely caused by
different physical processes dominating different spectral states. Our results
also indicate that the intrinsic PSD variation can introduce a significant
fraction of the dispersion as reported for the correlations between various
X-ray variability properties and the black hole mass.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12151v1

Structured input-output analysis of stably stratified plane Couette flow,2022-07-26T02:07:23Z,"Chang Liu, Colm-cille P. Caulfield, Dennice F. Gayme","We employ a recently introduced structured input-output analysis (SIOA)
approach to analyze streamwise and spanwise wavelengths of flow structures in
stably stratified plane Couette flow. In the low-Reynolds number ($Re$)
low-bulk Richardson number ($Ri_b$) spatially intermittent regime, we
demonstrate that SIOA predicts high amplification associated with wavelengths
corresponding to the characteristic oblique turbulent bands in this regime.
SIOA also identifies quasi-horizontal flow structures resembling the
turbulent-laminar layers commonly observed in the high-$Re$ high-$Ri_b$
intermittent regime. An SIOA across a range of $Ri_b$ and $Re$ values suggests
that the classical Miles-Howard stability criterion ($Ri_b\leq 1/4$) is
associated with a change in the most amplified flow structures when Prandtl
number is close to one ($Pr\approx 1$). However, for $Pr\ll 1$, the most
amplified flow structures are determined by the product $PrRi_b$. For $Pr\gg
1$, SIOA identifies another quasi-horizontal flow structure that we show is
principally associated with density perturbations. We further demonstrate the
dominance of this density-associated flow structure in the high $Pr$ limit by
constructing analytical scaling arguments for the amplification in terms of
$Re$ and $Pr$ under the assumptions of unstratified flow (with $Ri_b=0$) and

biogeochemistry, sophisticated models of life-environment coupled systems
demonstrate that many assumptions specific to Earth-based life, e.g. specific
ATP maintenance costs, are unnecessary to accurately model a biosphere. We
explore a simple model of a single-species microbial biosphere that produces
CH4 as a byproduct of the microbes' energy extraction - known as a type I
biosignature. We demonstrate that although significantly changing the
biological parameters has a large impact on the biosphere's total population,
such changes have only a minimal impact on the strength of the resulting
biosignature, while the biosphere is limited by H2 availability. We extend the
model to include more accurate microbial energy harvesting and show that
adjusting microbe parameters can lead to a regime change where the biosphere
becomes limited by energy availability and no longer fully exploits the
available H2, impacting the strength of the resulting biosignature. We
demonstrate that, for a nutrient limited biosphere, identifying the limiting
nutrient, understanding the abiotic processes that control its abundance, and
determining the biosphere's ability to exploit it, are more fundamental for
making type I biosignature predictions than the details of the population

constraining angular momentum evolution during the late stages of stellar
evolution, as well as insight into the physics and remnants of double
degenerate mergers. Although the rotational distribution of low mass white
dwarfs is relatively well constrained via asteroseismology, that of high mass
white dwarfs, which can arise from either intermediate mass stellar evolution
or white dwarf mergers, is not. Photometric variability in white dwarfs due to
rotation of a spotted star is rapidly increasing the sample size of high mass
white dwarfs with measured rotation periods. We present the discovery of 22.4
minute photometric variability in the lightcurve of EGGR 156, a strongly
magnetic, ultramassive white dwarf. We interpret this variability as rapid
rotation, and our data suggest that EGGR 156 is the remnant of a double
degenerate merger. Finally, we calculate the rate of period change in rapidly
rotating, massive, magnetic WDs due to magnetic dipole radiation. In many
cases, including EGGR 156, the period change is not currently detectable over
reasonable timescales, indicating that these WDs could be very precise clocks.
For the most highly magnetic, rapidly rotating massive WDs, such as ZTF

The classical cosmological constant of open-closed string field theory,2022-07-31T10:13:47Z,"Carlo Maccaferri, Jakub Vošmera","We consider deformations of D-brane systems induced by a change in the closed
string background in the framework of bosonic open-closed string field theory,
where it is possible to unambiguously tame infrared divergences originating
from both open and closed string degenerations. A closed string classical
solution induces a tadpole for the open strings which shifts the open string
vacuum and generates a cosmological constant composed of two terms: one which
is directly related to the closed string solution and the other which depends
on the open string vacuum shift. We show that only the sum of these two terms
is invariant under closed SFT gauge transformations and therefore is an
observable. We conjecture that this observable is universally proportional to
the shift in the world-sheet disk partition function between the starting
D-brane in undeformed background and the final D-brane in deformed background,

the conjecture by considering a perturbative closed string solution describing
deformations of a Narain compactification and, from the SFT cosmological

building detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings.
This is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's
performance because of presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we
propose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster

this end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another
advantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can
better maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders

Small changes at single nodes can shift global network dynamics,2022-08-03T19:46:14Z,"Kalel L. Rossi, Roberto C. Budzinski, Bruno R. R. Boaretto, Lyle E. Muller, Ulrike Feudel","Understanding the sensitivity of a system's behavior with respect to
parameter changes is essential for many applications. This sensitivity may be
desired - for instance in the brain, where a large repertoire of different
dynamics, particularly different synchronization patterns, is crucial - or may
be undesired - for instance in power grids, where disruptions to
synchronization may lead to blackouts. In this work, we show that the dynamics
of networks of phase oscillators can acquire a very large and complex
sensitivity to changes made in either their units' parameters or in their
connections - even modifications made to a parameter of a single unit can
radically alter the global dynamics of the network in an unpredictable manner.
As a consequence, each modification leads to a different path to phase
synchronization manifested as large fluctuations along that path. This
dynamical malleability occurs over a wide parameter region, around the
network's two transitions to phase synchronization. One transition is induced
by increasing the coupling strength between the units, and another is induced
by increasing the prevalence of long-range connections. Specifically, we study
Kuramoto phase oscillators connected under either Watts-Strogatz or
distance-dependent topologies to analyze the statistical properties of the
fluctuations along the paths to phase synchrony. We argue that this increase in
the dynamical malleability is a general phenomenon, as suggested by both

Adversarial robustness of VAEs through the lens of local geometry,2022-08-08T05:53:57Z,"Asif Khan, Amos Storkey","In an unsupervised attack on variational autoencoders (VAEs), an adversary
finds a small perturbation in an input sample that significantly changes its
latent space encoding, thereby compromising the reconstruction for a fixed
decoder. A known reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent
space resulting from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a
prior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in an input sample can move
its encoding to a low/zero density region in the latent space resulting in an
unconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates that an optimal way for an
adversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional bias of a stochastic
pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks. The
pullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal
latent volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens
to analyse the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space
distortions. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of
a pullback metric tensor. Moreover, we empirically show that the scores
correlate with the robustness parameter $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE. Since
increasing $\beta$ also degrades reconstruction quality, we demonstrate a
simple alternative using \textit{mixup} training to fill the empty regions in
the latent space, thus improving robustness with improved reconstruction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03923v3

horizon telescope (EHT) at the heart of the $M87$ galaxy. After the discovery
of this mysterious object, scientists paid attention to exploring the BH shadow
features under different gravitational backgrounds. In this scenario, we study
the light rings and observational properties of BH shadow surrounded by
different accretion flow models and then investigate the effect of model
parameters on the observational display and space-time structure of BHs in the
framework of our considering system. Under the incompatible configuration of
the emission profiles, the images of BHs comprise that the observed luminosity
is mainly determined by direct emission, while the lensing ring will provide a
small contribution of the total observed flux and the photon ring makes a
negligible contribution due to its exponential narrowness. More importantly,
the observed regions and specific intensities of all emission profiles are
changed correspondingly under variations of parameters. For optically thin
accreting matters, we analyze the profile and specific intensity of the shadows
with static and infalling accretions models, respectively. We find that with an
infalling motion the interior region of the shadows will be darker than in a
static case, due to the Doppler effect of the infalling movement. Finally, it
is concluded that these findings support that the change of BH state parameters
will change the way of space-time geometry, thus affecting the BH shadows

"Improving quantum measurements by introducing ""ghost"" Pauli products",2022-08-13T03:51:38Z,"Seonghoon Choi, Tzu-Ching Yen, Artur F. Izmaylov","Reducing the number of measurements required to estimate the expectation
value of an observable is crucial for the variational quantum eigensolver to
become competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms. To measure
complicated observables such as a molecular electronic Hamiltonian, one of the
common strategies is to partition the observable into linear combinations
(fragments) of mutually commutative Pauli products. The total number of
measurements for obtaining the expectation value is then proportional to the
sum of variances of individual fragments. We propose a method that lowers
individual fragment variances by modifying the fragments without changing the
total observable expectation value. Our approach is based on adding Pauli
products (""ghosts"") that are compatible with members of multiple fragments. The
total expectation value does not change because a sum of coefficients for each
""ghost"" Pauli product introduced to several fragments is zero. Yet, these
additions change individual fragment variances because of the non-vanishing
contributions of ""ghost"" Pauli products within each fragment. The proposed
algorithm minimizes individual fragment variances using a classically efficient
approximation of the quantum wavefunction for variance estimations. Numerical
tests on a few molecular electronic Hamiltonian expectation values show
several-fold reductions in the number of measurements in the ""ghost"" Pauli
algorithm compared to those in the other recently developed techniques.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06563v2
"Reliable Decision from Multiple Subtasks through Threshold Optimization:
  Content Moderation in the Wild",2022-08-16T03:51:43Z,"Donghyun Son, Byounggyu Lew, Kwanghee Choi, Yongsu Baek, Seungwoo Choi, Beomjun Shin, Sungjoo Ha, Buru Chang","Social media platforms struggle to protect users from harmful content through
content moderation. These platforms have recently leveraged machine learning
models to cope with the vast amount of user-generated content daily. Since
moderation policies vary depending on countries and types of products, it is
common to train and deploy the models per policy. However, this approach is
highly inefficient, especially when the policies change, requiring dataset
re-labeling and model re-training on the shifted data distribution. To
alleviate this cost inefficiency, social media platforms often employ
third-party content moderation services that provide prediction scores of
multiple subtasks, such as predicting the existence of underage personnel, rude
gestures, or weapons, instead of directly providing final moderation decisions.
However, making a reliable automated moderation decision from the prediction
scores of the multiple subtasks for a specific target policy has not been
widely explored yet. In this study, we formulate real-world scenarios of
content moderation and introduce a simple yet effective threshold optimization
method that searches the optimal thresholds of the multiple subtasks to make a
reliable moderation decision in a cost-effective way. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach shows better performance in content moderation
compared to existing threshold optimization methods and heuristics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07522v5
A Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Adaptive Charging Policy for WRSNs,2022-08-16T16:10:52Z,"Ngoc Bui, Phi Le Nguyen, Viet Anh Nguyen, Phan Thuan Do","Wireless sensor networks consist of randomly distributed sensor nodes for
monitoring targets or areas of interest. Maintaining the network for continuous
surveillance is a challenge due to the limited battery capacity in each sensor.
Wireless power transfer technology is emerging as a reliable solution for
energizing the sensors by deploying a mobile charger (MC) to recharge the
sensor. However, designing an optimal charging path for the MC is challenging
because of uncertainties arising in the networks. The energy consumption rate
of the sensors may fluctuate significantly due to unpredictable changes in the
network topology, such as node failures. These changes also lead to shifts in
the importance of each sensor, which are often assumed to be the same in
existing works. We address these challenges in this paper by proposing a novel
adaptive charging scheme using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach.
Specifically, we endow the MC with a charging policy that determines the next
sensor to charge conditioning on the current state of the network. We then use
a deep neural network to parametrize this charging policy, which will be
trained by reinforcement learning techniques. Our model can adapt to
spontaneous changes in the network topology. The empirical results show that

"Gender Bias and Universal Substitution Adversarial Attacks on
  Grammatical Error Correction Systems for Automated Assessment",2022-08-19T17:44:13Z,"Vyas Raina, Mark Gales","Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems perform a sequence-to-sequence
task, where an input word sequence containing grammatical errors, is corrected
for these errors by the GEC system to output a grammatically correct word
sequence. With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have
become increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech
transcriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these
powerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a
candidate's fluency. The count of \textit{edits} from a candidate's input
sentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence
is indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest
better fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \textit{fluency
score} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning
based GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to
adversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the
input of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When
considering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment,
the aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a
grammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC
system, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a
perfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution
adversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically
employ to deceive GEC systems used for assessment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09466v1

of the numerical solution to the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and the
analytical solution to the Fermi-Eyges equation. Moreover, a corresponding
adjoint system was derived and solved for the adjoint flux. The proton
phase-space density together with the adjoint flux and the metric (chosen as
the energy deposited by the beam in a variable region of interest) allowed
assessing the accuracy of our algorithm to different perturbation ranges in the

narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy UGC 11763. UGC 11763 shows very different soft
X-ray spectral shapes in the two observations separated by 12 years. Three
spectral models are considered to explain the multi-epoch X-ray variability of
UGC 11763, one based on the relativistic disc reflection model, one based on
multiple partially-covering absorbers combined with the warm corona model, and
a hybrid model. In the first model, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is
caused by the emission from a compact coronal region with a variable size. The
resulting disc reflection component changes accordingly. A warm absorption
model with a modest column density is required in this model too. In the
partially-covering absorption scenario, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is
caused by the variable covering factors of two absorbers located within a
region of $r<\approx100r_{\rm g}$. Moreover, the temperature and strength of
the warm corona have to change significantly too to explain the variable
underlying soft X-ray emission. Lastly, we investigate the possibility of
variable intrinsic power-law emission from the hot corona combined with
variable absorption in UGC 11763 without changing the geometry of the corona in
the third model. This hybrid model provides a slightly better fit than the
partially-covering absorption model with improvements in fitting the iron
emission band. Current CCD-resolution data cannot distinguish these spectral

Core Attribute Evolution Network (CAEN), which partitions the user sequence

attribute dynamics with these users. Under this framework, we further devise a
hierarchical attention mechanism that applies attribute-aware attention for

colour vision by examining changes in chromatic sensitivity when viewing visual
displays through a slightly tinted (blue-blocking) filter and through a heavily
tinted, orange coloured filter. The CAD test was used to measure both red/green
(RG) and yellow/blue (YB) chromatic sensitivity in ten subjects when viewing
visual displays through each of the two filters. The measured RG and YB colour
thresholds were then compared with similar measurements made without coloured
filters in front of the eye. The blue-blocking filter absorbs only a small
amount of short-wavelength light whilst the orange filter attenuates
preferentially more short wavelength and some middle-wavelength light. The
results show that the blue-blocking filter does not affect significantly either
RG or YB colour vision. The orange filter, on the other hand, causes large
changes in colour discrimination. The results were analysed statistically by
comparing results obtained with the coloured filters with those measured
without any filters in front of the eye. More experimental work is now needed
to establish how much short wavelength light can be removed without affecting
significantly the subject's colour discrimination performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14211v1

Recently, contrastive learning shows great success on self-supervised

values of thermal resistance of a laser diode, the lasing wavelength is
red-shifted due to the change of the refractive index caused by a thermal

shift related to a refractive index change induced by the carrier injection. We
propose to benefit from the ability to tune wavelength by the pump current

questions about the anatomical variations across the population. Complex
anatomical structures have many diverse parts with varying interactions or
intricate architecture. For example, the heart is four-chambered anatomy with
several shared boundaries between chambers. Coordinated and efficient
contraction of the chambers of the heart is necessary to adequately perfuse end

On a heuristic point of view concerning the optical activity,2022-09-16T14:48:10Z,"Chun-Fang Li, Zhi-Juan Hu","Motivated by a recent finding that Fresnel's phenomenological description of
the optical activity in the chiral medium is not self-consistent, we conduct a
thorough investigation into the nature of the polarization of a plane light
wave. We demonstrate that the polarization of light is the reflection of one of
its quantum-mechanical properties, called the quasi-spin. Unexpectedly, the
quasi-spin is not an observable with respect to the laboratory coordinate
system. Instead, it is with respect to the momentum-dependent local coordinate
system. The representative operators for the quasi-spin are the Pauli matrices.
The wavefunction is the Jones vector. In order to completely determine a state
of polarization, two different kinds of degrees of freedom are needed. One is
the degrees of freedom to characterize the state of quasi-spin. They are the
Stokes parameters, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices in the state
described by the Jones vector. The other is the degrees of freedom to specify
the local coordinate system, including the propagation direction and an angle
of rotation about it. Accordingly, there are two independent mechanisms to
change the state of polarization. One is to change the state of quasi-spin in a
fixed local coordinate system. This is the traditional mechanism that can be
expressed as an SU(2) rotation of the Jones vector. The other is to change the
local coordinate system with the state of quasi-spin remaining fixed in it. At
last, we show that it is the newly-identified mechanism that accounts for the
optical activity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07982v1

attempt to accurately forecast future death-rate patterns for different age
groups and time horizons still attracts active research. Such a predictive
focus has motivated an increasing shift towards more flexible representations
of age-specific period mortality trajectories at the cost of reduced
interpretability. Although this perspective has led to successful predictive
strategies, the inclusion of interpretable structures in modeling of human
mortality can be, in fact, beneficial for improving forecasts. We pursue this
direction via a novel B-spline process with locally-adaptive dynamic
coefficients. Such a process outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting
strategies by explicitly incorporating the core structures of period mortality
within an interpretable formulation which enables inference on age-specific
mortality trends and the corresponding rates of change across time. This is
obtained by modeling the age-specific death counts via a Poisson log-normal
model parameterized through a linear combination of B-spline bases with dynamic
coefficients that characterize time changes in mortality rates via suitable
stochastic differential equations. While flexible, the resulting formulation
can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian state-space model that facilitates
closed-form Kalman filtering, smoothing and forecasting, for both the trends of
the spline coefficients and the corresponding first derivatives, which measure
rates of change in mortality for different ages. As illustrated in applications

"Transfer learning for self-supervised, blind-spot seismic denoising",2022-09-25T12:58:10Z,"Claire Birnie, Tariq Alkhalifah","Noise in seismic data arises from numerous sources and is continually
evolving. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of
seismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of
noise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in
characteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised,
blind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on
the raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise
assumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence
of even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks
can efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it
cannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network's
ability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise
properties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a
frugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised
manner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak
signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal
leakage observed, we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the
self-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This
is further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network
strikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction.
Finally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for
the supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior
geological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for
the dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network
should recording conditions change, to name a few.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12210v1
"Spatially Dependent Photometric Activity of M dwarfs in the Solar
  Cylinder",2022-09-27T01:46:19Z,"Seo-Won Chang, Christian Wolf, Christopher A. Onken","We study the relationship between Galactic location ($R, Z$) and photometric
activity for 3.6 million M dwarf stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. For this
purpose, we identify 906 unique flare events as a proxy for magnetic activity
from the SkyMapper Southern Survey DR3. We adopt vertical distance $|Z|$ from
the Galactic disc as a proxy for age and confirm a strong trend of flaring
fraction decreasing with growing stellar age. Among M dwarfs within 50 pc of
the Sun, we find a flaring fraction of 1-in-1,500, independent of spectral type
from M2 to M7, suggesting that these stars are all in a flare-saturated young
evolutionary stage. We find a hint of a kink in the slope of the overall flare
fraction near 100 pc from the plane, where a steep decline begins; this slope
change is visible for mid-type M dwarfs (M3--M5), suggesting it is not an
artefact of mixing spectral type. Together with SDSS H$\alpha$ emission, this
trend is additional evidence that the activity fraction of M dwarfs depends on
Galactic height and activity lifetime. While there is a hint of flattening of
the overall activity fraction above $|Z|\approx$ 500 pc, our data do not
constrain this further. Within $\sim$500 pc distance from the Sun, we find no
sign of radial disk gradients in flare activity, which may only be revealed by
samples covering a larger radial range.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13107v1
"View-Invariant Localization using Semantic Objects in Changing
  Environments",2022-09-28T21:26:38Z,"Jacqueline Ankenbauer, Kaveh Fathian, Jonathan P. How","This paper proposes a novel framework for real-time localization and
egomotion tracking of a vehicle in a reference map. The core idea is to map the
semantic objects observed by the vehicle and register them to their
corresponding objects in the reference map. While several recent works have
leveraged semantic information for cross-view localization, the main
contribution of this work is a view-invariant formulation that makes the
approach directly applicable to any viewpoint configuration for which objects
are detectable. Another distinctive feature is robustness to changes in the
environment/objects due to a data association scheme suited for extreme outlier
regimes (e.g., 90% association outliers). To demonstrate our framework, we
consider an example of localizing a ground vehicle in a reference object map
using only cars as objects. While only a stereo camera is used for the ground
vehicle, we consider reference maps constructed a priori from ground viewpoints
using stereo cameras and Lidar scans, and georeferenced aerial images captured
at a different date to demonstrate the framework's robustness to different
modalities, viewpoints, and environment changes. Evaluations on the KITTI
dataset show that over a 3.7 km trajectory, localization occurs in 36 sec and
is followed by real-time egomotion tracking with an average position error of
8.5 m in a Lidar reference map, and on an aerial object map where 77% of
objects are outliers, localization is achieved in 71 sec with an average
position error of 7.9 m.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14426v1
"Parameter-Conditioned Reachable Sets for Updating Safety Assurances
  Online",2022-09-29T17:45:03Z,"Javier Borquez, Kensuke Nakamura, Somil Bansal","Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing
the safety of autonomous systems. However, the provided safety assurances are
often predicated on the assumption that once deployed, the system or its
environment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system might
experience changes in system dynamics, control authority, external
disturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety
assurances. Rather than restarting the safety analysis from scratch, which can
be time-consuming and often intractable to perform online, we propose to
compute \textit{parameter-conditioned} reachable sets. Assuming expected system
and environment changes can be parameterized, we treat these parameters as
virtual states in the system and leverage recent advances in high-dimensional
reachability analysis to solve the corresponding reachability problem offline.
This results in a family of reachable sets that is parameterized by the
environment and system factors. Online, as these factors change, the system can
simply query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensure
system safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances. Through
various simulation studies, we demonstrate the capability of our approach in
maintaining system safety despite the system and environment evolution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14976v3

healthcare to manufacturing. Advanced automated machines are quite expensive,
but the end output is supposed to be of the highest possible quality. Depending
on the agility of requirements, these automation technologies can change
dramatically. The likelihood of making changes to automation software is
extremely high, so it must be updated regularly. If maintainability is not
taken into account, it will have an impact on the entire system and increase
maintenance costs. Many companies use different programming paradigms in
developing advanced automated machines based on client requirements. Therefore,
it is essential to estimate the maintainability of heterogeneous software. As a
result of the lack of widespread consensus on software maintainability
prediction (SPM) methodologies, individuals and businesses are left perplexed
when it comes to determining the appropriate model for estimating the
maintainability of software, which serves as the inspiration for this research.
A structured methodology was designed, and the datasets were preprocessed and
maintainability index (MI) range was also found for all the datasets expect for
UIMS and QUES, the metric CHANGE is used for UIMS and QUES. To remove the
uncertainty among the aforementioned techniques, a popular multiple criteria

typically derive exceptional catalytic activity from their large proportion of
under-coordinated surface sites which promote adsorption of reactant molecules.
Simultaneously, these high energy surface configurations are unstable, leading
to nanoparticle growth or degradation, and eventually a loss of catalytic
activity. Surface morphology of catalytic nanoparticles is paramount to
catalytic activity, selectivity, as well as degradation rates, however, it is
well-known that harsh reaction conditions can cause the surface structure to
change. Still, limited research has focused on understanding the link between
nanoparticle surface facets and degradation rates or mechanisms. Here, we study
a model Au supported catalyst system over a range of temperatures using a
combination of \textit{in situ} Transmission Electron Microscopy, kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations, and density functional theory calculations to establish an
atomistic picture of how variations in surface structures and atomic
coordination environments lead to shifting evolution mechanisms as a function
of temperature. By combining experimental results, which yield direct
observation of dynamic shape changes and particle evaporation rates, with
computational techniques, which enable understanding the fundamental
thermodynamics and kinetics of nanoparticle evolution, we illustrate a two-step
evolution mechanism in which mobile adatoms form through desorption from
low-coordination facets and subsequently evaporate off the particle surface. By
understanding the role of temperature in the competition between surface
diffusion and evaporation, we are able to show how individual atomic movements
lead to particle-scale morphological changes, and rationalize why evaporation

from 1994-2007, that found that all 12 varied periodically, with pulsation
periods in the range of ~38 to ~150 days. They are all carbon-rich, with F-G
spectral types. We combined our new (2008-2018) data with publicly-available
ASAS-SN data and determined new periods for their variability. The older and
newer period values were compared to investigate evidence of period change, for
which there is theoretical support that it might be detectable in a decade or
two in some cases. Such a detection is challenging since the light curves are
complicated, with multiple periods, changing amplitudes, and evidence of
shocks. Nevertheless, we found one, and possibly two, such cases, which are
associated with the higher temperature stars in the sample (7250 and 8000 K).
These results are most consistent with the evolution of stars at the lower end
of the mass range of carbon stars, ~1.5-2 M(sun). Several of the stars show
longer-term trends of increasing (six cases) or decreasing (one case)
brightness, which we think most likely due to changes in the circumstellar dust
opacity. There is one case of a possible ~1.8 yr period in addition to the
shorter pulsation. This is interpreted as possible evidence of an orbiting

"Detaching and Boosting: Dual Engine for Scale-Invariant Self-Supervised
  Monocular Depth Estimation",2022-10-08T07:38:11Z,"Peizhe Jiang, Wei Yang, Xiaoqing Ye, Xiao Tan, Meng Wu","Monocular depth estimation (MDE) in the self-supervised scenario has emerged
as a promising method as it refrains from the requirement of ground truth
depth. Despite continuous efforts, MDE is still sensitive to scale changes
especially when all the training samples are from one single camera. Meanwhile,
it deteriorates further since camera movement results in heavy coupling between
the predicted depth and the scale change. In this paper, we present a
scale-invariant approach for self-supervised MDE, in which scale-sensitive
features (SSFs) are detached away while scale-invariant features (SIFs) are
boosted further. To be specific, a simple but effective data augmentation by
imitating the camera zooming process is proposed to detach SSFs, making the
model robust to scale changes. Besides, a dynamic cross-attention module is
designed to boost SIFs by fusing multi-scale cross-attention features
adaptively. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the
detaching and boosting strategies are mutually complementary in MDE and our
approach achieves new State-of-The-Art performance against existing works from

it plays a vital role in the epigenetic control of gene expression and is
believed to be associated with mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and ageing. To
understand the microscopic structural changes in physical properties of DNA and
the resulting influence on its function due to oxidative damage of its
nucleotide bases, we have conducted all-atom molecular dynamic simulations of
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with its guanine bases being oxidized. The guanine
bases are more prone to oxidative damage due to the lowest value of redox
potential among all nucleobases. We have analyzed the local as well as global
mechanical properties of native and oxidized dsDNA and explained those results
by microscopic structural parameters and thermodynamic calculations. Our
results show that the oxidative damage of dsDNA does not deform the
Watson-Crick geometry; instead, the oxidized DNA structures are found to be
better stabilized through electrostatic interactions. Moreover, oxidative
damage changes the mechanical, helical, and groove parameters of dsDNA. The
persistence length, stretch modulus, and torsional stiffness are found to be
48.87 nm, 1239.26 pN, and 477.30 pN.nm^2, respectively, for native dsDNA, and
these values are 61.31 nm, 659.91 pN, and 407.79 pN.nm^2, respectively, when
all the guanine bases of the dsDNA are oxidized. Compared to the global
mechanical properties, the changes in helical and groove properties are found
to be more prominent, concentrated locally at the oxidation sites, and causing
the transition of the backbone conformations from BI to BII at the regions of
oxidative damage.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04235v1

  Learned 2D-3D Point-Line Correspondences",2022-10-10T10:29:07Z,"Xingyu Chen, Jianru Xue, Shanmin Pang","Vision-based localization in a prior map is of crucial importance for
autonomous vehicles. Given a query image, the goal is to estimate the camera
pose corresponding to the prior map, and the key is the registration problem of
camera images within the map. While autonomous vehicles drive on the road under
occlusion (e.g., car, bus, truck) and changing environment appearance (e.g.,
illumination changes, seasonal variation), existing approaches rely heavily on
dense point descriptors at the feature level to solve the registration problem,
entangling features with appearance and occlusion. As a result, they often fail
to estimate the correct poses. To address these issues, we propose a sparse
semantic map-based monocular localization method, which solves 2D-3D
registration via a well-designed deep neural network. Given a sparse semantic
map that consists of simplified elements (e.g., pole lines, traffic sign
midpoints) with multiple semantic labels, the camera pose is then estimated by
learning the corresponding features between the 2D semantic elements from the
image and the 3D elements from the sparse semantic map. The proposed sparse

collaborative robots (cobots) in human-robot collaborations. Robots that
interact minimally with humans can work with high speed and accuracy but cannot
adapt to new tasks or respond to unforeseen changes, whereas robots that work
closely with humans can but only by becoming passive to humans, meaning that
their main tasks suspended and efficiency compromised. Accordingly, this paper
proposes a new complementary framework for human-robot collaboration that
balances the safety of humans and the efficiency of robots. In this framework,
the robot carries out given tasks using a vision-based adaptive controller, and
the human expert collaborates with the robot in the null space. Such a
decoupling drives the robot to deal with existing issues in task space (e.g.,
uncalibrated camera, limited field of view) and in null space (e.g., joint
limits) by itself while allowing the expert to adjust the configuration of the
robot body to respond to unforeseen changes (e.g., sudden invasion, change of
environment) without affecting the robot's main task. Additionally, the robot
can simultaneously learn the expert's demonstration in task space and null
space beforehand with dynamic movement primitives (DMP). Therefore, an expert's
knowledge and a robot's capability are both explored and complementary. Human
demonstration and involvement are enabled via a mixed interaction interface,

closed-loop system is rigorously proved with Lyapunov methods. Experimental

Masked Motion Encoding for Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning,2022-10-12T11:19:55Z,"Xinyu Sun, Peihao Chen, Liangwei Chen, Changhao Li, Thomas H. Li, Mingkui Tan, Chuang Gan","How to learn discriminative video representation from unlabeled videos is
challenging but crucial for video analysis. The latest attempts seek to learn a
representation model by predicting the appearance contents in the masked
regions. However, simply masking and recovering appearance contents may not be
sufficient to model temporal clues as the appearance contents can be easily
reconstructed from a single frame. To overcome this limitation, we present
Masked Motion Encoding (MME), a new pre-training paradigm that reconstructs
both appearance and motion information to explore temporal clues. In MME, we
focus on addressing two critical challenges to improve the representation
performance: 1) how to well represent the possible long-term motion across
multiple frames; and 2) how to obtain fine-grained temporal clues from sparsely
sampled videos. Motivated by the fact that human is able to recognize an action
by tracking objects' position changes and shape changes, we propose to
reconstruct a motion trajectory that represents these two kinds of change in
the masked regions. Besides, given the sparse video input, we enforce the model
to reconstruct dense motion trajectories in both spatial and temporal

emission regime can occur after only slight changes to the peak driving
intensity and central driving wavelength. Time-domain analysis of harmonic

Dynamics-aware Adversarial Attack of Adaptive Neural Networks,2022-10-15T01:32:08Z,"An Tao, Yueqi Duan, Yingqi Wang, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou","In this paper, we investigate the dynamics-aware adversarial attack problem

designed under a basic assumption -- the network architecture is fixed

recently proposed adaptive neural networks, which adaptively deactivate
unnecessary execution units based on inputs to improve computational
efficiency. It results in a serious issue of lagged gradient, making the
learned attack at the current step ineffective due to the architecture change
afterward. To address this issue, we propose a Leaded Gradient Method (LGM) and

reformulate the gradients to be aware of the potential dynamic changes of

biodiversity loss and the intensification of agricultural production, threaten
the natural biosphere. These aspects seem somewhat disjunct and specific so
that it is hard to obtain a bigger picture of what these changes imply and to
distinguish beneficial from detrimental human impacts. Here I describe a
holistic approach that provides such a bigger picture and use it to understand
how the terrestrial biosphere can be sustained in the presence of increased
human activities. This approach focuses on the free energy generated by
photosynthesis, energy needed to sustain either the dissipative metabolic
activity of ecosystems or human activities, with the generation rate being set
by the physical constraints of the environment. We can then distinguish two
kinds of human impacts on the biosphere: detrimental effects caused by enhanced
human consumption of this free energy, and empowering effects that allow for
more photosynthetic activity and therefore more dissipative activity of the
biosphere. I use examples from the terrestrial biosphere to illustrate this
view as well as global datasets to show how this can be estimated. I then

Structural transitions in jammed asymmetric bidisperse granular packings,2022-10-25T09:17:52Z,"Juan C. Petit, Matthias Sperl","We study the local structural changes along the jamming transitions in
asymmetric bidisperse granu\-lar packings. The local structure of the packing
is assessed by the contact orientational order, $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$, that
quantifies the contribution of each contact configuration (Large-Large,
Small-Small, Large-Small, Small-Large) in the jammed structure. The partial
values of $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$ are calculated with respect to known ordered

that the packing undergoes a structural transition at $\phi_J$, manifested by a
sudden jump in the partial $\tilde{Q}_{\ell}$. Each contact configuration
contributes to the jammed structure in a different way, changing with $\delta$
and concentration of small particles, $X_{\mathrm{S}}$. The results show not

bidisperse packings exhibit local HCP and FCC structures also found in

Robust real-time imaging through flexible multimode fibers,2022-10-25T10:14:09Z,"Abdullah Abdulaziz, Simon Peter Mekhail, Yoann Altmann, Miles J. Padgett, Stephen McLaughlin","Conventional endoscopes comprise a bundle of optical fibers, associating one
fiber for each pixel in the image. In principle, this can be reduced to a
single multimode optical fiber (MMF), the width of a human hair, with one fiber
spatial-mode per image pixel. However, images transmitted through a MMF emerge
as unrecognizable speckle patterns due to dispersion and coupling between the
spatial modes of the fiber. Furthermore, speckle patterns change as the fiber
undergoes bending, making the use of MMFs in flexible imaging applications even
more complicated. In this paper, we propose a real-time imaging system using
flexible MMFs, but which is robust to bending. Our approach does not require
access or feedback signal from the distal end of the fiber during imaging. We
leverage a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct and classify images

eco-friendly barocaloric solid-state cooling. Here the barocaloric effect is
reported in an archetypal plastic crystal, adamantane. Adamantane has a
colossal isothermally reversible entropy change of 106 J K-1 kg-1 . Extremely
low hysteresis means that this can be accessed at pressure differences less
than 200 bar. Configurational entropy can only account for about 40% of the
total entropy change; the remainder is due to vibrational effects. Using
neutron spectroscopy and supercell lattice dynamics calculations, it is found
that this vibrational entropy change is mainly caused by softening in the
high-entropy phase of acoustic modes that correspond to molecular rotations. We
attribute this behaviour to the contrast between an 'interlocked' state in the
low-entropy phase and sphere-like behaviour in the high-entropy phase. Although
adamantane is a simple van der Waals solid with near-spherical molecules, this
approach can be leveraged for the design of more complex barocaloric molecular

neural networks to detect tumor progression in longitudinal datasets. The model
was evaluated on two datasets with a total of 64 scans from 32 patients

of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were used in this study. For
each patient, we trained their own neural network using just two images from
different timepoints. Our approach uses a Wasserstein-GAN (generative

differences between the two images. Using this map, the change in tumor volume
can be evaluated. Due to the combination of data augmentation and the network
architecture, co-registration of the two images is not needed. Furthermore, we
do not rely on any additional training data, (manual) annotations or
pre-training neural networks. The model received an AUC-score of 0.87 for tumor

"Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction Regularized by VAEs with
  Structured Image Covariance",2022-10-26T09:51:49Z,"Margaret Duff, Ivor J. A. Simpson, Matthias J. Ehrhardt, Neill D. F. Campbell","Objective: This paper investigates how generative models, trained on
ground-truth images, can be used \changes{as} priors for inverse problems,
penalizing reconstructions far from images the generator can produce. The aim
is that learned regularization will provide complex data-driven priors to
inverse problems while still retaining the control and insight of a variational
regularization method. Moreover, unsupervised learning, without paired training
data, allows the learned regularizer to remain flexible to changes in the
forward problem such as noise level, sampling pattern or coil sensitivities in
MRI.
  Approach: We utilize variational autoencoders (VAEs) that generate not only
an image but also a covariance uncertainty matrix for each image. The
covariance can model changing uncertainty dependencies caused by structure in
the image, such as edges or objects, and provides a new distance metric from
the manifold of learned images.
  Main results: We evaluate these novel generative regularizers on
retrospectively sub-sampled real-valued MRI measurements from the fastMRI
dataset. We compare our proposed learned regularization against other unlearned
regularization approaches and unsupervised and supervised deep learning
methods.
  Significance: Our results show that the proposed method is competitive with
other state-of-the-art methods and behaves consistently with changing sampling
patterns and noise levels.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14586v2

by a large fictitious magnetic field generated by the non-zero Berry curvature.
We performed the analysis of the electrical transport measurements of the
magnetic Weyl semimetal Mn$_{3}$Ge in the a-b and a-c plane. We have observed
negative longitudinal magneto-resistance (LMR) at a low magnetic field ($B<1.5$
T) along all the axes. The high field LMR shows different behavior along x and
z axes. A similar trend has been observed in the case of planar Hall effect
(PHE) measurements as well. The nature of high field LMR along the x axis
changes near 200 K. Dominant carrier concentration type, and metallic to
semimetallic transition also occur near 200 K. These observations suggest two
main conclusions: (i) The high field LMR in Mn$_3$Ge is driven by the metallic
- semimetallic nature of the compound. (ii) Mn$_3$Ge compound goes through an
electronic band topological transition near 200 K. Single crystal neutron
diffraction does not show any change in the magnetic structure below 300 K.
However, the in-plane lattice parameter (a) shows a maximum near 230 K.
Therefore, it is possible that the change in electronic band structure near 200

to synthesize motion with the same semantics as the input text. However, due to
the lack of diverse labeled training data, most approaches either limit to
specific types of text annotations or require online optimizations to cater to
the texts during inference at the cost of efficiency and stability. In this
paper, we investigate offline open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation in a
zero-shot learning manner that neither requires paired training data nor extra
online optimization to adapt for unseen texts. Inspired by the prompt learning
in NLP, we pretrain a motion generator that learns to reconstruct the full
motion from the masked motion. During inference, instead of changing the motion
generator, our method reformulates the input text into a masked motion as the
prompt for the motion generator to ``reconstruct'' the motion. In constructing
the prompt, the unmasked poses of the prompt are synthesized by a text-to-pose
generator. To supervise the optimization of the text-to-pose generator, we
propose the first text-pose alignment model for measuring the alignment between
texts and 3D poses. And to prevent the pose generator from overfitting to
limited training texts, we further propose a novel wordless training mechanism
that optimizes the text-to-pose generator without any training texts. The

therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental
processes and understand their joint development. The latent growth curve model
(LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the
TVC's effect on a longitudinal outcome while simultaneously modeling the
outcome's change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in
the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC's effect into
initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this
limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial
trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random
intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized
as (1) interval-specific slopes, (2) interval-specific changes, or (3) changes
from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We
demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses,
assuming a linear-linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The
results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and
precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and

superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey (x = 0.2, 0.5, y = 0-1.05) and the
observation of weak antilocalization (WAL). Electrical resistivity and Hall
coefficients for the Se-poor samples increase with decreasing temperature. The
increase becomes less pronounced with increasing Se concentration indicating a
loss of insulating behavior. Interestingly, the moderately Se-substituted
samples exhibit metallic behavior in the high-temperature region and a weak
increase in the resistivity in the low-temperature regions, which indicates the
existence of carrier localization. The heavily Se-substituted compounds show
metallic behavior in the entire-temperature region. Sign changes of the Hall
coefficients are observed for the x = 0.2 samples, which possibly is related to
a charge-density wave (CDW). Magnetoresistance measurements indicate that WAL
is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened
by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of the WAL and WL
emerges around the moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of
the resistivity behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates to the
difference of the magnetoconductance. Moreover, the localization regions of the
WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the CDW. We
propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform for studying
relationship between WAL, superconductivity, and electronic ordering because

proposed to improve the performance in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.
However, a typical UDA task is usually challenged by dynamically changing
factors, such as variable weather, views, and background in the unlabeled
target domain. Most previous ensemble strategies ignore UDA's dynamic and
uncontrollable challenge, facing limited feature representations and
performance bottlenecks. To enhance the model, adaptability between domains and
reduce the computational cost when deploying the ensemble model, we propose a
novel framework, namely Instance aware Model Ensemble With Distillation, IMED,
which fuses multiple UDA component models adaptively according to different
instances and distills these components into a small model. The core idea of
IMED is a dynamic instance aware ensemble strategy, where for each instance, a
nonlinear fusion subnetwork is learned that fuses the extracted features and
predicted labels of multiple component models. The nonlinear fusion method can
help the ensemble model handle dynamically changing factors. After learning a
large capacity ensemble model with good adaptability to different changing
factors, we leverage the ensemble teacher model to guide the learning of a
compact student model by knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we provide the
theoretical analysis of the validity of IMED for UDA. Extensive experiments

changes in structure formation and deflection angle resulting from MG can both
be considered, making the extraction of lensing signals more realistic. We find
good agreements between the measurement and theoretical prediction of ESD for
CG gravity. Meanwhile, the lensing signals are much less affected by the change
of the deflection angle than the change of the structure formation, indicating
a good approximation of regarding ESD (statistics) as the projection of 3D dark

range of core-mass fractions (CMFs). Imperfect collisions can preferentially
strip mantle material from a planet, changing its CMF, and are therefore
thought to be the most likely cause of this observed CMF variation. However,
previous work that implements these collisions into N-body simulations of
planet formation has struggled to reliably form high CMF super-Earths. In this
work, we specify our initial conditions and simulation parameters to maximize
the prevalence of high-energy, CMF-changing collisions in order to form planets
with highly diverse CMFs. High-energy collisions have a large $v_{imp}/v_{esc}$
ratio, so we maximize this ratio by starting simulations with high-eccentricity
and inclination disks to increase the difference in their orbital velocities,
maximizing $v_{imp}$. Additionally, we minimize $v_{esc}$ by starting with
small embryos. The final planets undergo more high-energy, debris-producing
collisions, and experience significant CMF change over their formation.
However, we find that a number of processes work together to average out the
CMF of a planet over time, therefore we do not consistently form high-CMF, high
mass planets. We do form high-CMF planets below 0.5 $M_{\oplus}$. Additionally,
we find in these highly eccentric environments, loss of debris mass due to
collisional grinding has a significant effect on final planet masses and CMFs,
resulting in smaller planets and a higher average planet CMF. This work
highlights the importance of improving measurements of high-density planets to
better constrain their CMFs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10491v2

and rough solid surfaces is studied through coarse grained simulations. Using
the dissipative particle dynamics method, we design solid liquid interfaces,
confining a pure liquid between two explicit solid surfaces with different
roughness degrees. The roughness of the solid phase was characterized by Wenzel
roughness factor and the effective SL IFT ({\gamma}_sl^') is reported as a
function of it also. Two solid liquid systems differentiated from each other by
their solid liquid repulsion strength are studied to measure the effects caused
by the surface roughness on the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^'. We found that the
roughness produces changes in the structure of the liquid, which is observed in
the first layer of liquid near the solid. These changes are responsible for the
effective SL IFT increase as surface roughness increases. Although there is a
predominance of surface roughness in the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^', it is
found that the effective SL IFT is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the solid liquid repulsion strength. The insights provided by these simulations
suggest that the increase of Wenzel roughness factor is a direct consequence of
the increase in surface area due to the vertical deviations measured in the
topography. This, in turn, produces an increase in the number of effective
solid liquid interactions between particles, eventually yielding significant
changes in the local values of the normal and tangential components of the

by the spin torque is commonly used to produce the sigmoid activation function.
However, the shape of the activation function in previous studies is fixed

and results in a limited performance. In this work, we exploit the physics
behind the spin torque induced magnetization switching to enable the dynamic
change of the activation function during the training process. Specifically,
the pulse width and magnetic anisotropy can be electrically controlled to
change the slope of activation function, which enables a faster or slower
change of output required by the backpropagation algorithm. This is also
similar to the idea of batch normalization that is widely used in the machine
learning. Thus, this work demonstrates that the algorithms are no longer
limited to the software implementation. They can in fact be realized by the
spintronic hardware using a single device. Finally, we show that the accuracy
of hand-written digit recognition can be improved from 88% to 91.3% by using
these trainable spintronic neurons without introducing additional energy

prices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for food
increased 4.1% and 3.7% over the year ended in August 2020 and August 2021,
respectively, while the amount of annual increase in the food prices prior to
the COVID-19 pandemic is less than 2.0%. Previous studies show that such kinds
of exogenous disasters, including the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, 9/11 terrorist
attacks, and major infectious diseases, and the resulted unusual food prices
often led to subsequent changes in people's consumption behaviors. We
hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic causes food price changes and the price
changes alter people's grocery shopping behaviors as well. To thoroughly
explore this, we formulate our analysis from two different perspectives, by
collecting data both globally, from China, Japan, United Kingdom, and United
States, and locally, from different groups of people inside the US. In
particular, we analyze the trends between food prices and COVID-19 as well as
between food prices and spending, aiming to find out their correlations and the
lessons for preparing the next pandemic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15515v1

liquid discharge and propulsion processes for aerospace applications. A
representative case is the sessile water droplets exposed to high vacuum, which

unexplored aspect of the mechanism governing icing droplet self-launching from
superhydrophobic surfaces when exposed to low pressures (~100 Pa). In contrast
to the previously reported recalescence-induced local overpressure underneath
the droplet that propels icing droplet self-jumping, we show that the
progressive recalescence over the free surface plays a significant role in
droplet icing and jumping. The joint contribution of the top-down vaporization
momentum and bottom-up local overpressure momentum leads to
vaporization-compression-detaching dynamics of the freezing droplets. We
delineate the jumping velocity of the icing droplet by analyzing droplet
vaporization mediated by freezing and substrate structuring, and reveal jumping

by aircraft and rockets for diversion and masking of targets. It is often
released across the United States for training purposes, and, due to its
resonant cut lengths, is often observed on the S-band Weather Surveillance

chaff and other non-meteorological targets algorithmically require a
statistical understanding of the targets. Previous studies of chaff

spatiotemporal representation of cases compared to previous studies, new
analyses of height dependence, as well as changes in statistics by volume

of people globally living in coastal zones. Models representing coastal
adaptation and impacts are important tools to inform the design of strategies
to manage these risks. Representing the often deep uncertainties influencing
these risks poses nontrivial challenges. A common uncertainty characterization
approach is to use a few benchmark cases to represent the range and relative
probabilities of the set of possible outcomes. This has been done in coastal
adaptation studies, for example, by using low, moderate, and high percentiles
of an input of interest, like sea-level changes. A key consideration is how
this simplified characterization of uncertainty influences the distributions of
estimated coastal impacts. Here, we show that using only a few benchmark
percentiles to represent uncertainty in future sea-level change can lead to
overconfident projections and underestimate high-end risks as compared to using
full ensembles for sea-level change and socioeconomic parametric uncertainties.
When uncertainty in future sea level is characterized by low, moderate, and
high percentiles of global mean sea-level rise, estimates of high-end (95th
percentile) damages are underestimated by between 18% (SSP1-2.6) and 46%
(SSP5-8.5). Additionally, using the 5th and 95th percentiles of sea-level
scenarios underestimates the 5-95% width of the distribution of adaptation
costs by a factor ranging from about two to four, depending on SSP-RCP pathway.
The resulting underestimation of the uncertainty range in adaptation costs can
bias adaptation and mitigation decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16460v1
"Deep Kernel Learning for Mortality Prediction in the Face of Temporal
  Shift",2022-12-01T15:04:05Z,"Miguel Rios, Ameen Abu-Hanna","Neural models, with their ability to provide novel representations, have
shown promising results in prediction tasks in healthcare. However, patient
demographics, medical technology, and quality of care change over time. This
often leads to drop in the performance of neural models for prospective
patients, especially in terms of their calibration. The deep kernel learning
(DKL) framework may be robust to such changes as it combines neural models with
Gaussian processes, which are aware of prediction uncertainty. Our hypothesis
is that out-of-distribution test points will result in probabilities closer to
the global mean and hence prevent overconfident predictions. This in turn, we
hypothesise, will result in better calibration on prospective data.
  This paper investigates DKL's behaviour when facing a temporal shift, which
was naturally introduced when an information system that feeds a cohort
database was changed. We compare DKL's performance to that of a neural baseline
based on recurrent neural networks. We show that DKL indeed produced superior
calibrated predictions. We also confirm that the DKL's predictions were indeed
less sharp. In addition, DKL's discrimination ability was even improved: its

variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) MKN 110. By combining various archival
data with new data, we cover an unprecedented long period of $\sim$30 years

factor of forty and varies more strongly than the optical continuum. Following
Ferland et al. (2020), we take He II $\lambda 4686$ as a proxy for the FUV
continuum and compare the flux of several other line species against it. This
comparison reveals a clear pattern, whereby lines respond close to linearly at
low FUV fluxes, and saturate at high FUV fluxes. The saturation level of the
response appears to depend on the excitation energy of the line species. In
addition to this global pattern, we note changes among observational epochs,
indicating a structural evolution in the broad line region (BLR). The line
profiles in our spectra show an offset between the narrow and broad components
of the He II $\lambda 4686$ and H$\beta$ lines. This offset shows a significant
negative correlation with the FUV flux and a positive correlation with the line
velocity width. Our analysis reveals a complex BLR response to a changing

shear layer in a scramjet isolator is investigated numerically using
detached-eddy simulations (DES). The effect of changing the position of the
shock train by controlling the back pressure ratio and the effect of changing
the cavity front wall angle are analyzed using unsteady statistics and modal
analysis. The propagation mechanism of the pressure disturbance was
investigated by spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient analysis. In the
present numerical study, a constant isolator section with a cavity front wall
was considered, followed by a diffuser section simulated at Mach number 2.2
with three different back pressure ratios. The change in back pressure provides
three different conditions. To understand the unsteady dynamics of the
interaction of the shear layer with the shock train, the spatiotemporal
trajectory of the wall pressure and the centerline pressure distribution, the
spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient, and the modal analysis by dynamic
mode decomposition are obtained. The results show that the low-frequency shock
train oscillation dominates the cavity oscillation. The spatiotemporal
cross-correlation between the wall surface and the cavity bottom wall indicates
the propagation of local disturbances originating from the separated boundary
layer caused by the shock and the recirculation zone in the corners of the
cavity. Dynamic mode decomposition analysis shows the shear layer at the
leading edge of the cavity and the downstream propagation of large eddies from
the cavity. It also shows the pairing of coherent structures between the shock

have recent data beyond 2015/16. Our objective in estimating the set of related
contraceptive supply-share outcomes (proportion of modern contraceptive methods

information across countries and sub-continents, model the changes in the
contraceptive supply share over time, account for survey observational errors

composition in an ecosystem. Conventional studies have focused on fixed
population structures to reveal how interactions shape population compositions.
However, interaction structures are not fixed, but change over time due to
invasions. Thus, invasion and interaction play an important role in shaping
communities. Despite its importance, however, the interplay between invasion
and interaction has not been well explored. Here, we investigate how invasion
affects the population composition with interactions in open evolving systems
considering generalized Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics. Our results show that the
system has two distinct regimes. One is characterized by low diversity with
abrupt changes of dominant species in time, appearing when the interaction
between species is strong and invasion slowly occurs. On the other hand,
frequent invasions can induce higher diversity with slow changes in abundances
despite strong interactions. It is because invasion happens before the system
reaches its equilibrium, which drags the system from its equilibrium all the
time. All species have similar abundances in this regime, which implies that
fast invasion induces regime shift. Therefore, whether invasion or interaction
dominates determines the population composition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05187v1
"Industrially Applicable System Regression Test Prioritization in
  Production Automation",2022-12-09T13:44:52Z,"Sebastian Ulewicz, Birgit Vogel-Heuser","When changes are performed on an automated production system (aPS), new
faults can be accidentally introduced in the system, which are called
regressions. A common method for finding these faults is regression testing. In
most cases, this regression testing process is performed under high time
pressure and on-site in a very uncomfortable environment. Until now, there is
no automated support for finding and prioritizing system test cases regarding
the fully integrated aPS that are suitable for finding regressions. Thus, the
testing technician has to rely on personal intuition and experience, possibly
choosing an inappropriate order of test cases, finding regressions at a very
late stage of the test run. Using a suitable prioritization, this iterative
process of finding and fixing regressions can be streamlined and a lot of time
can be saved by executing test cases likely to identify new regressions
earlier. Thus, an approach is presented in this paper that uses previously
acquired runtime data from past test executions and performs a change
identification and impact analysis to prioritize test cases that have a high
probability to unveil regressions caused by side effects of a system change.
The approach was developed in cooperation with reputable industrial partners

The Stable Artist: Steering Semantics in Diffusion Latent Space,2022-12-12T16:21:24Z,"Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Felix Friedrich, Dominik Hintersdorf, Kristian Kersting","Large, text-conditioned generative diffusion models have recently gained a
lot of attention for their impressive performance in generating high-fidelity

unfeasible in a one-shot fashion. On the contrary, text-guided image generation
involves the user making many slight changes to inputs in order to iteratively
carve out the envisioned image. However, slight changes to the input prompt
often lead to entirely different images being generated, and thus the control
of the artist is limited in its granularity. To provide flexibility, we present
the Stable Artist, an image editing approach enabling fine-grained control of
the image generation process. The main component is semantic guidance (SEGA)
which steers the diffusion process along variable numbers of semantic
directions. This allows for subtle edits to images, changes in composition and
style, as well as optimization of the overall artistic conception. Furthermore,
SEGA enables probing of latent spaces to gain insights into the representation

Quantifying Tipping Risks in Power Grids and beyond,2022-12-13T17:55:18Z,"Martin Heßler, Oliver Kamps","Critical transitions, ubiquitous in nature and technology, necessitate
anticipation to avert adverse outcomes. While many studies focus on
bifurcation-induced tipping, where a control parameter change leads to
destabilization, alternative scenarios are conceivable, e.g. noise-induced
tipping by an increasing noise level in a multi-stable system. Although the
generating mechanisms can be different, the observed time series can exhibit
similar characteristics. Therefore, we propose a Bayesian Langevin approach,
implemented in an open-source tool, which is capable of quantifying both
deterministic and intrinsic stochastic dynamics simultaneously. After a
detailed proof of concept, we analyse two bus voltage frequency time series of
the historic North America Western Interconnection blackout on 10th August
1996. Our results unveil the intricate interplay of changing resilience and
noise influence. A comparison with the blackout's timeline supports our
frequency dynamics' Langevin model, with the BL-estimation indicating a
permanent grid state change already two minutes before the officially defined
triggering event. A tree-related high impedance fault or sudden load increases
may serve as earlier triggers during this event, as suggested by our findings.

Onset of visible capillary waves from high-frequency acoustic excitation,2022-12-16T21:54:46Z,"Shuai Zhang, Jeremy Orosco, James Friend","Remarkably, the interface of a fluid droplet will produce visible capillary
waves when exposed to acoustic waves. For example, a small ($\sim\! 1 \mu$L)
sessile droplet will oscillate at a low $\sim\!10^2$~Hz frequency when weakly
driven by acoustic waves at $\sim\!10^6$~Hz frequency and beyond. We measured
such a droplet's interfacial response to 6.6~MHz ultrasound to gain insight
into the energy transfer mechanism that spans these vastly different
timescales, using high-speed microscopic digital transmission holography, a
unique method to capture three-dimensional surface dynamics at nanometer space
and microsecond time resolutions. We show that low-frequency capillary waves
are driven into existence via a feedback mechanism between the acoustic
radiation pressure and the evolving shape of the fluid interface. The acoustic
pressure is distributed in the standing wave cavity of the droplet, and as the
shape of the fluid interface changes in response to the distributed pressure
present on the interface, the standing wave field also changes shape, feeding
back to produce changes in the acoustic radiation pressure distribution in the
cavity. A physical model explicitly based upon this proposed mechanism is
provided, and simulations using it were verified against direct observations of
both the microscale droplet interface dynamics from holography and internal
pressure distributions using microparticle image velocimetry. The
pressure-interface feedback model accurately predicts the vibration amplitude
threshold at which capillary waves appear, the subsequent amplitude and
frequency of the capillary waves, and the distribution of the standing wave

two zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons is studied, numerically, by the
tight-binding (TB) and non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) methods in the
presence of transverse and perpendicular electric fields. Our results show that
the change of the structure from a zigzag ribbon form to a disk one creates an
energy gap in the structure, so that for a typical nanodisk with a radius of
3.1 nm, the size of the energy gap is 3.88 eV. Besides, with this change, the
maximum Seebeck coefficient increases from 1.54 to 2.03 mV/K. Furthermore, we
can control the electron transmission and Seebeck coefficients with the help of
the electric fields. The numerical results show that with the increase of the
electric field, the transmission coefficient decreases, and the Seebeck

demonstrate the feasibility of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS)
optoretinography (ORG) for objective detection of dark adaptation (DA)

name suggests, evaluates whether systems can correctly understand the effect of
incremental changes. Specifically, TODAY introduces slight contextual changes
for given event pairs, and systems are asked to tell how this subtle contextual
change would affect relevant temporal relation distributions. To facilitate
learning, TODAY also annotates human explanations. We show that existing
models, including GPT-3.5, drop to random guessing on TODAY, suggesting that
they heavily rely on spurious information rather than proper reasoning for
temporal predictions. On the other hand, we show that TODAY's supervision style

variable categories for each of the returns in the three time periods, which
reveals an evolution of the investors behavior with regard to the progression
of regulation regimes. Based on our findings, we argue that the differences
among the levels and determinants of initial return, monthly return (intrinsic
value) and intramonth return (overreaction) in different time periods can be
largely explained by regulation regime changes along two dimensions: 1)
approval vs. registration and 2) listing day trading curbs and return limits.
We find that IPO pricing is demand-driven under the approval regime, but
value-driven under the registration regime. We further compare the impact of
regulation regime changes on ChiNext IPO pricing practice, and propose a future
research plan on ChiNext IPO pricing efficiency with policy implication.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11779v1
Multi-Lingual DALL-E Storytime,2022-12-22T07:06:35Z,"Noga Mudrik, Adam S. Charles","While recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) language models
demonstrate cutting-edge performance when working with English texts,
equivalent models do not exist in other languages or do not reach the same
performance level. This undesired effect of AI advancements increases the gap
between access to new technology from different populations across the world.
This unsought bias mainly discriminates against individuals whose English
skills are less developed, e.g., non-English speakers children. Following
significant advancements in AI research in recent years, OpenAI has recently
presented DALL-E: a powerful tool for creating images based on English text
prompts. While DALL-E is a promising tool for many applications, its decreased
performance when given input in a different language, limits its audience and
deepens the gap between populations. An additional limitation of the current
DALL-E model is that it only allows for the creation of a few images in
response to a given input prompt, rather than a series of consecutive coherent
frames that tell a story or describe a process that changes over time. Here, we
present an easy-to-use automatic DALL-E storytelling framework that leverages
the existing DALL-E model to enable fast and coherent visualizations of
non-English songs and stories, pushing the limit of the one-step-at-a-time
option DALL-E currently offers. We show that our framework is able to
effectively visualize stories from non-English texts and portray the changes in
the plot over time. It is also able to create a narrative and maintain
interpretable changes in the description across frames. Additionally, our
framework offers users the ability to specify constraints on the story
elements, such as a specific location or context, and to maintain a consistent
style throughout the visualization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11985v1
How an electrical current can stabilize a molecular nanojunction,2022-12-23T16:45:05Z,"André Erpenbeck, Yaling Ke, Uri Peskin, Michael Thoss","The stability of molecular junctions under transport is of the utmost
importance for the field of molecular electronics. This question is often
addressed within the paradigm of current-induced heating of nuclear degrees of
freedom or current-induced forces acting upon the nuclei. At the same time, an
essential characteristic of the failure of a molecular electronic device is its
changing conductance -- typically from a finite value for the intact device to
zero for a device that lost its functionality. In this publication, we focus on
the current-induced changes in the molecular conductance, which are inherent to
molecular junctions at the limit of mechanical stability. We employ a
numerically exact framework based on the hierarchical equations of motion
approach, which treats both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on an
equal footing and does not impose additional assumptions. Studying generic
model systems for molecular junctions with dissociative potentials for a wide
range of parameters spanning the adiabatic and the nonadiabatic regime, we find
that molecular junctions that exhibit a decrease in conductance upon
dissociation are more stable than junctions that are more conducting in their
dissociated state. This represents a new mechanism that stabilizes molecular
junctions under current. Moreover, we identify characteristic signatures in the
current of breaking junctions related to the interplay between changes in the
conductance and the nuclear configuration and show how these are related to
properties of the leads rather than characteristics of the molecule itself.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12460v1

characterized by airflow limitation. This study develops a systems engineering
framework for representing important mechanistic details of COPD in a model of

breathing. Four engineering control system components are considered: sensor,
controller, actuator, and the process itself. Knowledge of human anatomy and
physiology is used to develop appropriate mechanistic mathematical models for
each component. Following a systematic analysis of the computational model, we
identify three physiological parameters associated with reproducing clinical
manifestations of COPD - changes in the forced expiratory volume (FEV), lung
volumes, and pulmonary hypertension. We quantify the changes in these
parameters (airway resistance, lung elastance, and pulmonary resistance) as the
ones that result in a systemic response that is diagnostic of COPD. A
multivariate analysis reveals that the changes in airway resistance have a
broad impact on the human cardio-respiratory system, and that the pulmonary
circuit is stressed beyond normal under hypoxic environments in most COPD
patients.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13207v1

BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ and BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ have drawn renewed interest to
XXZ models with competing interactions beyond the nearest neighbor exchange.
While the case of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange has been extensively
studied, the actual materials exhibit a ferromagnetic nearest neighbor
exchange. Here we show that such a sign change of the dominant nearest neighbor
coupling has substantial consequences on the phase diagram. In particular, the
nature of the quantum disordered phase of interest changes from a plaquette
valence bond crystal to a long-range entangled spin liquid phase. By means of
complementary numerical simulations, based on exact diagonalization and the
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group, we demonstrate the formation
of a gapless spin liquid state at the heart of the ferromagnetic phase diagram
in the isotropic Heisenberg limit, which gives way to out-of-plane Ising
magnetic order upon inclusion of XXZ anisotropy. The magnetically ordered
phases surrounding this quantum disordered region are much less sensitive to
the sign change of the dominant interaction and can be understood from their
classical analogs. We briefly comment on the relevance of our results for

  Change Memory",2022-12-28T20:38:32Z,"Manasa Kaniselvan, Mathieu Luisier, Marko Mladenović","In Valence Change Memory (VCM) cells, the conductance of an insulating
switching layer is reversibly modulated by creating and redistributing point
defects under an external field. Accurate simulations of the switching dynamics
of these devices can be difficult due to their typically disordered atomic
structures and inhomogeneous arrangements of defects. To address this, we
introduce an atomistic framework for modelling VCM cells. It combines a
stochastic Kinetic Monte Carlo approach for atomic rearrangement with a quantum
transport scheme, both parameterized at the ab-initio level by using inputs
from Density Functional Theory (DFT). Each of these steps operates directly on
the underlying atomic structure. The model thus directly relates the energy
landscape and electronic structure of the device to its switching
characteristics. We apply this model to simulate non-volatile switching between
high- and low-resistance states in an TiN/HfO2/Ti/TiN stack, and analyze both
the kinetics and stochasticity of the conductance transitions. We also resolve
the atomic nature of current flow resulting from the valence change mechanism,
finding that conductive paths are formed between the undercoordinated Hf atoms
neighboring oxygen vacancies. The model developed here can be applied to
different material systems to evaluate their resistive switching potential,
both for use as conventional memory cells and as neuromorphic computing
primitives.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14090v1
Subharmonic fidelity revival in a driven PXP model,2022-12-30T19:00:01Z,"HaRu K. Park, SungBin Lee","The PXP model hosts a special set of nonergodic states, referred to as
quantum many-body scars. One of the consequences of quantum scarring is the
periodic revival of the wave function fidelity. It has been reported that
quantum fidelity revival occurs in the PXP model for certain product states,
and periodic driving of chemical potential can enhance the magnitude of quantum
revival, and can even change the frequencies of revival showing the subharmonic
response. Although the effect of the periodic driving in the PXP model has been
studied in the limit of certain perturbative regimes, the general mechanism of
such enhanced revival and frequency change has been barely studied. In this
work, we investigate how periodic driving in the PXP model can systematically
control the fidelity revival. Particularly, focusing on the product state so
called a Neel state, we analyze the condition of driving to enhance the
magnitude of revival or change the frequencies of revival. To clarify the
reason of such control, we consider the similarities between the PXP model and
the free spin-1/2 model in graph theoretical analysis, and show that the
quantum fidelity feature in the PXP model is well explained by the free
spin-1/2 model. In addition, under certain limit of the driving parameters,
analytic approach to explain the main features of the fidelity revival is also
performed. Our results give an insight of the scarring nature of the
periodically driven PXP model and pave the way to understand their

"Using Non-Stationary Bandits for Learning in Repeated Cournot Games with
  Non-Stationary Demand",2022-01-03T05:51:47Z,"Kshitija Taywade, Brent Harrison, Judy Goldsmith","Many past attempts at modeling repeated Cournot games assume that demand is
stationary. This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market
demands can evolve over a product's lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this
paper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that
firms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit
problem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents
discrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are
independent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;
they can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work
towards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with
Weighted Exploration (AWE) $\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the
well-known $\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies
changes in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and
exploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus
enabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient
exploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes
advantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the
emergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the
scalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and
the size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in
our models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly
change their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also
engage in collusive behavior in many simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00486v1

"On the Robustness of Sparse Counterfactual Explanations to Adverse
  Perturbations",2022-01-22T13:57:45Z,"Marco Virgolin, Saverio Fracaros","Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a powerful means for understanding how
decisions made by algorithms can be changed. Researchers have proposed a number
of desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring
minimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. We consider a further
aspect to improve the usability of CEs: robustness to adverse perturbations,
which may naturally happen due to unfortunate circumstances. Since CEs
typically prescribe a sparse form of intervention (i.e., only a subset of the
features should be changed), we study the effect of addressing robustness
separately for the features that are recommended to be changed and those that
are not. Our definitions are workable in that they can be incorporated as
penalty terms in the loss functions that are used for discovering CEs. To
experiment with robustness, we create and release code where five data sets
(commonly used in the field of fair and explainable machine learning) have been
enriched with feature-specific annotations that can be used to sample
meaningful perturbations. Our experiments show that CEs are often not robust
and, if adverse perturbations take place (even if not worst-case), the
intervention they prescribe may require a much larger cost than anticipated, or
even become impossible. However, accounting for robustness in the search
process, which can be done rather easily, allows discovering robust CEs
systematically. Robust CEs make additional intervention to contrast
perturbations much less costly than non-robust CEs. We also find that
robustness is easier to achieve for the features to change, posing an important
point of consideration for the choice of what counterfactual explanation is
best for the user. Our code is available at:

with sensing chemicals in sweat using electrical signals, but these methods are
not truly non-invasive nor non-intrusive because they require substantial
amounts of sweat to get a reading. This project aims to create a truly
non-invasive wearable sensor that continuously detects the gaseous acetone (a
biomarker related to metabolic disorders) that ambiently comes out of the skin.
Composite films of polyaniline and cellulose acetate, exhibiting
chemo-mechanical actuation upon exposure to gaseous acetone, were tested in the
headspaces above multiple solutions containing acetone, ethanol, and water to
gauge response sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability. The bending of the
films in response to exposures to these environments was tracked by an
automatic video processing code, which was found to out-perform an
off-the-shelf deep neural network-based tracker. Using principal component
analysis, we showed that the film bending is low dimensional with over 90% of
the shape changes being captured with just two parameters. We constructed
forward models to predict shape changes from the known exposure history and
found that a linear model can explain 40% of the observed variance in film tip
angle changes. We constructed inverse models, going from third order fits of
shape changes to acetone concentrations where about 45% of the acetone
variation and about 30% of ethanol variation are captured by linear models, and
non-linear models did not perform substantially better. This suggests there is
sufficient sensitivity and inherent selectivity of the films. These models,
however, provide evidence for substantial hysteretic or long-time-scale
responses of the PANI films, seemingly due to the presence of water. Further
experiments will allow more accurate discrimination of unknown exposure

NeuRegenerate: A Framework for Visualizing Neurodegeneration,2022-02-02T16:21:14Z,"Saeed Boorboor, Shawn Mathew, Mala Ananth, David Talmage, Lorna W. Role, Arie E. Kaufman","Recent advances in high-resolution microscopy have allowed scientists to
better understand the underlying brain connectivity. However, due to the
limitation that biological specimens can only be imaged at a single timepoint,
studying changes to neural projections is limited to general observations using
population analysis. In this paper, we introduce NeuRegenerate, a novel
end-to-end framework for the prediction and visualization of changes in neural
fiber morphology within a subject, for specified age-timepoints.To predict
projections, we present neuReGANerator, a deep-learning network based on
cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) that translates
features of neuronal structures in a region, across age-timepoints, for large
brain microscopy volumes. We improve the reconstruction quality of neuronal
structures by implementing a density multiplier and a new loss function, called
the hallucination loss.Moreover, to alleviate artifacts that occur due to
tiling of large input volumes, we introduce a spatial-consistency module in the
training pipeline of neuReGANerator. We show that neuReGANerator has a
reconstruction accuracy of 94% in predicting neuronal structures. Finally, to
visualize the predicted change in projections, NeuRegenerate offers two modes:
(1) neuroCompare to simultaneously visualize the difference in the structures
of the neuronal projections, across the age timepoints, and (2) neuroMorph, a
vesselness-based morphing technique to interactively visualize the
transformation of the structures from one age-timepoint to the other. Our

and identifying the best reviewer for a code change is a well-accepted problem
within the software engineering community. Selecting a reviewer who lacks
expertise and understanding can slow development or result in more defects. To
date, most reviewer recommendation systems rely primarily on historical file
change and review information; those who changed or reviewed a file in the past
are the best positioned to review in the future. We posit that while these
approaches are able to identify and suggest qualified reviewers, they may be
blind to reviewers who have the needed expertise and have simply never
interacted with the changed files before. Fortunately, at Microsoft, we have a
wealth of work artifacts across many repositories that can yield valuable
information about our developers. To address the aforementioned problem, we
present CORAL, a novel approach to reviewer recommendation that leverages a
socio-technical graph built from the rich set of entities (developers,
repositories, files, pull requests (PRs), work items, etc.) and their
relationships in modern source code management systems. We employ a graph
convolutional neural network on this graph and train it on two and a half years
of history on 332 repositories within Microsoft. We show that CORAL is able to
model the manual history of reviewer selection remarkably well. Further, based
on an extensive user study, we demonstrate that this approach identifies
relevant and qualified reviewers who traditional reviewer recommenders miss,
and that these developers desire to be included in the review process. Finally,
we find that ""classical"" reviewer recommendation systems perform better on
smaller (in terms of developers) software projects while CORAL excels on larger
projects, suggesting that there is ""no one model to rule them all.""",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02385v4
"Ketamine-Medetomidine General Anesthesia Occurs With Alternation of
  Cortical Electrophysiological Activity Between High and Low Complex States",2022-02-09T08:04:52Z,Eduardo Cocca Padovani,"Anesthetic agents are known to induce a range of alterations in cortical
electrophysiological activity, such as the rise of signature patterns, changes
in statistical properties, and altered dynamic behavior of neural records.
Plenty of methods can be used to monitor these changes, among them complexity
metrics demonstrated to have the power to discriminate states involving
distinct levels of awareness. There is a consensus that anesthetic drugs can
interfere with neural activities at different levels and time scales, being
able to induce alterations both locally and in the spatiotemporal patterns
established throughout the whole cortex. However, it is still unclear how such
changes in the complexity of cortical activity are supposed to occur, and
experimental evidence is still needed. For this purpose, we have analyzed an
ECoG records database of a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction in a
non-human primate subject. The MDR-ECoG technique provided records of cortical
activity with both high temporal and spatial resolution allied with extensive
coverage of the cortical surface. The Permutation Entropy and the Fractal
Dimension were employed to evaluate the complexity of the neural time series.
It was found that the complexity of cortical activity was relatively constant
during awakened conditions. The transition to unconsciousness occurred
relatively fast; it required about 30 to 40 seconds for the first remarkable
changes to take place. During anesthesia, the complexity assumed considerable
variation at local levels and fluctuated apparently without a defined period.
The cortex dynamically alternated between high and low complex states on a
global scale. This study provides novel evidence of the effects of anesthetics
on neural activity and cortical dynamics, contributing to the elucidation of
anesthetic mechanisms in terms of circuits, pathways, and global brain
functioning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04320v2

"A Queueing Model of Patient Flow for Stroke Networks to Estimate Acute
  Stroke Transfer Capacity",2022-02-14T22:55:38Z,"Hojun Choi, Ohad Perry, Jane Holl, Shyam Prabhakaran","Background: Most acute stroke (AS) patients in the United States are
initially evaluated at a primary stroke center (PSC) and a significant
proportion requires transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for
advanced treatment. A CSC typically accepts patients from multiple PSCs in its
network, leading to capacity limits. This study uses a queueing model to
estimate impacts on CSC capacity due to transfers from PSCs.
  Methods: The model assumes that the number of AS patients arriving at each
PSC, proportion of AS patients transferred, and length of stay in the CSC
Neurologic Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) by type of AS are random, while the
transfer rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic AS patients are control variables.
The main outcome measure is the ""overflow"" probability, namely, the probability
of a CSC not having capacity (unavailability of a Neuro-ICU bed) to accept a
transfer. Data simulations of the model, using a base case and an expanded
case, were performed to illustrate the effects of changing key parameters, such
as transfer rates from PSCs and CSC Neuro-ICU capacity on overflow capacity.
  Results: Data simulations of the model using a base case show that an
increase of a PSC's ischemic stroke transfer rate from 15% to 55% raises the
overflow probability from 30.62% to 36.13%. Further simulations of the expanded
case show that to maintain an a priori CSC overflow probability of 30.62% when
adding a PSC with a AS transfer rate of 15% to the network, other PSCs would
need to decrease their transfer rate by 12.5% or the CSC Neuro-ICU would need
to add 2 beds.
  Discussion: A queuing model can be used to estimate the effects of change in
the size of a PSC-CSC network, change in AS transfer rates, or change in number
of CSC Neuro-ICU beds of a CSC on its capacity on the overflow probability in
the CSC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07078v1

significant part of the whole solving time for many generic instances.
  Like the fastest known change of order algorithms, this work focuses on the
situation where the ideal defined by the system satisfies natural properties
which can be recovered in generic coordinates. First, the ideal has a
\emph{shape} lexicographic Gr\""obner basis. Second, the set of leading terms
with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic order has a \emph{stability}
property; in particular, the multiplication matrix can be read on the input
Gr\""obner basis.
  The current fastest algorithms rely on the sparsity of this matrix. Actually,
this sparsity is a consequence of an algebraic structure, which can be
exploited to represent the matrix concisely as a univariate polynomial matrix.
We show that the Hermite normal form of that matrix yields the sought
lexicographic Gr\""obner basis, under assumptions which cover the shape position
case. Under some mild assumption implying $n \le t$, the arithmetic complexity
of our algorithm is $O\tilde{~}(t^{\omega-1}D)$, where $n$ is the number of
variables, $t$ is a sparsity indicator of the aforementioned matrix, $D$ is the
degree of the zero-dimensional ideal under consideration, and $\omega$ is the
exponent of matrix multiplication. This improves upon both state-of-the-art
complexity bounds $O\tilde{~}(tD^2)$ and $O\tilde{~}(D^\omega)$, since $\omega
< 3$ and $t\le D$. Practical experiments, based on the libraries msolve and
PML, confirm the high practical benefit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09226v2

"A solar-cycle study of coronal rotation: large variations, rapid
  changes, and implications for solar wind models",2022-03-07T15:06:56Z,"Liam T. Edwards, David Kuridze, Thomas Williams, Huw Morgan","Information on the rotation rate of the corona, and its variation over
latitude and solar cycle, is valuable for making global connections between the
corona and the Sun, for global estimates of reconnection rates, and as a basic
parameter for solar wind modelling. Here, we use a time series of tomographical
maps gained from coronagraph observations between 2007 - 2020 to directly
measure the longitudinal drift of high-density streamers over time. The method
reveals abrupt changes in rotation rates, revealing a complex relationship
between the coronal rotation and the underlying photosphere. The majority of
rates are between -1.0 to +0.5$^\circ$/day relative to the standard Carrington
rate of 14.18$^\circ$/day, although rates are measured as low as
-2.2$^\circ$/day and as high as 1.6$^\circ$/day. Equatorial rotation rates
during the 2008 solar minimum are slightly faster than the Carrington rate,
with an abrupt switch to slow rotation in 2009, then a return to faster rates
in 2017. Abrupt changes and large variations in rates are seen at all
latitudes. Comparison with a magnetic model suggests that periods of equatorial
fast rotation are associated with times when a large proportion of the magnetic
footpoints of equatorial streamers are near the equator, and we interpret the
abrupt changes in terms of the latitudinal distribution of the streamer
photospheric footpoints. The coronal rotation rate is a key parameter for solar
wind models, and variations of up to a degree per day or more can lead to large
systematic errors over forecasting periods of longer than a few days. The
approach described in this paper gives corrected values that can form a part of
future forecasting efforts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03447v1

X-ray spectral shape and line of sight column density variation. The physical
mechanisms responsible for these variations are unclear. Here, we study the
spectral properties of a CLAGN, NGC\,1365 using combined {\it XMM-Newton} and
{\it NuSTAR} observations to understand the CL behavior. The model fitted mass
accretion rate varied between $0.003\pm 0.001$ and $0.009\pm0.002$ $\dot M_{\rm
Edd}$ and the dynamic corona changed from $28\pm 3$ to $10\pm1$ $r_g$. We found
that the variable absorption column density correlates with the mass accretion
rate and the geometry of the corona. The derived wind velocity was sufficiently
low compared to the escape velocity to drive the wind away from the disc for
the epochs when column densities were high. This suggests that the high and
variable absorption can be due to failed winds from the disc. Our estimated
ratio of mass outflow to inflow rate from the inner region of the disc lies
between $0.019\pm0.006$ and $0.12\pm0.04$. From spectral fitting of the
combined data, we found the mass of the central black hole to be constant
$4.38\pm0.34 - 4.51\pm0.29 \times10^{6} M_\odot$, consistent with earlier
findings. The confidence contours of $N_H$ with other model parameters show
that the model fitted parameters are robust and non-degenerate. Our study

small-scale dynamo (SSD) operating in the near-surface convection. The SSD
fields have consequences for solar granular convection, basal flux, as well as
chromospheric heating. A similar SSD mechanism is expected to be active in the
near-surface convection of other cool main-sequence stars, but this has never
been investigated. We aim to investigate changes in stratification and
convection due to inclusion of SSD fields for F3V, G2V, K0V and M0V spectral
types in the near-surface convection. 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of
the four stellar boxes, covering the subsurface convection zone up to the lower
photosphere in a small cartesian box, are studied using the \textit{MURaM}
radiative-MHD simulation code. The SSD runs are compared against reference
hydrodynamic runs. An SSD is found to efficiently produce magnetic field with
energies ranging between 5\% to 80\% of the plasma kinetic energy at different
depths. This ratio tends to be larger for larger $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The
relative change in density and gas pressure stratification for the deeper
convective layers due to SSD magnetic fields is negligible, except for the
F-star. For the F-star, there is a substantial reduction in convective
velocities due to Lorentz force feedback from magnetic fields, which, in turn,
reduces the turbulent pressure. SSD in near-surface convection for cool
main-sequence stars introduces small but significant changes in thermodynamic
stratification (especially for the F-star) due to reduction in convective

Adaptation to a changing environment: what me Normal?,2022-06-27T12:37:14Z,"Jimmy Garnier, O Cotto, T Bourgeron, E Bouin, T Lepoutre, O Ronce, V Calvez","Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is crucial
to assess the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical
studies have tackled this issue by modeling the evolution of quantitative
traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimum phenotype, whose
value is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population
fate results from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the
moving optimum. Such a distribution may vary with the shape of selection, the
system of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation kernel or their
interactions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative
measures of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from
the entire profile of the phenotypic distribution, without any a priori on its
shape.We investigate two different models of reproduction (asexual and
infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with general forms of selection.In
particular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away
from the optimum lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse
of the population when the speed of environmental change is too high. Our
unified framework furthermore allows highlighting the underlying mechanisms
that lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities
and discrepancies between the two reproduction models, the latter being
ultimately explained by different constraints on the evolution of the
phenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in the population
crucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the sexual
infinitesimal model, in contrast with the asexual model.In the asexual model,
we also investigate the effect of the mutation kernel and we show that kernels
with higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and improve fitness,
especially in fast changing environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13248v1

micro-tapping Optical Coherence Elastography (AuT-OCE) Main Outcome Measures:
Corneal elastic moduli (in-plane Young's, E, and out-of-plane shear, G) can be

face models. In a nutshell, NARRATE first inverts the input portrait to a
coarse geometry and employs neural rendering to generate images resembling the
input, as well as producing convincing pose changes. However, inversion step
introduces mismatch, bringing low-quality images with less facial details. As
such, we further estimate portrait normal to enhance the coarse geometry,
creating a high-fidelity physical face model. In particular, we fuse the neural
and physical renderings to compensate for the imperfect inversion, resulting in
both realistic and view-consistent novel perspective images. In relighting
stage, previous works focus on single view portrait relighting but ignoring
consistency between different perspectives as well, leading unstable and
inconsistent lighting effects for view changes. We extend Total Relighting to
fix this problem by unifying its multi-view input normal maps with the physical
face model. NARRATE conducts relighting with consistent normal maps, imposing
cross-view constraints and exhibiting stable and coherent illumination effects.
We experimentally demonstrate that NARRATE achieves more photorealistic,
reliable results over prior works. We further bridge NARRATE with animation and
style transfer tools, supporting pose change, light change, facial animation,
and style transfer, either separately or in combination, all at a photographic
quality. We showcase vivid free-view facial animations as well as 3D-aware
relightable stylization, which help facilitate various AR/VR applications like
virtual cinematography, 3D video conferencing, and post-production.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00974v2

"On the Perturbative Picture and the Chang-Refsdal Lens Approximation for
  Planetary Microlensing",2022-07-25T18:00:00Z,Keming Zhang,"Under the perturbative picture of planetary microlensing, the planet is
considered to act as a uniform-shear Chang-Refsdal lens on one of the two
images produced by the host star that comes close to the angular Einstein
radius of the planet, leaving the other image unaffected. However, this
uniform-shear approximation is only valid for isolated planetary caustics and
breaks down in the resonant regime. Recently, the planetary-caustic degeneracy
arising from the above formalism is found to generalize to the regime of
central and resonant caustics, indicating that the perturbative picture and
Chang-Refsdal lens approximation may have been under-explored in the past.
Here, I introduce a new variable-shear Chang-Refsdal lens approximation, which
not only supports central and resonant caustics, but also enables full
magnification maps to be calculated analytically. Moreover, I introduce the
generalized perturbative picture, which relaxes the required proximity between
the planet and the image being perturbed in the previous work. Specifically,
the planet always perturbs the image in the same half of the lens plane as the
planet itself, leaving the other image largely unaffected. It is demonstrated
how this new framework results in the offset degeneracy as a consequence of
physical symmetry. The generalized perturbative picture also points to an
approach to solve the two-body lens equation semi-analytically. The analytic
and semi-analytic microlensing solutions associated with this work may allow
for substantially faster light-curve calculations and modeling of observed
events. A python implementation is provided.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12412v3

  Period stability of known O+O overcontact systems",2022-08-02T18:01:52Z,"Michael Abdul-Masih, Ana Escorza, Athira Menon, Laurent Mahy, Pablo Marchant","Given that mergers are often invoked to explain many exotic phenomena in
massive star evolution, understanding the evolutionary phase directly preceding
a merger, the overcontact phase, is of crucial importance. Despite its
importance, large uncertainties exist in our understanding of the evolution of
massive overcontact binaries. We aim to provide robust observational
constraints on the future dynamical evolution of massive overcontact systems by
measuring the rate at which the periods change for a sample of six such
objects. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether the periods of unequal mass
systems show higher rates of change than their equal mass counterparts as
theoretical models predict. Using archival photometric data from various
ground- and space-based missions covering up to ~40 years, we measure the
periods of each system over several smaller time spans. We then fit a linear
regression through the measured periods to determine the rate at which the
period is changing over the entire data set. We find that all of the stars in
our sample have very small period changes and that there does not seem to be a
correlation with the mass ratio. This implies that the orbital periods for
these systems are stable on the nuclear timescale, and that the unequal mass
systems may not equalize as expected. When comparing our results with
population synthesis distributions, we find large discrepancies between the
expected mass ratios and period stabilities. We find that these discrepancies
can be mitigated to a degree by removing systems with shorter initial periods,
suggesting that the observed sample of overcontact systems may originate from
binary systems with longer initial orbital periods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01671v1

"Ices in planet-forming disks: Self-consistent ice opacities in disk
  models",2022-08-26T15:53:27Z,"Aditya M. Arabhavi, Peter Woitke, Stephanie M. Cazaux, Inga Kamp, Christian Rab, Wing-Fai Thi","In cold and shielded environments, molecules freeze out on dust grain
surfaces to form ices such as H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and NH3. In
protoplanetary disks, the exact radial and vertical ice extension depend on
disk mass, geometry, and stellar UV irradiation. The goal of this work is to
present a computationally efficient method to compute ice and bare-grain
opacities in protoplanetary disk models consistently with the chemistry and to
investigate the effect of ice opacities on the physico-chemical state and
optical appearance of the disk. A matrix of Mie efficiencies is pre-calculated
for different ice species and thicknesses, from which the position dependent
opacities of icy grains are then interpolated. This is implemented in the
PRODIMO code by a self-consistent solution of ice opacities and the local
composition of ices, which are obtained from our chemical network. Locally, the
opacity can change significantly, for example, an increase by a factor of more
than 200 in the midplane, especially at UV and optical wavelengths, due to ice
formation. This is mainly due to changes in the size distribution of dust
grains resulting from ice formation. However, since the opacity only changes in
the optically thick regions of the disk, the thermal disk structure does not
change significantly. For the same reason, the spectral energy distributions
computed with our disk models with ice opacities generally show only faint ice
emission features at far-IR wavelengths. The ice absorption features are only
seen in the edgeon orientation. The assumption made on how the ice is
distributed across the grain size distribution influences the far-IR and
millimeter slope of the SED. The ice features and their strengths are
influenced by the ice power law and the type of chemistry. Our models predict
stronger ice features for observations that can spatially resolve the disk,
particularly in absorption.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12739v1

activities of BPs groups. Aims. We aim to find out the evolution
characteristics of the brightness and number of BPs groups at different
brightness levels, and how these characteristics differ between quiet and
active regions. Methods. We propose a hybrid BPs detection model (HBD Model)
combining traditional technology and neural network. The Model is used to
detect and calculate the BPs brightness characteristics of each frame of
continuous high resolution image sequences of active and quiet regions in

the brightness from low to high. Finally, Fourier transform and inverse Fourier
transform are used to analyze the evolution of BPs brightness and quantity in
these four levels groups. Results. The activities of BPs groups are not random
and disorderly. In different levels of brightness, their quantity and
brightness evolution show complex changes. Among the four levels of brightness,
BPs in the active region were more active and intense than those in the quiet
region. However, the quantity and brightness evolution of BPs groups in the
quiet region showed the characteristics of large periodic changes and small
periodic changes in the medium and high brightness levels (level3 and level4).

the galaxy NGC 4156, as serendipitously discovered thanks to data acquired in
2019 at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) during a students' observing
programme. Previous optical spectra had never shown any signatures of
broad-line emission, and evidence of the AGN had come only from X-ray
observations, being the optical narrow-line flux ratios unable to unambiguously
denote this galaxy as a Seyfert. Our 2019 TNG data unexpectedly revealed the
appearance of broad-line components in both the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
profiles, along with a rise of the continuum, thus implying a changing-look AGN
transitioning from a type 2 (no broad-line emission) towards a (nearly) type 1.
The broad-line emission has then been confirmed by our 2022 follow-up
observations, whereas the rising continuum has no longer been detected, which
hints at a further evolution backwards to a (nearly) type 2. The presence of
broad-line components also allowed us to obtain the first single-epoch estimate
of the black hole mass (log(MBH/Msun) $\sim$ 8.1) in this source. The observed
spectral variability might be the result of a change in the accretion activity
of NGC 4156, although variable absorption cannot be completely excluded.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09341v1
"Weakly Supervised Learning with Automated Labels from Radiology Reports
  for Glioma Change Detection",2022-10-18T09:15:27Z,"Tommaso Di Noto, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Chirine Atat, Eduardo Gamito Teiga, Monika Hegi, Andreas Hottinger, Patric Hagmann, Jonas Richiardi","Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors in adults. Glioma change
detection aims at finding the relevant parts of the image that change over
time. Although Deep Learning (DL) shows promising performances in similar
change detection tasks, the creation of large annotated datasets represents a
major bottleneck for supervised DL applications in radiology. To overcome this,
we propose a combined use of weak labels (imprecise, but fast-to-create
annotations) and Transfer Learning (TL). Specifically, we explore inductive TL,
where source and target domains are identical, but tasks are different due to a
label shift: our target labels are created manually by three radiologists,
whereas our source weak labels are generated automatically from radiology
reports via NLP. We frame knowledge transfer as hyperparameter optimization,
thus avoiding heuristic choices that are frequent in related works. We
investigate the relationship between model size and TL, comparing a
low-capacity VGG with a higher-capacity ResNeXt model. We evaluate our models
on 1693 T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging difference maps created from 183
patients, by classifying them into stable or unstable according to tumor
evolution. The weak labels extracted from radiology reports allowed us to
increase dataset size more than 3-fold, and improve VGG classification results
from 75% to 82% AUC. Mixed training from scratch led to higher performance than
fine-tuning or feature extraction. To assess generalizability, we ran inference
on an open dataset (BraTS-2015: 15 patients, 51 difference maps), reaching up
to 76% AUC. Overall, results suggest that medical imaging problems may benefit
from smaller models and different TL strategies with respect to computer vision
datasets, and that report-generated weak labels are effective in improving
model performances. Code, in-house dataset and BraTS labels are released.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09698v2

Quantum oscillations of Kondo screening phases in strong magnetic fields,2022-11-01T07:55:12Z,"Po-Hao Chou, Chung-Hou Chung, Chung-Yu Mou","We generalize the iterative diagonalization procedure adopted in method of
numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in strong magnetic
fields, where the density of states for itinerary electrons at the chemical
potential varies discontinuously as the magnetic field changes. We first
examine phases of many-body ground states in the presence of single impurity.
By investigating change of $z$-component of total spin, $\Delta S_z$, and
spin-spin correlation between the impurity and conduction electrons, we find
that there are three states competing for the ground state when Zeeman
splitting is present. One of the states is doublet in which the impurity spin
is unscreened. The other two states are Kondo screening states with $\Delta
S_z=1/2$ and $\Delta S_z=1$, in which the impurity spin is partially screened
and completely screened respectively. For Kondo systems with two-impurities in
strong magnetic fields, we find that the interplay between the Kondo screening
effect, RKKY interaction, and quantum oscillations due to Landau levels
determines the ground state of the system. Combination of these three factors
results in different screening scenarios for different phases in which spins of
two impurities can form spin-0 or spin-1 states, while impurity spins in these
phases can be either screened, partially screened, or unscreened by conduction
electrons. The emergence of the ground state from these competing states
oscillates with the change of magnetic field, chemical potential or
inter-impurity distance. This leads to quantum oscillations in magnetization
and conductivity. In particular, we find extra peak structures in longitudinal
conductivity that reflect changes of Kondo screening phases and are important
features to be observed in experiments. Our results provide a complete
characterization of phases for Kondo effect in strong magnetic fields.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00318v2

stellar explosion in 2002, leaving behind an expanding cool supergiant and a
hot B3V companion. Five years after the outburst, the B3V companion disappeared
from view, and so far did not recover. Aims. We investigate the changes in the
light curve and spectral features Methods. A monitoring campaign has been
performed during the past 13 years with the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain
optical photometric and spectroscopic data. The data sets are used to analyse
the temporal evolution of the spectral features and the spectral energy
distribution, and to characterize the object. Results. Our photometric data
show a steady brightening in all bands during the past 13 years, which is
particularly prominent in the blue. This rise is also reflected in the spectra,
showing a gradual relative increase in the continuum flux at shorter
wavelengths. In addition, a slow brightening of the Ha emission line starting
in 2015 was detected. These changes might imply that the B3V companion is
slowly reappearing. During the same time interval, our analysis reveals a
considerable change in the observed colours of the object along with a steady
decrease in the strength and width of molecular absorption bands in our
low-resolution spectra. These changes suggest a rising temperature of the cool
supergiant along with a weakening of its wind, most likely combined with a slow
recovery of the secondary due to the evaporation of the dust and accretion of
the material from the shell in which the hot companion is embedded. From our
medium-resolution spectra, we find that the heliocentric radial velocity of the
atomic absorption line of TiI 6556.06 A has been stable for more than a decade.
We propose that TiI lines are tracing the velocity of the red supergiant in

"APT: Adaptive Perceptual quality based camera Tuning using reinforcement
  learning",2022-11-15T21:02:48Z,"Sibendu Paul, Kunal Rao, Giuseppe Coviello, Murugan Sankaradas, Oliver Po, Y. Charlie Hu, Srimat Chakradhar","Cameras are increasingly being deployed in cities, enterprises and roads
world-wide to enable many applications in public safety, intelligent
transportation, retail, healthcare and manufacturing. Often, after initial
deployment of the cameras, the environmental conditions and the scenes around
these cameras change, and our experiments show that these changes can adversely
impact the accuracy of insights from video analytics. This is because the
camera parameter settings, though optimal at deployment time, are not the best
settings for good-quality video capture as the environmental conditions and
scenes around a camera change during operation. Capturing poor-quality video
adversely affects the accuracy of analytics. To mitigate the loss in accuracy
of insights, we propose a novel, reinforcement-learning based system APT that
dynamically, and remotely (over 5G networks), tunes the camera parameters, to
ensure a high-quality video capture, which mitigates any loss in accuracy of
video analytics. As a result, such tuning restores the accuracy of insights
when environmental conditions or scene content change. APT uses reinforcement
learning, with no-reference perceptual quality estimation as the reward
function. We conducted extensive real-world experiments, where we
simultaneously deployed two cameras side-by-side overlooking an enterprise
parking lot (one camera only has manufacturer-suggested default setting, while
the other camera is dynamically tuned by APT during operation). Our experiments
demonstrated that due to dynamic tuning by APT, the analytics insights are
consistently better at all times of the day: the accuracy of object detection
video analytics application was improved on average by ~ 42%. Since our reward
function is independent of any analytics task, APT can be readily used for
different video analytics tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08504v1

in the electronic structure of Cr-doped VO2 films coherently grown on TiO2
(001) substrates. The electronic phase diagram of CrxV1-xO2 is drawn by a
combination of electric and spectroscopic measurements. The phase diagram is
similar to that of bulk CrxV1-xO2, while the temperature of metal-insulator
transition (TMIT) is significantly suppressed by the epitaxial strain effect.
In the range of x = 0-0.04, where TMIT remains unchanged as a function of x,
the PES spectra show dramatic change across TMIT, demonstrating the
characteristic spectral changes associated with the Peierls phenomenon. In
contrast, for x > 0.04, the TMIT linearly increases, and the metal-insulator
transition (MIT) may disappear at x = 0.08-0.12. The PES spectra at x = 0.08
exhibit pseudogap behavior near the Fermi level, whereas the characteristic
temperature-induced change remains almost intact, suggesting the existence of
local V-V dimerization. The suppression of V-V dimerization with increasing x
was confirmed by polarization-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy. These
spectroscopic investigations reveal that the energy gap and V 3d states are
essentially unchanged with 0 $\le$ x $\le$ 0.08 despite the suppression of V-V
dimerization. The invariance of the energy gap with respect to x suggests that
the MIT in CrxV1-xO2 arises primarily from the strong electron correlations,
namely the Peierls-assisted Mott transition. Meanwhile, the pseudogap at x =
0.08 eventually evolves to a full gap (Mott gap) at x = 0.12, which is
consistent with the disappearance of the temperature-dependent MIT in the
electronic phase diagram. These results demonstrate that a Mott insulating
phase without V-V dimerization is stabilized at x > 0.08 as a result of the
superiority of Mott instability over the Peierls one.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14146v1

apparent types between types 1 and 2, usually accompanied by a drastic change
in their luminosity on timescales of years. However, it is still unclear
whether materials in broad-line regions (BLRs) in CLAGNs appear and disappear
during the type-transition or remain at the same location while the line
production is simply activated or deactivated. Here we present our
X-ray-optical monitoring results of a CLAGN, NGC 3516, by Suzaku, Swift, and
ground telescopes, with our primary focus on the narrow Fe-K$\alpha$ emission
line, which is an effective probe of the BLR materials. We detected significant
variations of the narrow Fe-K$\alpha$ line on a timescale of tens of days
during the type-2 (faint) phase in 2013-2014, and conducted ""narrow
Fe-K$\alpha$ reverberation mapping,"" comparing its flux variation with those of
the X-ray continuum from a corona and $B$-band continuum from an accretion
disk. We derived, as a result, a time lag of $10.1^{+5.8}_{-5.6}$ days
($1\sigma$ errors) for the Fe-K$\alpha$ line behind the continuum, which is
consistent with the location of the BLR determined in optical spectroscopic
reverberation mapping during the type-1 (bright) phase. This finding shows that
the BLR materials remained at the same location without emitting optical
broad-lines during the type-2 phase. Considering the drastic decrease of the
radiation during the type-transition, our result is possibly inconsistent with
the hotly-discussed formation models of the BLR which propose that the
radiative pressure from an accretion disk should be the main driving force.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02731v1

Acta were legal documents in which witnesses were listed in order of social
status. Any bishops present were listed as a group. For our purposes, each
witness-list is an ordered permutation of bishop names with a known date or
date-range. Changes over time in the order bishops are listed may reflect
changes in their authority. Historians would like to detect and quantify these
changes. There is no reason to assume that the underlying social order which
constrains bishop-order within lists is a complete order. We therefore model
the evolving social order as an evolving partial ordered set or {\it poset}.
  We construct a Hidden Markov Model for these data. The hidden state is an
evolving poset (the evolving social hierarchy) and the emitted data are random
total orders (dated lists) respecting the poset present at the time the order
was observed. This generalises existing models for rank-order data such as
Mallows and Plackett-Luce. We account for noise via a random ``queue-jumping''
process. Our latent-variable prior for the random process of posets is
marginally consistent. A parameter controls poset depth and actor-covariates
inform the position of actors in the hierarchy. We fit the model, estimate
posets and find evidence for changes in status over time. We interpret our

Daniel Wang, Jing Wang, Theresa Wiegert, Yun Zheng","The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents the cool/warm ionized
gas reservoir around galaxies. We present a spatial analysis of H$\alpha$
images of 22 nearby edge-on spiral galaxies from the CHANG-ES sample (the
eDIG-CHANGES project), taken with the APO 3.5m telescope, in order to study
their eDIG. We conduct an exponential fit to the vertical intensity profiles of
the sample galaxies, of which 16 can be decomposed into a thin disk plus an
extended thick disk component. The median value of the scale height (h) of the
extended component is $1.13\pm 0.14$ kpc. We find a tight sublinear correlation
between h and the SFR. Moreover, the offset of individual galaxies from the
best-fit SFR-h relation shows significant anti-correlation with SFR_SD. This
indicates that galaxies with more intense star formation tend to have
disproportionately extended eDIG. Combined with data from the literature, we
find that the correlations between the eDIG properties and the galaxies'
properties extend to broader ranges. We further compare the vertical extension
of the eDIG to multi-wavelength measurements of other CGM phases. We find the
eDIG to be slightly more extended than the neutral gas (HI 21-cm line),
indicating the existence of some extended ionizing sources. Most galaxies have
an X-ray scale height smaller than the h, suggesting that the majority of the
X-ray emission detected in shallow observations are actually from the thick
disk. The h is comparable to the L-band radio continuum scale height, both
slightly larger than that at higher frequencies (C-band), where the cooling is
stronger and the thermal contribution may be larger. The comparable H$\alpha$
and L-band scale height indicates that the thermal and non-thermal electrons
have similar spatial distributions. This further indicates that the thermal
gas, the cosmics rays, and the magnetic field may be close to energy
equipartition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14824v1
"Critical crossover phenomena driven by symmetry-breaking defects at

transitions (CQTs), which may arise from localized external fields coupled to
the order-parameter operator. The problem is addressed within
renormalization-group (RG) and finite-size scaling frameworks. We consider the
paradigmatic one-dimensional quantum Ising models at their CQT, in the presence
of defects which break the global ${\mathbb Z}_2$ symmetry. We show that such
defects can give rise to notable critical crossover regimes where the
ground-state properties experience substantial and rapid changes, from
symmetric conditions to symmetry-breaking boundaries. An effective
characterization of these crossover phenomena driven by defects is achieved by
analyzing the ground-state fidelity associated with small changes of the defect
strength. Within the critical crossover regime, the fidelity susceptibility
shows a power-law divergence when increasing the system size, related to the RG
dimension of the defect strength; in contrast, outside the critical defect
regime, it remains finite. We support the RG scaling arguments with numerical
results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00390v1

"Asynchronism and nonequilibrium phase transitions in $(1+1)$D quantum
  cellular automata",2022-01-05T11:59:07Z,"Edward Gillman, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky","Probabilistic cellular automata provide a simple framework for the
exploration of classical nonequilibrium processes. Recently, quantum cellular
automata have been proposed that rely on the propagation of a one-dimensional
quantum state along a fictitious discrete time dimension via the sequential
application of quantum gates. The resulting $(1+1)$-dimensional space-time
structure makes these automata special cases of feed-forward quantum neural
networks. Here we show how asynchronism -- introduced via non-commuting gates
-- impacts on the collective nonequilibrium behavior of quantum cellular
automata. We illustrate this through a simple model, whose synchronous version
implements a contact process and features a nonequilibrium phase transition in
the directed percolation universality class. Non-commuting quantum gates lead
to an ""asynchronism transition"", i.e. a sudden qualitative change in the phase
transition behavior once a certain degree of asynchronicity is surpassed. Our
results show how quantum effects may lead to abrupt changes of non-equilibrium

Chiral edge soliton in nonlinear Chern systems,2022-01-06T02:01:58Z,Motohiko Ezawa,"We study the effect on the chiral edge states by including a nonlinearity to
a Chern insulator which has two chiral edge states with opposite chiralities.
We explore a quench dynamics by giving a pulse to one site on an edge and
analyzing the time evolution of a wave packet. Without the nonlinearity, an
initial pulse spreads symmetrically and diffuses. On the other hand, with the
nonlinearity present, a solitary wave is formed by the self-trapping effect of
the nonlinear term and undergoes a unidirectional propagation along the edge,
which we identify as a chiral edge soliton. A further increase of the
nonlinearity induces a self-trapping transition, where the chiral wave packet
stops its motion. It is intriguing that the nonlinearity is controlled only by
changing the initial condition without changing a sample.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01891v1

"Applying Word Embeddings to Measure Valence in Information Operations
  Targeting Journalists in Brazil",2022-01-06T21:52:20Z,David A. Broniatowski,"Among the goals of information operations are to change the overall
information environment vis-\'a-vis specific actors. For example, ""trolling
campaigns"" seek to undermine the credibility of specific public figures,
leading others to distrust them and intimidating these figures into silence. To
accomplish these aims, information operations frequently make use of ""trolls""
-- malicious online actors who target verbal abuse at these figures. In Brazil,
in particular, allies of Brazil's current president have been accused of
operating a ""hate cabinet"" -- a trolling operation that targets journalists who
have alleged corruption by this politician and other members of his regime.
Leading approaches to detecting harmful speech, such as Google's Perspective

approach is helpful in identifying content to downrank, flag, or remove, it is
known to be brittle, and may miss attempts to introduce more subtle biases into

Unconditional Effects of General Policy Interventions,2022-01-07T01:56:49Z,"Julian Martinez-Iriarte, Gabriel Montes-Rojas, Yixiao Sun","This paper studies the unconditional effects of a general policy
intervention, which includes location-scale shifts and simultaneous shifts as
special cases. The location-scale shift is intended to study a counterfactual
policy aimed at changing not only the mean or location of a covariate but also
its dispersion or scale. The simultaneous shift refers to the situation where
shifts in two or more covariates take place simultaneously. For example, a
shift in one covariate is compensated at a certain rate by a shift in another
covariate. Not accounting for these possible scale or simultaneous shifts will
result in an incorrect assessment of the potential policy effects on an outcome
variable of interest. The unconditional policy parameters are estimated with
simple semiparametric estimators, for which asymptotic properties are studied.
Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to study their finite sample
performances. The proposed approach is applied to a Mincer equation to study
the effects of changing years of education on wages and to study the effect of

Bayesian Neural Networks for Reversible Steganography,2022-01-07T14:56:33Z,Ching-Chun Chang,"Recent advances in deep learning have led to a paradigm shift in the field of
reversible steganography. A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is
predictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However,
non-trivial errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy
data. In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive
models based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby
creating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models
are regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing
to provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a
probabilistic perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware
intelligent machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To
quantify uncertainty, we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive
distribution and approximate it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic
forward passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled
into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt
unsupervised. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement delivered by
Bayesian uncertainty analysis upon steganographic rate-distortion performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02478v2

space of initial value fields for Einstein's equations. The bracket relations
in this algebra are precisely those of the constraints for the initial value

algebroid in which the algebra consists of sections of a sheaf rather than a
vector bundle. (An actual Lie algebroid had been previously constructed by
Blohmann, Fernandes, and Weinstein over a much larger extension.) The
construction uses the BV-BFV (Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky) approach to boundary
value problems, starting with the Einstein equations themselves, to construct
an $L_\infty$-algebroid over a graded manifold which extends the initial data.
The Lie-Rinehart algebra is then constructed by a change of variables. One of
the consequences of the BV-BFV approach is a proof that the coisotropic
property of the constraint set follows from the invariance of the Einstein

misogyny. Women are less likely to be associated with desirable traits (i.e.,
competence), and while this bias has decreased, it persists. Ancillary analyses
further suggest that song lyrics may help drive shifts in societal stereotypes
towards women, and that lyrical shifts are driven by male artists (as female

Deep clustering with fusion autoencoder,2022-01-11T07:38:03Z,Shuai Chang,"Embracing the deep learning techniques for representation learning in
clustering research has attracted broad attention in recent years, yielding a
newly developed clustering paradigm, viz. the deep clustering (DC). Typically,
the DC models capitalize on autoencoders to learn the intrinsic features which
facilitate the clustering process in consequence. Nowadays, a generative model
named variational autoencoder (VAE) has got wide acceptance in DC studies.
Nevertheless, the plain VAE is insufficient to perceive the comprehensive
latent features, leading to the deteriorative clustering performance. In this
paper, a novel DC method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, the

for Martian years 28 and 34 reveal details of the water ""pump"" mechanism and
the role of gravity wave (GW) forcing. Water is advected to the upper
atmosphere mainly by upward branches of the meridional circulation: in low
latitudes during equinoxes and over the south pole during solstices. Molecular
diffusion plays little role in water transport in the middle atmosphere and
across the mesopause. GWs modulate the circulation and temperature during
global dust storms, thus changing the timing and intensity of the transport. At
equinoxes, they facilitate water accumulation in the polar warming regions in
the middle atmosphere followed by stronger upwelling over the equator. As
equinoctial storms decay, GWs tend to accelerate the reduction of water in the
thermosphere. GWs delay the onset of the transport during solstitial storms and
change the globally averaged amount of water in the upper atmosphere by 10-25%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05081v1

solution, we can approximate the non-linear stochastic population process by a
linear birth-death process where the interactions are frozen, as long as the
population remains close to this equilibrium. This allows us to derive, when
the population is large, the equation satisfied by the ancestral lineage of an
individual uniformly sampled at a fixed time $T$, which is the path constituted
of the traits of the ancestors of this individual in past times $t\leq T$. This
process is a time inhomogeneous Markov process, but we show that the time

dimension, carry protected edge modes only when the bulk is a gapless Luttinger
liquid. The edge modes of such a topological Luttinger liquid (TLL) descend
from a nonlocal string order that is forbidden in gapped phases and whose
precise form depends on the symmetry class of the system. In this work, we
propose a powerful and unbiased entanglement-based smoking gun signature of the
TLL. In particular, we show that the entanglement entropy profile of a TLL
lacks Friedel oscillations that are invariably present in other gapless one
dimensional phases such as ordinary Luttinger liquids, and argue that their
absence is closely related to a long-ranged string order which is an intrinsic
property of the TLL. Crucially, such a diagnostic is more robust against

latent subspace semantics by exploiting existing face analysis models, e.g.,
face parsers and face landmark detectors. These models provide the flexibility
to construct various criterions with very concrete and interpretable semantic
meanings (e.g., change face shape or change skin color) to restrict latent
subspace disentanglement. Rich latent space controls unknown previously can be
discovered using the constructed criterions. Second, we propose a new
perspective to explain the behavior of a CNN classifier by generating
counterfactuals in the interpretable latent subspaces we discovered. This
explanation helps reveal whether the classifier learns semantics as intended.

Recency Dropout for Recurrent Recommender Systems,2022-01-26T15:50:20Z,"Bo Chang, Can Xu, Matthieu Lê, Jingchen Feng, Ya Le, Sriraj Badam, Ed Chi, Minmin Chen","Recurrent recommender systems have been successful in capturing the temporal
dynamics in users' activity trajectories. However, recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) are known to have difficulty learning long-term dependencies. As a
consequence, RNN-based recommender systems tend to overly focus on short-term
user interests. This is referred to as the recency bias, which could negatively
affect the long-term user experience as well as the health of the ecosystem. In
this paper, we introduce the recency dropout technique, a simple yet effective
data augmentation technique to alleviate the recency bias in recurrent
recommender systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of recency dropout in
various experimental settings including a simulation study, offline

in theoretical neuroscience. Recently developed reduction methods make it
possible to derive such models directly from the microscopic dynamics of
individual neurons. To simplify the reduction, the Cauchy distribution is
usually assumed for heterogeneous network parameters. Here we extend the
reduction method for a wider class of heterogeneities defined by the
$q$-Gaussian distribution. The shape of this distribution depends on the
Tsallis index $q$ and gradually changes from the Cauchy distribution to the
normal Gaussian distribution as this index changes. We derive the mean-field
equations for an inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons
with a $q$-Gaussian distributed excitability parameter. It is shown that the
dynamic modes of the network significantly depend on the form of the

The China Trade Shock and the ESG Performances of US firms,2022-01-28T20:25:31Z,"Hui Xu, Yue Wu","How does import competition from China affect engagement on ESG initiatives
by US corporates? On the one hand, reduced profitability due to import
competition and lagging ESG performance of Chinese exporters can disincentivize
US firms to put more resources to ESG initiatives. On the other hand, the shift
from labor-intensive production to capital/technology-intensive production
along with offshoring may improve the US company's ESG performance. Moreover,
US companies have incentives to actively pursue more ESG engagement to
differentiate from Chinese imports. Exploiting a trade policy in which US
congress granted China the Permanent Normal Trade Relations and the resulting
change in expected tariff rates on Chinese imports, we find that greater import
competition from China leads to an increase in the US company's ESG
performance. The improvement primarily stems from ""doing more positives"" and
from more involvement on environmental initiatives. Indirect and direct
evidence shows that the improvement is not driven by the change in production
process or offshoring, but is consistent with product differentiation. Our
results suggest that the trade shock from China has significant impact on the

Adversarial Attack (SI-PGD), which utilizes the angle between the features in
the penultimate layer and the weights in the softmax layer to guide the
generation of adversaries. The cosine angle matrix is used to learn angularly
discriminative representation and will not be changed with the rescaling of

Anticipation-Free Training for Simultaneous Machine Translation,2022-01-30T16:29:37Z,"Chih-Chiang Chang, Shun-Po Chuang, Hung-yi Lee","Simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) speeds up the translation process
by starting to translate before the source sentence is completely available. It
is difficult due to limited context and word order difference between
languages. Existing methods increase latency or introduce adaptive read-write
policies for SimulMT models to handle local reordering and improve translation
quality. However, the long-distance reordering would make the SimulMT models
learn translation mistakenly. Specifically, the model may be forced to predict
target tokens when the corresponding source tokens have not been read. This
leads to aggressive anticipation during inference, resulting in the
hallucination phenomenon. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new framework
that decompose the translation process into the monotonic translation step and
the reordering step, and we model the latter by the auxiliary sorting network
(ASN). The ASN rearranges the hidden states to match the order in the target
language, so that the SimulMT model could learn to translate more reasonably.
The entire model is optimized end-to-end and does not rely on external aligners

Nonlinear deformation and elasticity of BCC refractory metals and alloys,2022-02-02T14:47:31Z,"Vishnu Raghuraman, Michael Widom, Michael C. Gao","Application of isotropic pressure or uniaxial strain alters the elastic
properties of materials; sufficiently large strains can drive structural
transformations. Linear elasticity describes stability against infinitesimal

refractory metals and alloys towards mechanical instabilities. These include an
extensional instability, and a symmetry-breaking orthorhombic distortion caused
by a Jahn-Teller-Peierls instability that splays the cubic lattice vectors.
Here, we analyze these transitions in depth. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
the Wallace tensor identify and classify linear instabilities in the presence
of strain. We show that both instabilities are discontinuous, leading to
discrete jumps in the lattice parameters. We provide physical intuition for the
instabilities by analyzing the changes in first principles energy, stress, bond
lengths and angles upon application of strain. Electronic band structure

"Electric field screening in pair discharges and generation of pulsar
  radio emission",2022-02-02T21:48:59Z,"Elizabeth A. Tolman, Alexander A. Philippov, Andrey N. Timokhin","Pulsar radio emission may be generated in pair discharges which fill the
pulsar magnetosphere with plasma as an accelerating electric field is screened
by freshly created pairs. In this Letter we develop a simplified analytic
theory for the screening of the electric field in these pair discharges and use
it to estimate total radio luminosity and spectrum. The discharge has three
stages. First, the electric field is screened for the first time and starts to
oscillate. Next, a nonlinear phase occurs. In this phase, the amplitude of the
electric field experiences strong damping because the field dramatically
changes the momenta of newly created pairs. This strong damping ceases, and the
system enters a final linear phase, when the electric field can no longer
dramatically change pair momenta. Applied to pulsars, this theory may explain
several aspects of radio emission, including the observed luminosity,
$L_{\rm{rad}} \sim 10^{28} \rm{erg} \, \rm{s}^{-1}$, and the observed spectrum,
$S_\omega \sim \omega^{-1.4 \pm 1.0} $.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01303v2

Spectro Temporal EEG Biomarkers For Binary Emotion Classification,2022-02-02T10:08:22Z,"Upasana Tiwari, Rupayan Chakraborty, Sunil Kumar Kopparapu","Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most reliable physiological signal

understanding of IH by introducing a new physical quantity, the IH admixture
ratio ${\alpha}$. Consequently, an exotic strategy of IH engineering in energy
space can be proposed, i.e., instead of changing t as commonly used, ${\alpha}$
can be effectively tuned in energy space by changing the onsite energy
difference ($2{\Delta}$) between neighboring-layer states. In practice, this is
feasible via reshaping the electrostatic potential of the surface by deposing a
dipolar overlayer, e.g., crystalline ice. Our first-principles calculations
unveil that IH engineering via adjusting $2{\Delta}$ can greatly tune
interlayer optical transitions in transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers,
switch different types of Dirac surface states in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films, and

MaskGIT: Masked Generative Image Transformer,2022-02-08T23:54:06Z,"Huiwen Chang, Han Zhang, Lu Jiang, Ce Liu, William T. Freeman","Generative transformers have experienced rapid popularity growth in the
computer vision community in synthesizing high-fidelity and high-resolution
images. The best generative transformer models so far, however, still treat an
image naively as a sequence of tokens, and decode an image sequentially
following the raster scan ordering (i.e. line-by-line). We find this strategy
neither optimal nor efficient. This paper proposes a novel image synthesis
paradigm using a bidirectional transformer decoder, which we term MaskGIT.
During training, MaskGIT learns to predict randomly masked tokens by attending
to tokens in all directions. At inference time, the model begins with
generating all tokens of an image simultaneously, and then refines the image
iteratively conditioned on the previous generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that MaskGIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer model

clarify that this complex absorption change consists of the two following
components: (i) the decrease in the photoabsorption in a narrow energy range
around the $M_{2,3}$ edge, which reflects the blue shift of the absorption edge
due to the light-induced demagnetization, and (ii) the increase in the
photoabsorption in a wider range around the $M_{2,3}$ edge, which reflects the

perovskite tolerance factor plays a crucial role in the lattice dynamics and
ground-state structure of the perovskite monolayers and bilayers, thus
providing an important indicator for screening this hybrid improper
ferroelectricity. Generally, the ferroelectric switching via an orthorhombic
twin state has the lowest energy barrier. Epitaxial strain can effectively tune
the ferroelectric polarization and ferroelectric switching by changing the
amplitude of octahedral rotation and tilt distortion. The increasing
compressive strain causes a polar to nonpolar phase transition by suppressing
the tilt distortion. The cooperative effect of octahedral distortion at the
interface with the substrate can reduce the energy barrier of the reversing
rotation mode and can even change the lowest-energy ferroelectric switching
path.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04343v2

detects semantic objects and establishes correspondences of those objects
between images. Object correspondences provide local coarse alignment of the
images in the form of a planar homography. These homographies are consequently
used to guide the matching of local features. Experiments on standard urban
localization datasets (Aachen, Extended-CMU-Season, RobotCar-Season) show that

net locomotion. Small devices designed for biomimetic locomotion need to
exploit flows that are not symmetric in time (non-reciprocal) to escape the
constraints of the scallop theorem and undergo net motion. Unlike other
biological slender swimmers, the non-reciprocal bending of the gel centreline
is not sufficient here to explain for the overall swimming motion. We show
instead that the swimming of the gel results from the flux of water
periodically emanating from (or entering) the gel itself due to its shrinking

thermal-viscous instability (TVI) for at least part of the time. The time
fraction spent in the high state or the outbursts dramatically changed on the
timescale of decades. Highly variable brightness of V1363 Cyg displayed several
episodes of a strong brightening (bumps in the light curve) from a cool disk in
the TVI zone. In the interpretation, their vastly discrepant decay rates show
that only some of these bumps can be attributed to the dwarf nova outbursts
without strong irradiation of the disk by the hot white dwarf. The Bailey
relation of the decay rate, if ascribed to a DN outburst of V1363 Cyg, speaks
in favor of its orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$ very long for a CV, about 20-40
hr. A dominant cycle length of about 435 d was present in the brightness
changes all the time, even when the disk was well inside the TVI zone. We

Why just FRET when you can Refactor? Retuning FRETISH Requirements,2022-02-11T18:25:28Z,"Matt Luckcuck, Marie Farrell, Oisín Sheridan","Formal verification of a software system relies on formalising the
requirements to which it should adhere, which can be challenging. While
formalising requirements from natural-language, we have dependencies that lead
to duplication of information across many requirements, meaning that a change
to one requirement causes updates in several places. We propose to adapt code
refactorings for NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), our
tool-of-choice. Refactoring is the process of reorganising software to improve
its internal structure without altering its external behaviour; it can also be
applied to requirements, to make them more manageable by reducing repetition.
FRET automatically translates requirements (written in its input language
Fretish) into Temporal Logic, which enables us to formally verify that
refactoring has preserved the requirements' underlying meaning. In this paper,
we present four refactorings for Fretish requirements and explain their
utility. We describe the application of one of these refactorings to the
requirements of a civilian aircraft engine software controller, to decouple the

"FrAUG: A Frame Rate Based Data Augmentation Method for Depression
  Detection from Speech Signals",2022-02-11T21:37:22Z,"Vijay Ravi, Jinhan Wang, Jonathan Flint, Abeer Alwan","In this paper, a data augmentation method is proposed for depression
detection from speech signals. Samples for data augmentation were created by
changing the frame-width and the frame-shift parameters during the feature
extraction process. Unlike other data augmentation methods (such as VTLP, pitch
perturbation, or speed perturbation), the proposed method does not explicitly
change acoustic parameters but rather the time-frequency resolution of
frame-level features. The proposed method was evaluated using two different
datasets, models, and input acoustic features. For the DAIC-WOZ (English)
dataset when using the DepAudioNet model and mel-Spectrograms as input, the
proposed method resulted in an improvement of 5.97% (validation) and 25.13%
(test) when compared to the baseline. The improvements for the CONVERGE
(Mandarin) dataset when using the x-vector embeddings with CNN as the backend
and MFCCs as input features were 9.32% (validation) and 12.99% (test). Baseline
systems do not incorporate any data augmentation. Further, the proposed method
outperformed commonly used data-augmentation methods such as noise
augmentation, VTLP, Speed, and Pitch Perturbation. All improvements were
statistically significant.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05912v1
"Entangled two-photon absorption detection through a Hong-Ou-Mandel
  interferometer",2022-02-12T05:00:11Z,"Freiman Triana-Arango, Gabriel Ramos-Ortiz, Roberto Ramírez-Alarcón","Recently, different experimental methods to investigate the entangled
two-photon absorption (ETPA) process in a variety of materials have been
reported. The present work reports on a different approach on which the ETPA
process is detected based on the changes induced on the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM)
interferogram of two photons produced by a spontaneous parametric down
conversion (SPDC) Type-II process. Using an organic solution of the laser dye
Rhodamine B as a model, it is demonstrated that ETPA at 800nm can be monitored
by the changes in the temporal-width and visibility of the HOM interferogram
produced by the photons at a beam splitter after interacting with the sample.
Additionally, we present a detail model in which the sample is modeled as a
filtering function which fullfills the energy conservation conditions required
by ETPA, allowing to explain the experimental observations with excellent
agreement. We believe that this work represents a new perspective to study the
ETPA process, by using an ultra-sensitive quantum interference technique and a
detailed mathematical model of the process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05985v1
String Stars in Anti de Sitter Space,2022-02-14T19:00:01Z,Erez Y. Urbach,"We study the `string star' saddle, also known as the Horowitz-Polchinski
solution, in the middle of d+1 dimensional thermal AdS space. We show that
there's a regime of temperatures in which the saddle is very similar to the
flat space solution found by Horowitz and Polchinski. This saddle is
hypothetically connected at lower temperatures to the small AdS black hole
saddle. We also study, numerically and analytically, how the solutions are
changed due to the AdS geometry for higher temperatures. Specifically, we
describe how the solution joins with the thermal gas phase, and find the
leading correction to the Hagedorn temperature due to the AdS curvature.
Finally, we study the thermodynamic instabilities of the solution and argue for

to the redistribution of local quantum geometry. Whereas, probing the local
quantum geometry in non-centrosymmetric topological material remains

Limits on the Evolutionary Rates of Biological Traits,2022-02-15T16:05:37Z,Luis Pedro García-Pintos,"This paper focuses on the maximum speed at which biological evolution can
occur. I derive inequalities that limit the rate of evolutionary processes
driven by natural selection, mutations, or genetic drift. These \emph{rate
limits} link the variability in a population to evolutionary rates. In
particular, high variances in the fitness of a population and of a quantitative
trait allow for fast changes in the trait's average. In contrast, low
variability makes a trait less susceptible to random changes due to genetic
drift. The results in this article generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of
natural selection to dynamics that allow for mutations and genetic drift, via
trade-off relations that constrain the evolutionary rates of arbitrary traits.
The rate limits can be used to probe questions in various evolutionary biology
and ecology settings. They apply, for instance, to trait dynamics within or
across species or to the evolution of bacteria strains. They apply to any
quantitative trait, e.g., from species' weights to the lengths of DNA strands.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07533v4

  Fluorescent Protein",2022-02-15T16:09:50Z,"Harpreet Kaur, Khanh Nguyen, Pradeep Kumar","We have studied the effect of high hydrostatic pressure and temperature on
the steady state fluorescence anisotropy of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). We
find that the fluorescence anisotropy of GFP at a constant temperature

decreases with increasing temperature but exhibits a maximum with temperature
for pressure larger than 20 MPa. The temperature corresponding to the maximum
of anisotropy increases with increasing pressure. By taking into account of the
rotational correlation time changes of GFP with the pressure-temperature
dependent viscosity of the solvent, we argue that viscosity increase with
pressure is not a major contributing factor to the decrease in anisotropy with

  bottlenecks",2022-02-17T01:24:11Z,"Emanuele Crosato, Jeffrey N. Philippson, Shashi Thutupalli, Richard G. Morris","Since steep declines in a population's size also typically alter its
composition, population bottlenecks are considered highly important for
evolution. However, despite such significance, the mechanisms governing the
impact of a given population bottleneck remain poorly understood. In this
context, we show that long-term post-bottleneck outcomes can depend crucially
on the rate at which a diminished population grows whilst recovering. That is,
two otherwise identical populations, each having undergone the same bottleneck,
can fixate on dramatically different demographics due to different rates of
post-bottleneck growth. This behaviour is moreover shown to change
non-trivially with different levels of mutation. The underlying mechanism can
be traced to intrinsic fluctuations whose standard deviation decreases in time
with the inverse square root of the growing population size. Crucially, such
decreasing fluctuations couple to the underlying dynamics and result in
distinct regimes of (non-equilibrium) demographic behaviour, delimited by
abrupt transitions at critical population sizes. Seen through this lens, growth
and mutation alter evolutionary outcomes by changing the duration and character
of dynamical phases; a feature that we speculate may be of generic importance

Non-linear stiffness behavior of planar serial robotic manipulators,2022-02-17T14:51:02Z,"Wanda Zhao, Alexandr Klimchik, Anatol Pashkevich, Damien Chablat","The paper focuses on the stiffness analysis of multi-link serial planar

in the first case the loading may cause the buckling if it exceeds some
critical value, and the manipulator suddenly changes its straight shape and
stiffness properties. For computing this critical force, a general
eigenvalue-based technique was proposed that can be applied to any multi-link

interactions as dimension six operators in the SM EFT, identify pairs of them
giving interesting contributions to $\mu \to e$ processes, and obtain the
anomalous dimensions mixing those pairs into dimension eight $\mu\to e$

ESCAPE to Precaution against Leader Failures,2022-02-18T21:33:44Z,"Gengrui Zhang, Hans-Arno Jacobsen","Leader-based consensus protocols must undergo a view-change phase to elect a
new leader when the current leader fails. The new leader is often decided upon
a candidate server that collects votes from a quorum of servers. However,
voting-based election mechanisms intrinsically cause competition in leadership
candidacy when each candidate collects only partial votes. This split-vote
scenario can result in no leadership winner and prolong the undesired
view-change period. In this paper, we investigate a case study of Raft's leader
election mechanism and propose a new leader election protocol, called ESCAPE,
that fundamentally solves split votes by prioritizing servers based on their
log responsiveness. ESCAPE dynamically assigns servers with a configuration
that offers different priorities through Raft's periodic heartbeat. In each
assignment, ESCAPE keeps track of server log responsiveness and assigns
configurations that are inclined to win an election to more up-to-date servers,
thereby preparing a pool of prioritized candidates. Consequently, when the next
election takes place, the candidate with the highest priority will defeat its
counterparts and becomes the next leader without competition. The evaluation
results show that ESCAPE progressively reduces the leader election time when
the cluster scales up, and the improvement becomes more significant under
message loss.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09434v1

networks due to the intensive disturbances induced by the frequent merging,
weaving, and lane-changing behaviors. The Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
(CAVs), benefited from their capabilities of real-time communication and
precise motion control, hold an opportunity to promote ramp merging operation
through enhanced cooperation. The existing CAV cooperation strategies are
mainly designed for single-lane freeways, although multilane configurations are
more prevailing in the real-world. In this paper, we present a flow-level CAV
coordination strategy to facilitate merging operation in multilane freeways.
The coordination integrates lane-change rules between mainstream lanes,
proactive creation of large merging gaps, and platooning of ramp vehicles for
enhanced benefits in traffic flow stability and efficiency. The strategy is
formulated under an optimization framework, where the optimal control plan is
determined based on real-time traffic conditions. The impacts of tunable model
parameters on the produced control plan are discussed in detail. The efficiency
of the proposed multilane strategy is demonstrated in a micro-simulation

"Periodic temporal environmental variations induce coexistence in
  resource competition models",2022-02-23T17:10:03Z,"Tom Burkart, Jan Willeke, Erwin Frey","Natural ecosystems, in particular on the microbial scale, are inhabited by a
large number of species. The population size of each species is affected by
interactions of individuals with each other and by spatial and temporal changes
in environmental conditions, such as resource abundance. Here, we use a generic
population dynamics model to study how, and under what conditions, a periodic
temporal environmental variation can alter an ecosystem's composition and
biodiversity. We demonstrate that using time scale separation allows one to
qualitatively predict the long-term population dynamics of interacting species
in varying environments. We show that the notion of Tilman's R* rule, a
well-known principle that applies for constant environments, can be extended to
periodically varying environments if the time scale of environmental changes
(e.g., seasonal variations) is much faster than the time scale of population
growth (doubling time in bacteria). When these time scales are similar, our
analysis shows that a varying environment deters the system from reaching a
steady state, and stable coexistence between multiple species becomes possible.
Our results posit that biodiversity can in part be attributed to natural
environmental variations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11635v3

  Design for RIS-Assisted MISO Systems",2022-02-21T10:41:53Z,"Yuqian Zhu, Zhu Bo, Ming Li, Yang Liu, Qian Liu, Zheng Chang, Yulin Hu","Owing to the unique advantages of low cost and controllability,
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising candidate to address
the blockage issue in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems,

joint active beamforming and passive beamforming design is an arduous task due
to the high computational complexity and the dynamic changes of wireless

multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) mmWave system and aim to develop a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to jointly design active hybrid
beamformer at the base station (BS) side and passive beamformer at the RIS

maximum entropy based DRL algorithm, which can explore more stochastic policies
than deterministic policy, to design active analog precoder and passive
beamformer simultaneously. Then, the digital precoder is determined by minimum

Blind Reverberation Time Estimation in Dynamic Acoustic Conditions,2022-02-23T21:18:07Z,"Philipp Götz, Cagdas Tuna, Andreas Walther, Emanuël A. P. Habets","The estimation of reverberation time from real-world signals plays a central
role in a wide range of applications. In many scenarios, acoustic conditions

continuously. Previously proposed methods involving deep neural networks were
mostly designed and tested under the assumption of static acoustic conditions.
In this work, we show that these approaches can perform poorly in dynamically
evolving acoustic environments. Motivated by a recent trend towards

"Magnetic-field Induced Topological Transitions and Thermal Conductivity
  in a Generalized Kitaev Model",2022-02-24T19:01:51Z,"Heqiu Li, Yong Baek Kim, Hae-Young Kee","Recent experiments on Kitaev spin liquid candidate materials reported
non-monotonic behavior of thermal conductivity as a function of magnetic field,
which lead to conflicting interpretations of its origin. Motivated by this
development, we study the magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity of
a generalized Kitaev model, which allows the phase transitions between
different flux sectors as a function of the magnetic field. The thermal
conductivity due to Majorana fermions shows dip-bump structures as the magnetic
field increases, which is caused by either the transitions between different
flux sectors of Kitaev spin liquids or the topological transitions that change
the Majorana Chern number within the same flux sector. It is shown that the
change of Chern number is closely related to the four-Majorana-fermion
interaction induced by the magnetic field. The non-monotonic behavior in
thermal conductivity emerges at finite temperature, and it becomes weaker when
temperature decreases towards zero. Our model provides a generic mechanism for
the Kitaev spin liquids to develop non-monotonic magnetic-field dependence of
thermal conductivity while the detailed comparison to realistic materials
remains an open question for future investigation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12315v2
Modeling moving boundary value problems in electrochemical machining,2022-02-25T14:02:38Z,"Tim van der Velden, Stephan Ritzert, Stefanie Reese, Johanna Waimann","This work presents a new approach to efficiently model the cathode in the
moving boundary value problem of electrochemical machining. Until recently, the
process simulation with finite elements had the drawback of remeshing required
by the changing surface geometries. This disadvantage was overcome by a novel
model formulation for the anodic dissolution that utilizes effective material
parameters as well as the dissolution level as an internal variable and,
thereby, does not require remeshing. Now, we extend this concept to model
arbitrarily shaped and moving cathodes. Two methodologies are investigated to
describe the time varying position of the cathode. In the first approach, we
change the electric conductivity of elements within the cathode and, in a
second approach, we apply Dirichlet boundary conditions on the nodes of
corresponding elements. For both methods, elements on the cathode's surface are
treated with effective material parameters. This procedure allows for the
efficient simulation of industrially relevant, complex geometries without mesh
adaptation. The model's performance is validated by means of analytical,
numerical and experimental results from the literature. The short computation
times make the approach interesting for industrial applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12704v1
"Generalized Label Shift Correction via Minimum Uncertainty Principle:
  Theory and Algorithm",2022-02-26T02:39:47Z,"You-Wei Luo, Chuan-Xian Ren","As a fundamental problem in machine learning, dataset shift induces a
paradigm to learn and transfer knowledge under changing environment. Previous
methods assume the changes are induced by covariate, which is less practical
for complex real-world data. We consider the Generalized Label Shift (GLS),
which provides an interpretable insight into the learning and transfer of
desirable knowledge. Current GLS methods: 1) are not well-connected with the
statistical learning theory; 2) usually assume the shifting conditional
distributions will be matched with an implicit transformation, but its explicit
modeling is unexplored. In this paper, we propose a conditional adaptation
framework to deal with these challenges. From the perspective of learning
theory, we prove that the generalization error of conditional adaptation is
lower than previous covariate adaptation. Following the theoretical results, we
propose the minimum uncertainty principle to learn conditional invariant
transformation via discrepancy optimization. Specifically, we propose the
\textit{conditional metric operator} on Hilbert space to characterize the
distinctness of conditional distributions. For finite observations, we prove
that the empirical estimation is always well-defined and will converge to
underlying truth as sample size increases. The results of extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance under
different GLS scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13043v1

limit of Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics with speed change. The Kawasaki part

speeded up in a diffusive space-time scaling. The Glauber part governs the
creation and annihilation of particles. The Glauber part is set to favor two
levels of particle density. It is also speeded up in time, but at a lesser rate
than the Kawasaki part. Under this scaling, a mean-curvature interface flow
emerges, with a homogenized `surface tension-mobility' parameter reflecting
microscopic rates. The interface separates the two levels of particle density.
  Similar hydrodynamic limits have been derived in two recent papers; one where
the Kawasaki part describes simple nearest neighbor interactions, and one where
the Kawasaki part is replaced by a zero-range process. We extend the main
results of these two papers beyond nearest-neighbor interactions. The main

vary with time in the case of flares or for a precessing jet. In this work, we
want to explore the changes in core position as a function of frequency,
magnetic field alignment, relativistic electron density, and jet inclination
angle. We use a physical model of a synchrotron-emitting jet. Two cases of the
jet are analysed, namely with magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the
jet axis. The evolution of the related spectrum is monitored over the radio

extension of GTC to model the posteriors of both labels and label transitions

example application, we use the extended GTC (GTC-e) for the multi-speaker
speech recognition task. The transcriptions and speaker information of
multi-speaker speech are represented by a graph, where the speaker information
is associated with the transitions and ASR outputs with the nodes. Using GTC-e,
multi-speaker ASR modelling becomes very similar to single-speaker ASR

Dual Embodied-Symbolic Concept Representations for Deep Learning,2022-03-01T16:40:12Z,Daniel T. Chang,"Motivated by recent findings from cognitive neural science, we advocate the
use of a dual-level model for concept representations: the embodied level

concept representations, on the other hand, are amodal and language specific,
and exist in the form of word / knowledge-graph embeddings in a concept /

representations and symbolic representations, which typically interact to drive
conceptual processing. As such, we further advocate the use of dual

their usage and value, we discuss two important use cases: embodied-symbolic
knowledge distillation for few-shot class incremental learning, and
embodied-symbolic fused representation for image-text matching. Dual

Autoregressive based Drift Detection Method,2022-03-09T14:36:16Z,"Mansour Zoubeirou A Mayaki, Michel Riveill","In the classic machine learning framework, models are trained on historical
data and used to predict future values. It is assumed that the data
distribution does not change over time (stationarity). However, in real-world
scenarios, the data generation process changes over time and the model has to
adapt to the new incoming data. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and
leads to a decrease in the predictive model's performance. In this study, we
propose a new concept drift detection method based on autoregressive models
called ADDM. This method can be integrated into any machine learning algorithm
from deep neural networks to simple linear regression model. Our results show
that this new concept drift detection method outperforms the state-of-the-art
drift detection methods, both on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.
Our approach is theoretically guaranteed as well as empirical and effective for
the detection of various concept drifts. In addition to the drift detector, we

In-Place Rotation for Enhancing Snake-like Robot Mobility,2022-03-09T20:57:20Z,"Alexander H. Chang, Patricio A. Vela","Gaits engineered for snake-like robots to rotate in-place instrumentally fill
a gap in the set of locomotive gaits that have traditionally prioritized

ability of a shape-centric modeling framework to capture the gait's locomotive
properties. Shape modeling for turning involves a time-varying continuous body
curve described by a standing wave. Presumed viscous robot-ground frictional
interactions lead to body dynamics conditioned on the time-varying shape model.
The dynamic equations describing the Turn-in-Place gait are validated by an

model a variety of snake-like robot gaits with fundamentally different

organized in clusters that enhance its defect-induced electroluminescence. The
resulting emission occurs over a large continuum of wavelengths in the visible

interferences that develop within the device, making it possible to fabricate
LEDs with different colours by adjusting the thickness of their transparent

local density as well as the hexatic order parameter, we distinguish four
distinct dynamical states which include collapsed, active gas, dynamical
clustering, and motility-induced phase-separated states. The long-range
chemical field-induced interactions shift the onset of motility-induced phase

a suitable order parameter characterizing the dynamical phase transitions from
an active gas or dynamical clustering steady-state to a phase-separated state

features in groups of animals showing collective motion, such as schooling fish

introduced to define a large change, avalanches are characterized by
distributions of size and duration showing scale-free signatures, reminiscent
of self-organized critical behavior. We observe that avalanches are generally
triggered by a small number of fish, which act as effective leaders that induce
large rearrangements of the group's trajectory. This observation motivates the
proposal of a simple model, based in the classical Vicsek model of collective
motion, in which a given individual acts as a leader subject to random heading
reorientations. The model reproduces qualitatively the empirical avalanche

Single Loop Gaussian Homotopy Method for Non-convex Optimization,2022-03-11T02:05:27Z,"Hidenori Iwakiri, Yuhang Wang, Shinji Ito, Akiko Takeda","The Gaussian homotopy (GH) method is a popular approach to finding better
stationary points for non-convex optimization problems by gradually reducing a
parameter value $t$, which changes the problem to be solved from an almost
convex one to the original target one. Existing GH-based methods repeatedly
call an iterative optimization solver to find a stationary point every time $t$
is updated, which incurs high computational costs. We propose a novel single
loop framework for GH methods (SLGH) that updates the parameter $t$ and the
optimization decision variables at the same. Computational complexity analysis
is performed on the SLGH algorithm under various situations: either a gradient
or gradient-free oracle of a GH function can be obtained for both deterministic
and stochastic settings. The convergence rate of SLGH with a tuned
hyperparameter becomes consistent with the convergence rate of gradient
descent, even though the problem to be solved is gradually changed due to $t$.
In numerical experiments, our SLGH algorithms show faster convergence than an

single image is insufficient as it reveals only one facet of a 3D object. To
provide sufficient information for estimating a complete texture map, the
proposed model simultaneously generates multi-view hallucinations in the image
domain and an estimated texture map in the texture domain. During the
generating process, each domain generator exchanges features to the other by a
flow-based local attention mechanism. In this manner, the proposed model can
estimate a texture map utilizing abundant multi-view image features from which
multiview hallucinations are generated. As a result, the estimated texture map
contains consistent colors and patterns over the entire region. Experiments
show the superiority of our model for estimating a directly render-able texture

  Generation",2022-03-17T08:29:52Z,"Xiaoguang Chang, Teng Wang, Changyin Sun, Wenzhe Cai","Scene graph generation is a sophisticated task because there is no specific
recognition pattern (e.g., ""looking at"" and ""near"" have no conspicuous
difference concerning vision, whereas ""near"" could occur between entities with
different morphology). Thus some scene graph generation methods are trapped
into most frequent relation predictions caused by capricious visual features
and trivial dataset annotations. Therefore, recent works emphasized the
""unbiased"" approaches to balance predictions for a more informative scene
graph. However, human's quick and accurate judgments over relations between
numerous objects should be attributed to ""bias"" (i.e., experience and
linguistic knowledge) rather than pure vision. To enhance the model capability,
inspired by the ""cognitive bias"" mechanism, we propose a novel 3-paradigms
framework that simulates how humans incorporate the label linguistic features
as guidance of vision-based representations to better mine hidden relation
patterns and alleviate noisy visual propagation. Our framework is
model-agnostic to any scene graph model. Comprehensive experiments prove our
framework outperforms baseline modules in several metrics with minimum
parameters increment and achieves new SOTA performance on Visual Genome
dataset.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09160v1

On the Importance of Data Size in Probing Fine-tuned Models,2022-03-17T21:45:17Z,"Houman Mehrafarin, Sara Rajaee, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar","Several studies have investigated the reasons behind the effectiveness of
fine-tuning, usually through the lens of probing. However, these studies often
neglect the role of the size of the dataset on which the model is fine-tuned.
In this paper, we highlight the importance of this factor and its undeniable
role in probing performance. We show that the extent of encoded linguistic
knowledge depends on the number of fine-tuning samples. The analysis also
reveals that larger training data mainly affects higher layers, and that the
extent of this change is a factor of the number of iterations updating the
model during fine-tuning rather than the diversity of the training samples.
Finally, we show through a set of experiments that fine-tuning data size
affects the recoverability of the changes made to the model's linguistic
knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09627v1

"Efficient Estimation of the Additive Risks Model for Interval-Censored
  Data",2022-03-18T03:45:57Z,"Tong Wang, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay, Samiran Sinha","In contrast to the popular Cox model which presents a multiplicative
covariate effect specification on the time to event hazards, the semiparametric

allowing the estimation of both time-independent and time-varying covariates.
It has a nonparametric component and a regression component identified by a
finite-dimensional parameter. This chapter presents an efficient approach for
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of the nonparametric and the

Time-Optimal Online Replanning for Agile Quadrotor Flight,2022-03-18T10:27:50Z,"Angel Romero, Robert Penicka, Davide Scaramuzza","In this paper, we tackle the problem of flying a quadrotor using time-optimal
control policies that can be replanned online when the environment changes or
when encountering unknown disturbances. This problem is challenging as the
time-optimal trajectories that consider the full quadrotor dynamics are
computationally expensive to generate (order of minutes or even hours). We
introduce a sampling-based method for efficient generation of time-optimal
paths of a point-mass model. These paths are then tracked using a Model
Predictive Contouring Control approach that considers the full quadrotor
dynamics and the single rotor thrust limits. Our combined approach is able to
run in real-time, being the first time-optimal method that is able to adapt to
changes on-the-fly. We showcase our approach's adaption capabilities by flying
a quadrotor at more than 60 km/h in a racing track where gates are moving.
Additionally, we show that our online replanning approach can cope with strong
disturbances caused by winds of up to 68 km/h.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09839v2

  parameterizations, Lipschitz constants, and provable bounds",2022-03-16T23:47:56Z,"Trevor Avant, Kristi A. Morgansen","In this paper, we approach the task of determining sensitivity bounds for
pose estimation neural networks. This task is particularly challenging as it
requires characterizing the sensitivity of 3D rotations. We develop a
sensitivity measure that describes the maximum rotational change in a network's
output with respect to a Euclidean change in its input. We show that this
measure is a type of Lipschitz constant, and that it is bounded by the product
of a network's Euclidean Lipschitz constant and an intrinsic property of a
rotation parameterization which we call the ""distance ratio constant"". We
derive the distance ratio constant for several rotation parameterizations, and
then discuss why the structure of most of these parameterizations makes it
difficult to construct a pose estimation network with provable sensitivity
bounds. However, we show that sensitivity bounds can be computed for networks
which parameterize rotation using unconstrained exponential coordinates. We
then construct and train such a network and compute sensitivity bounds for it.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09937v1

Meshfree One-Fluid Modelling of Liquid-Vapor Phase Transitions,2022-03-19T19:16:04Z,"Pratik Suchde, Heinrich Kraus, Benjamin Bock-Marbach, Joerg Kuhnert","We introduce a meshfree collocation framework to model the phase change from
liquid to vapor at or above the boiling point. While typical vaporization or
boiling simulations focus on the vaporization from the bulk of the fluid, here
we include the possibility of vaporization from the free surface, when a moving
fluid comes into contact with a superheated surface. We present a continuum,
one-fluid approach in which the liquid and vapor phases are modeled with the
same constitutive equations, with different material properties. The novelty
here is a monolithic approach without explicit modeling of the interface
between the phases, neither in a sharp nor diffuse sense. Furthermore, no
interface boundary conditions or source terms are needed between the liquid and
vapor phases. Instead, the phase transition is modeled only using material
properties varying with temperature. Towards this end, we also present an
enrichment of strong form meshfree generalized finite difference methods (GFDM)
to accurately capture derivatives in the presence of jumps in density,
viscosity, and other physical properties. The numerical results show a good
agreement with experimental results, and highlight the ability of our proposed

grapheme-to-phoneme (g2p) conversion. Previous studies have approached this
problem using pre-trained language models, restricted output, and extra
information from Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. Inspired by these strategies, we
propose a novel approach, called g2pW, which adapts learnable softmax-weights
to condition the outputs of BERT with the polyphonic character of interest and
its POS tagging. Rather than using the hard mask as in previous works, our
experiments show that learning a soft-weighting function for the candidate
phonemes benefits performance. In addition, our proposed g2pW does not require
extra pre-trained POS tagging models while using POS tags as auxiliary features

video frames. Our algorithm consists of a CNN-based vehicle detection and
tracking step and an LSTM-based maneuver classification step. It is more
computationally efficient than other vision-based methods since it exploits a
small number of features for the classification step rather than feeding CNNs
with RGB frames. We evaluated our approach on a publicly available driving
dataset and a lane change detection dataset. We obtained 0.9585 accuracy with
side-aware two-class (cut-in vs. lane-pass) classification models. Experiment

"Match the Script, Adapt if Multilingual: Analyzing the Effect of
  Multilingual Pretraining on Cross-lingual Transferability",2022-03-21T06:52:38Z,"Yoshinari Fujinuma, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Katharina Kann","Pretrained multilingual models enable zero-shot learning even for unseen
languages, and that performance can be further improved via adaptation prior to
finetuning. However, it is unclear how the number of pretraining languages
influences a model's zero-shot learning for languages unseen during
pretraining. To fill this gap, we ask the following research questions: (1) How
does the number of pretraining languages influence zero-shot performance on
unseen target languages? (2) Does the answer to that question change with model
adaptation? (3) Do the findings for our first question change if the languages
used for pretraining are all related? Our experiments on pretraining with
related languages indicate that choosing a diverse set of languages is crucial.
Without model adaptation, surprisingly, increasing the number of pretraining
languages yields better results up to adding related languages, after which
performance plateaus. In contrast, with model adaptation via continued
pretraining, pretraining on a larger number of languages often gives further
improvement, suggesting that model adaptation is crucial to exploit additional
pretraining languages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10753v1

a toy model for the repeating changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We improve the work of PLC21 by including a non-zero viscous torque condition
on the inner boundary of disk and adopting a general form for the viscous
stress torque in Kerr metric. It is found that the 0.4-2 keV light curves, the
light curves at different energy bands and the phase-resolved X-ray spectrum of

available? We investigate this question using a unique geo-referenced high
frequency database on school openings, vaccinations, and Covid-19 cases from
the Italian region of Sicily. The analysis focuses on the change of Covid-19
diffusion after school opening in a homogeneous geographical territory. The
identification of causal effects derives from a comparison of the change in
cases before and after school opening in 2020/21, when vaccination was not
available, and in 2021/22, when the vaccination campaign targeted individuals
of age 12-19 and above 19. The results indicate that, while school opening
determined an increase in the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in 2020/2021, this
effect has been substantially reduced by school-age vaccination in 2021/2022.
In particular, we find that an increase of approximately 10% in the vaccination
rate of school-age population reduces the growth rate of Covid-19 cases after
school opening by approximately 1.4%. In addition, a counterfactual simulation
suggests that a permanent no vaccination scenario would have implied an

detected in J0640+07, J1005+30, J1132+25, and J1336+33, respectively. The
investigated RRATs have a different distribution of the pulses amplitude. For
J0640+07 and J1132+25, the distribution is described by a single exponent over
the entire range of flux densities. For J1005+30 and J1336+33, it is a

detected pulses with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of few hundreds. For
J1132+25 and J1336+33, the S/N of the strongest pulses reaches several tens.
These RRATs show strong changing of character of emission. When strengths of
pulse amplitudes significantly changed, we see long intervals of absence of

that it is possible that all the studied RRATs are, apparently, pulsars with

Bounds for Bias-Adjusted Treatment Effect in Linear Econometric Models,2022-03-23T14:11:44Z,Deepankar Basu,"In linear econometric models with proportional selection on unobservables,
omitted variable bias in estimated treatment effects are real roots of a cubic
equation involving estimated parameters from a short and intermediate
regression. The roots of the cubic are functions of $\delta$, the degree of
selection on unobservables, and $R_{max}$, the R-squared in a hypothetical long
regression that includes the unobservable confounder and all observable
controls. In this paper I propose and implement a novel algorithm to compute
roots of the cubic equation over relevant regions of the $\delta$-$R_{max}$
plane and use the roots to construct bounding sets for the true treatment
effect. The algorithm is based on two well-known mathematical results: (a) the
discriminant of the cubic equation can be used to demarcate regions of unique
real roots from regions of three real roots, and (b) a small change in the

Orientation Control of the Bouncing Ball,2022-03-23T19:22:08Z,"William Clark, Dora Kassabova","Control of a hybrid dynamical system can manifest in one of two main ways:

contrast, an example of discrete control would be in tennis; the player can
only influence the trajectory of the ball through striking it.
  This work examines the latter case with two key emphases. The first is that
controls manifest through changing the location of the guard (as opposed to
changing only the reset). The second is that the location of the guard is
described by ""external variables"" while the goal is to control ""internal
variables."" As a simple test of this theory, orientation control of a bouncing

divisive normalization in the U-Net architecture leads to better segmentation
results with respect to conventional U-Net. The gain increases steadily when
dealing with images acquired in bad weather conditions. In addition to the

zero energy modes from recent experiments in some iron-based superconductors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14017v3
Constructive controllability for incompressible vector fields,2022-03-26T17:40:40Z,"Sergey Kryzhevich, Eugene Stepanov","We give a constructive proof of a global controllability result for an
autonomous system of ODEs guided by bounded locally Lipschitz and divergence
free (i.e.\ incompressible) vector field, when the phase space is the whole
Euclidean space and the vector field satisfies so-called vanishing mean drift
condition. For the case when the ODE is defined over some smooth compact
connected Riemannian manifold, we significantly strengthen the assertion of the
known controllability theorem in absence of nonholonomic constraints by proving
that one can find a control steering the state vector from one given point to
another by using the observations of only the state vector, i.e., in other
words, by changing slightly the vector field, and such a change can be made
small not only in uniform, but also in Lipschitz (i.e. $C^1$) topology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14120v1
"Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Modal Split Prediction in
  Transportation Systems",2022-03-27T02:59:00Z,"Aron Brenner, Manxi Wu, Saurabh Amin","Modal split prediction in transportation networks has the potential to
support network operators in managing traffic congestion and improving transit
service reliability. We focus on the problem of hourly prediction of the
fraction of travelers choosing one mode of transportation over another using
high-dimensional travel time data. We use logistic regression as base model and
employ various regularization techniques for variable selection to prevent
overfitting and resolve multicollinearity issues. Importantly, we interpret the
prediction accuracy results with respect to the inherent variability of modal
splits and travelers' aggregate responsiveness to changes in travel time. By
visualizing model parameters, we conclude that the subset of segments found
important for predictive accuracy changes from hour-to-hour and include
segments that are topologically central and/or highly congested. We apply our
approach to the San Francisco Bay Area freeway and rapid transit network and
demonstrate superior prediction accuracy and interpretability of our method
compared to pre-specified variable selection methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14191v2
Free energy and inference in living systems,2022-03-27T03:16:06Z,Chang Sub Kim,"Organisms are nonequilibrium, stationary systems self-organized via
spontaneous symmetry breaking and undergoing metabolic cycles with broken
detailed balance in the environment. The thermodynamic free-energy principle
describes an organism's homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work
constrained by the physical free-energy cost. In contrast, recent research in
neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism's homeostasis
and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational free
energy. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents a
free-energy minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the
thermodynamic and neuroscientific free-energy principles. Our results reveal
that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed
by free-energy minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as
Schr{\""o}dinger's machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory
uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the
optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation
between neural attractors in the process of active inference.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14194v2
Audio-Adaptive Activity Recognition Across Video Domains,2022-03-27T08:15:20Z,"Yunhua Zhang, Hazel Doughty, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek","This paper strives for activity recognition under domain shift, for example
caused by change of scenery or camera viewpoint. The leading approaches reduce
the shift in activity appearance by adversarial training and self-supervised
learning. Different from these vision-focused works we leverage activity sounds
for domain adaptation as they have less variance across domains and can
reliably indicate which activities are not happening. We propose an
audio-adaptive encoder and associated learning methods that discriminatively
adjust the visual feature representation as well as addressing shifts in the
semantic distribution. To further eliminate domain-specific features and
include domain-invariant activity sounds for recognition, an audio-infused
recognizer is proposed, which effectively models the cross-modal interaction
across domains. We also introduce the new task of actor shift, with a
corresponding audio-visual dataset, to challenge our method with situations
where the activity appearance changes dramatically. Experiments on this

AWAPart: Adaptive Workload-Aware Partitioning of Knowledge Graphs,2022-03-28T16:41:27Z,"Amitabh Priyadarshi, Krzysztof J. Kochut","Large-scale knowledge graphs are increasingly common in many domains. Their
large sizes often exceed the limits of systems storing the graphs in a
centralized data store, especially if placed in main memory. To overcome this,
large knowledge graphs need to be partitioned into multiple sub-graphs and
placed in nodes in a distributed system. But querying these fragmented
sub-graphs poses new challenges, such as increased communication costs, due to
distributed joins involving cut edges. To combat these problems, a good
partitioning should reduce the edge cuts while considering a given query
workload. However, a partitioned graph needs to be continually re-partitioned
to accommodate changes in the query workload and maintain a good average
processing time. In this paper, an adaptive partitioning method for large-scale
knowledge graphs is introduced, which adapts the partitioning in response to

dynamically learn a sequence of optimal control policies non-parametrically,
while autonomously adapting with the constantly changing environment dynamics.
Specifically, our non-parametric kernel-based methodology embeds a policy
distribution as the features in a non-decreasing Euclidean space, therefore
allowing its search space to be defined as a very high (possible infinite)
dimensional RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). Moreover, by leveraging
the similarity metric computed in RKHS, we augmented our non-parametric
learning with the technique of AdaptiveH- adaptively selecting a time-frame
window of finishing the optimal part of whole action-sequence sampled on some
preceding observed state. To validate our proposed approach, we conducted
extensive experiments with multiple classic benchmarks and one simulated

Demystifying Software Release Note Issues on GitHub,2022-03-29T14:02:58Z,"Jianyu Wu, Hao He, Wenxin Xiao, Kai Gao, Minghui Zhou","Release notes (RNs) summarize main changes between two consecutive software
versions and serve as a central source of information when users upgrade

manually analyzing 1,731 latest GitHub issues to build a comprehensive taxonomy

Production. Among these issues, nearly half (48.47%) of them focus on
Production; Content, Accessibility, and Presentation take 25.61%, 17.65%, and

3) many users find RNs inaccessible due to link deterioration, lack of

  Point Generator",2022-03-29T16:02:16Z,"Chang Liu, Xiaoyan Qian, Xiaojuan Qi, Edmund Y. Lam, Siew-Chong Tan, Ngai Wong","Manually annotating 3D point clouds is laborious and costly, limiting the
training data preparation for deep learning in real-world object detection.
While a few previous studies tried to automatically generate 3D bounding boxes
from weak labels such as 2D boxes, the quality is sub-optimal compared to human
annotators. This work proposes a novel autolabeler, called multimodal attention
point generator (MAP-Gen), that generates high-quality 3D labels from weak 2D
boxes. It leverages dense image information to tackle the sparsity issue of 3D
point clouds, thus improving label quality. For each 2D pixel, MAP-Gen predicts
its corresponding 3D coordinates by referencing context points based on their
2D semantic or geometric relationships. The generated 3D points densify the
original sparse point clouds, followed by an encoder to regress 3D bounding
boxes. Using MAP-Gen, object detection networks that are weakly supervised by
2D boxes can achieve 94~99% performance of those fully supervised by 3D

we demonstrate integrated thermo-acoustic modulators using two SAW platforms:
bulk lithium niobate and thin-film lithium niobate on sapphire. In both

adversarial attacks to generate an explanation spectrum of data instances via
an iterative fast gradient sign method. Such unified explanation can avoid

An Algebraic Framework for Structured Epidemic Modeling,2022-02-28T17:44:55Z,"Sophie Libkind, Andrew Baas, Micah Halter, Evan Patterson, James Fairbanks","Pandemic management requires that scientists rapidly formulate and analyze
epidemiological models in order to forecast the spread of disease and the

create novel ones in light of new biological data and policy changes such as
social distancing and vaccination. Traditional scientific modeling workflows
detach the structure of a model -- its submodels and their interactions -- from
its implementation in software. Consequently, incorporating local changes to
model components may require global edits to the code-base through a manual,
time-intensive, and error-prone process. We propose a compositional modeling
framework that uses high-level algebraic structures to capture domain-specific
scientific knowledge and bridge the gap between how scientists think about
models and the code that implements them. These algebraic structures, grounded
in applied category theory, simplify and expedite modeling tasks such as model
specification, stratification, analysis, and calibration. With their structure
made explicit, models also become easier to communicate, criticize, and refine

axial mass and the effective mass that are compatible with the data. We find
that the total cross section is insensitive to the effective mass, so the axial
mass could be determined independently of the uncertainty in the effective
mass. Differential cross sections at different kinematics are, on the other
hand, sensitive to the effective mass as well as the axial mass. Within the
uncertainty of the axial mass constrained from the total cross section,
dependence on the effective mass is examined. As a result we obtain the axial

Self-adapting infectious dynamics on random networks,2022-03-31T11:13:17Z,"Konstantin Clauß, Christian Kuehn","Self-adaptive dynamics occurs in many physical systems such as

We apply this framework to basic epidemic models (SIS, SIR) on random networks.
We consider a co-evolutionary dynamical network where node-states change
through the epidemics and network topology changes through creation and
deletion of edges. For a simple threshold base application of lockdown measures
we observe large regions in parameter space with oscillatory behavior. For the
SIS epidemic model, we derive analytic expressions for the oscillation period

lengthening of the coherence time. This will erase temporal distinguishability
of photons due to time delay in pulsed photon interference. However, this is
changed in an SU(1,1)-type quantum interferometer where quantum entanglement is
involved. In this paper, we investigate how the temporal coherence of the
fields in a pulse-pumped SU(1,1) interferometer changes with the bandwidth of

important predictions: the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is
generally decreasing but can be increasing for intermediate wealth levels, and
it jumps inversely proportional to the risk aversion at the reference point;
the implied relative risk aversion is roughly a smile in wealth; the welfare of
the poor is more vulnerable to wealth shocks than the wealthy. Moreover,

protect transoceanic fiber optic systems against big geomagnetic storm events.

two miscible components, forming a pseudo-scalar bubble condensate with
enhanced quantum fluctuations (quantum bubble), immersed in a bath provided by
a third component, with which they are immiscible. We show that in such a
peculiar effective binary mixture, quantum fluctuations change the equilibrium
of pressures that define the bubble volume and modify as well the criterion for

SAM-kNN Regressor for Online Learning in Water Distribution Networks,2022-04-04T12:40:05Z,"Jonathan Jakob, André Artelt, Martina Hasenjäger, Barbara Hammer","Water distribution networks are a key component of modern infrastructure for
housing and industry. They transport and distribute water via widely branched
networks from sources to consumers. In order to guarantee a working network at
all times, the water supply company continuously monitors the network and takes
actions when necessary -- e.g. reacting to leakages, sensor faults and drops in
water quality. Since real world networks are too large and complex to be
monitored by a human, algorithmic monitoring systems have been developed. A
popular type of such systems are residual based anomaly detection systems that
can detect events such as leakages and sensor faults. For a continuous high
quality monitoring, it is necessary for these systems to adapt to changed
demands and presence of various anomalies.
  In this work, we propose an adaption of the incremental SAM-kNN classifier

Random Double Tensors Integrals,2022-04-05T01:32:02Z,Shih Yu Chang,"In this work, we try to build a theory for random double tensor integrals
(DTI). We begin with the definition of DTI and discuss how randomness structure
is built upon DTI. Then, the tail bound of the unitarily invariant norm for the
random DTI is established and this bound can help us to derive tail bounds of
the unitarily invariant norm for various types of two tensors means, e.g.,
arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, and general mean. By
associating DTI with perturbation formula, i.e., a formula to relate the
tensor-valued function difference with respect the difference of the function
input tensors, the tail bounds of the unitarily invariant norm for the
Lipschitz estimate of tensor-valued function with random tensors as arguments
are derived for vanilla case and quasi-commutator case, respectively. We also
establish the continuity property for random DTI in the sense of convergence in
the random tensor mean, and we apply this continuity property to obtain the
tail bound of the unitarily invariant norm for the derivative of the
tensor-valued function.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01927v1
"Trajectories and Radiation of Charged Particles in the Pulsar
  Magnetosphere",2022-04-05T09:15:15Z,"Shan Chang, Li Zhang, Zejun Jiang, Xiang Li","Trajectories and radiation of the accelerating electrons are studied in the
pulsar magnetosphere approximated as the electromagnetic field of the Deutsch's
solutions. Because the electrons are accelerated rapidly to ultra-relativistic
velocity near the neutron star surface, the electron velocity vector (and then
its trajectory) is derived from the balance between Lorentz force and radiation
reaction force, which makes the pitch angle between electron trajectories and
magnetic field lines nonzero in most part of the magnetosphere. In such a case,
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of synchro-curvature radiation for the
accelerating electrons with a mono-energetic form are calculated. Our results
indicate that: (i) the pitch angle is the function of electron position ($r,
\theta, \phi$) in the open field line regions, and increases with increasing
$r$ and $\theta$ as well as increasing the inclination angle; (ii) the radius
of curvature becomes large along the particle trajectory, and (iii) the SED
appears a double peak structure depending on the emission position, where the
synchrotron radiation plays an important role in X-ray band and curvature
radiation mainly works in GeV band, which is only determined by parameters

properties of such materials under high pressure or high temperature - which is
of great significance in fundamental research. According to band schemas, those

the metal atoms first undergo hybridization of its s, p, d, and f orbitals, and
then bond with the carbon's pz orbitals of the nearest-neighbor octagons. The
electron orbital spin up of C and Th is symmetrical with spin down, so there is
no electron spin polarization. However, the s, p, d, and f orbitals of U and Pu

than breaking it. The odd-frequency pairing correlations always coexist with
the quasiparticle states below the gap. The YSR state is an example of such a

transitions from flowing along a smooth bed to flowing through the roughness

the head and tail structure typical of smooth bed gravity currents, to a wedge

This reduction can be ascribed to two mechanisms: the coupling between
compressive strain and the phase-transition order parameter; the changes in the
ferroelectric distortion. We give two alternative explanations of this
phenomenon: from an atomistic point of view, analyzing the evolution of the
bond lengths, and from a symmetry-analysis point of view, considering the
changes in the amplitude of the symmetry-allowed distortions, when a slab

Open-set Text Recognition via Character-Context Decoupling,2022-04-12T05:43:46Z,"Chang Liu, Chun Yang, Xu-Cheng Yin","The open-set text recognition task is an emerging challenge that requires an
extra capability to cognize novel characters during evaluation. We argue that a
major cause of the limited performance for current methods is the confounding
effect of contextual information over the visual information of individual

information can be passed down to visual information, consequently impairing
the classification performance. In this paper, a Character-Context Decoupling
framework is proposed to alleviate this problem by separating contextual
information and character-visual information. Contextual information can be
decomposed into temporal information and linguistic information. Here, temporal
information that models character order and word length is isolated with a
detached temporal attention module. Linguistic information that models n-gram

ViViD++: Vision for Visibility Dataset,2022-04-13T06:01:27Z,"Alex Junho Lee, Younggun Cho, Young-sik Shin, Ayoung Kim, Hyun Myung","In this paper, we present a dataset capturing diverse visual data formats
that target varying luminance conditions. While RGB cameras provide nourishing
and intuitive information, changes in lighting conditions potentially result in
catastrophic failure for robotic applications based on vision sensors.
Approaches overcoming illumination problems have included developing more
robust algorithms or other types of visual sensors, such as thermal and event
cameras. Despite the alternative sensors' potential, there still are few
datasets with alternative vision sensors. Thus, we provided a dataset recorded
from alternative vision sensors, by handheld or mounted on a car, repeatedly in
the same space but in different conditions. We aim to acquire visible
information from co-aligned alternative vision sensors. Our sensor system
collects data more independently from visible light intensity by measuring the
amount of infrared dissipation, depth by structured reflection, and
instantaneous temporal changes in luminance. We provide these measurements
along with inertial sensors and ground-truth for developing robust visual SLAM
under poor illumination. The full dataset is available at:

Complexity in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model,2022-04-13T13:11:58Z,"Kunal Pal, Kuntal Pal, Tapobrata Sarkar","We study complexity in a spin system with infinite range interaction, via the
paradigmatic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, in the thermodynamic limit. Exact
expressions for the Nielsen complexity (NC) and the Fubini-Study complexity
(FSC) are derived, that helps us to establish several distinguishing features
compared to complexity in other known spin models. In a time-independent LMG
model, close to phase transition, the NC diverges logarithmically, much like
the entanglement entropy. Remarkably however, in a time dependent scenario,
this divergence is replaced by a finite discontinuity, as we show by using the
Lewis-Riesenfeld theory of time-dependent invariant operators. The FSC of a
variant of the LMG model shows novel behaviour compared to quasi free spin
models. Namely, it diverges logarithmically when the target (or reference)
state is near the separatrix. Numerical analysis indicates that this is due to
the fact that geodesics starting with arbitrary boundary conditions are
""attracted"" towards the separatrix and that near this line, a finite change in
the affine parameter of the geodesic produces an infinitesimal change of the
geodesic length. The same divergence is shared by the NC of this model as well.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06354v1
Software Supply Chain Map: How Reuse Networks Expand,2022-04-13T17:22:41Z,"Hideaki Hata, Takashi Ishio","Clone-and-own is a typical code reuse approach because of its simplicity and
efficiency. Cloned software components are maintained independently by a new
owner. These clone-and-own operations can be occurred sequentially, that is,
cloned components can be cloned again and owned by other new owners on the
supply chain. In general, code reuse is not documented well, consequently,
appropriate changes like security patches cannot be propagated to descendant
software projects. However, the OpenChain Project defined identifying and
tracking source code reuses as responsibilities of FLOSS software staffs. Hence
supporting source code reuse awareness is in a real need. This paper studies
software reuse relations in FLOSS ecosystem. Technically, clone-and-own reuses
of source code can be identified by file-level clone set detection. Since
change histories are associated with files, we can determine origins and
destinations in reusing across multiple software by considering times. By
building software supply chain maps, we find that clone-and-own is prevalent in
FLOSS development, and set of files are reused widely and repeatedly. These
observations open up future challenges of maintaining and tracking global
software genealogies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06531v1

The required parameter changes are calculated from the variation of a single

accurately identify Byzantine nodes. The simulation results show that both

binary systems with interacting winds. The high temperatures, UV photon flux
and violent shocks should destroy any dust grains that condense. However, in
some extreme cases dust production yields of approximately 30% of the total
mass loss rate of the stellar winds have been observed. In order to better
understand this phenomenon a parameter space exploration was performed using a
series of numerical models of dust producing carbon phase Wolf-Rayet (WCd)
systems. These models incorporated a passive scalar dust model simulating dust
growth, destruction and radiative cooling. We find that reasonable dust yields
were produced by these simulations. Significant changes in the dust yield were
caused by changing the mass loss rates of the stars, with a greater mass loss
rate contributing to increased dust yields. Similarly, a close orbit between
the stars also resulted in higher dust yields. Finally, a high velocity wind
shear, which induces Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities and wind mixing,
drastically increases the dust yields.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07397v3

actions) or shortcut paths (multiple sequences of actions with lower cost than
a direct path). We ask (1) when is non-brute-force navigation possible?; (2) do
shortcuts exist and what are their properties?; and (3) what heuristics predict
shortcut existence? Using several empirical datasets, we show that (1)
non-brute-force navigation is only possible between some state pairs, (2)

  The major findings are: (1) diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) reduces

players winning rates declined consistently from 20 years and as they get

effects of AI on the ageing declination and the probability of winning are

"Squeezed States Generation using Cryogenic InP HEMT Transistor
  Nonlinearity",2022-04-18T12:46:46Z,Ahmad Salmanogli,"This study focuses on generating and manipulating squeezed states with two
external oscillators coupled by an InP HEMT transistor operating at cryogenic
temperatures. First, the small-signal nonlinear model of the transistor at high
frequency at 5 K is analyzed using quantum theory, and the related Lagrangian
is theoretically derived. Subsequently, the total quantum Hamiltonian of the
system is derived using Legendre transformation. The Hamiltonian of the system
includes linear and nonlinear terms, by which the effects on the time evolution
of the states are studied. The main result shows that the squeezed state can be
generated owing to the nonlinearity of the transistor, and more importantly, it
can be manipulated by some specific terms introduced in the nonlinear
Hamiltonian. In fact, the nonlinearity of the transistors induces some effects
such as capacitance, inductance, and second-order transconductance, by which
the properties of the external oscillators are changed. These changes may lead
to squeezing or manipulation of the parameters related to squeezing in the
oscillators. In addition, it is theoretically derived that the circuit can
generate two-mode squeezing. Finally, second-order correlation (photon counting

that the designed circuit exhibits antibunching, where the quadrature operator

existing learning-to-route MoE methods suffer from the routing fluctuation
issue, i.e., the target expert of the same input may change along with
training, but only one expert will be activated for the input during inference.
The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input
updates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we
propose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation
problem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing
strategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone
model. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to
determine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing
strategy. We validate our method on language modeling and multilingual machine

Inclusion unlocks the creative potential of gender diversity in teams,2022-04-06T15:10:44Z,"Balazs Vedres, Orsolya Vasarhelyi","Diversity in teams can boost creativity, and gender diversity was shown to be
a contributor to collective creativity. We show that gender diversity requires
inclusion to lead to benefits in creativity by analyzing teams in 4011 video

we developed four measures of inclusion, depending on a lack of segregation,
strong ties across genders, and the incorporation of women into the core of the
team s network. We found that gender diversity without inclusion does not
contribute to creativity, while with maximal inclusion one standard deviation
change in diversity results in .04 to .09 standard deviation change in
creativity, depending on the measure of inclusion. To reap creative benefits of
diversity, developer firms need to include 23 percent or more female developers
(as opposed to the 15 percent mean female proportion) and include them in the
team along all dimensions. Inclusion at low diversity has a negative effect. By
analyzing the sequences of diversity and inclusion across games within firms,

constant-height measurement experimentally impractical, lending
constant-current spectroscopy an advantageous edge; but the differential
conductance in that case is even further removed from the local density of
states due to the changing tip height. Here, we present a normalization scheme
for extracting the local density of states from high bias scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, obtained in either constant-current or constant-height mode. We
extend this model to account for the effects of the in-plane momentum of the

demonstrate that these two electronic phenomena are readily reproduced and
understood in density functional theory, but that neither perturbs the trend in
c/a ratio against pressure. Hence the observed anomalies in c/a must have
another cause. Osmium is also notable for its high yield stress: the c/a
anomalies lie well within the differential strains which osmium can support. We
propose that observed c/a changes can arise from mechanical yield of
crystallites with strong preferred orientation under high deviatoric stress in

convolutional filter activation of the new input to the statistical model and
flags activations that are outside the expected range of values and therefore
likely an anomaly. By using a pretrained network, FADS demonstrates excellent
performance similar to or better than other machine learning approaches to
anomaly detection while at the same time FADS requires no tuning of the CNN
weights. We demonstrate FADS ability by detecting process parameter changes on
a custom dataset of additively manufactured lattices. The FADS localization

SoftEdge: Regularizing Graph Classification with Random Soft Edges,2022-04-21T20:12:36Z,"Hongyu Guo, Sun Sun","Augmented graphs play a vital role in regularizing Graph Neural Networks

augmentation. Nevertheless, such common augmentation techniques can
dramatically change the semantics of the original graph, causing overaggressive
augmentation and thus under-fitting in the GNN learning. To address this
problem arising from dropping or adding graph edges and nodes, we propose
SoftEdge, which assigns random weights to a portion of the edges of a given
graph for augmentation. The synthetic graph generated by SoftEdge maintains the
same nodes and their connectivities as the original graph, thus mitigating the
semantic changes of the original graph. We empirically show that this simple

Alleviating Representational Shift for Continual Fine-tuning,2022-04-22T06:58:20Z,"Shibo Jie, Zhi-Hong Deng, Ziheng Li","We study a practical setting of continual learning: fine-tuning on a
pre-trained model continually. Previous work has found that, when training on
new tasks, the features (penultimate layer representations) of previous data
will change, called representational shift. Besides the shift of features, we
reveal that the intermediate layers' representational shift (IRS) also matters
since it disrupts batch normalization, which is another crucial cause of
catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we propose ConFiT, a fine-tuning
method incorporating two components, cross-convolution batch normalization
(Xconv BN) and hierarchical fine-tuning. Xconv BN maintains pre-convolution
running means instead of post-convolution, and recovers post-convolution ones
before testing, which corrects the inaccurate estimates of means under IRS.
Hierarchical fine-tuning leverages a multi-stage strategy to fine-tune the
pre-trained network, preventing massive changes in Conv layers and thus
alleviating IRS. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method
remarkably outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with lower storage

Quantum Schur Transform is a unitary change of basis transformation between the
computational basis of $(\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$ and the Schur-Weyl basis of

Louck's formula for calculating the transition amplitudes between two standard
Weyl tableaux appearing in adjacent levels of the Schur-Weyl-Young graph for
the case $d=2$, merely by looking at the entries in the two tableaux. The key
theoretical component that underpins our results is the discovery of a
branching rule for the Schur-Weyl states, which we call the Schur-Weyl

  Characters with only a Few Utterances",2022-04-22T17:11:17Z,"Seungju Han, Beomsu Kim, Jin Yong Yoo, Seokjun Seo, Sangbum Kim, Enkhbayar Erdenee, Buru Chang","In this paper, we consider mimicking fictional characters as a promising
direction for building engaging conversation models. To this end, we present a
new practical task where only a few utterances of each fictional character are
available to generate responses mimicking them. Furthermore, we propose a new
method named Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) that generates responses by
leveraging the power of large-scale language models with prompts containing the
target character's utterances. To better reflect the style of the character,
PDP builds the prompts in the form of dialog that includes the character's
utterances as dialog history. Since only utterances of the characters are
available in the proposed task, PDP matches each utterance with an appropriate
pseudo-context from a predefined set of context candidates using a retrieval
model. Through human and automatic evaluation, we show that PDP generates
responses that better reflect the style of fictional characters than baseline

BatchHL: Answering Distance Queries on Batch-Dynamic Networks at Scale,2022-04-23T07:39:11Z,"Muhammad Farhan, Qing Wang, Henning Koehler","Many real-world applications operate on dynamic graphs that undergo rapid
changes in their topological structure over time. However, it is challenging to
design dynamic algorithms that are capable of supporting such graph changes
efficiently. To circumvent the challenge, we propose a batch-dynamic framework
for answering distance queries, which combines offline labelling and online
searching to leverage the advantages from both sides - accelerating query
processing through a partial distance labelling that is of limited size but
provides a good approximation to bound online searches. We devise batch-dynamic
algorithms to dynamize a distance labelling efficiently in order to reflect
batch updates on the underlying graph. In addition to providing theoretical
analysis for the correctness, labelling minimality, and computational
complexity, we have conducted experiments on 14 real-world networks to
empirically verify the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11012v1
On the semantics of big Earth observation data for land classification,2022-04-23T14:45:53Z,Gilberto Camara,"This paper discusses the challenges of using big Earth observation data for
land classification. The approach taken is to consider pure data-driven methods
to be insufficient to represent continuous change. We argue for sound theories
when working with big data. After revising existing classification schemes such
as FAO's Land Cover Classification System (LCCS), we conclude that LCCS and
similar proposals cannot capture the complexity of landscape dynamics. We then
investigate concepts that are being used for analyzing satellite image time
series; we show these concepts to be instances of events. Therefore, for
continuous monitoring of land change, event recognition needs to replace object
identification as the prevailing paradigm. The paper concludes by showing how
event semantics can improve data-driven methods to fulfil the potential of big
data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11082v1
Occupation time of a renewal process coupled to a discrete Markov chain,2022-04-24T09:45:45Z,"Théo Dessertaine, Claude Godrèche, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud","A semi-Markov process is one that changes states in accordance with a Markov
chain but takes a random amount of time between changes. We consider the
generalisation to semi-Markov processes of the classical Lamperti law for the
occupation time of a two-state Markov process. We provide an explicit
expression in Laplace space for the distribution of an arbitrary linear
combination of the occupation times in the various states of the process. We
discuss several consequences of this result. In particular, we infer the

"$φ$ meson properties in nuclear matter from QCD sum rules with
  chirally separated four-quark condensates",2022-04-25T05:20:01Z,"Jisu Kim, Philipp Gubler, Su Houng Lee","The modification of the $\phi$ meson spectrum in nuclear matter is studied in
an updated QCD sum rule analysis, taking into account recent improvements in
properly treating the chiral invariant and breaking components of four-quark
condensates. Allowing both mass and decay width to change at finite density,
the QCD sum rule analysis determines certain combinations of changes for these
parameters that satisfy the sum rules equally well. A comprehensive error
analysis, including uncertainties related to the behavior of various
condensates at linear order in density, the employed renormalization scale and
perturbative corrections of the Wilson coefficients, is used to compute the
allowed ranges of these parameter combinations. We find that the $\phi$ meson
mass shift in nuclear matter is especially sensitive to the strange sigma term
$\sigma_{sN}$, which determines the decrease of the strange quark condensate in
nuclear matter. Specifically, we obtain a linear relation between the width
$\Gamma_{\phi}$ and mass shift $\Delta m_{\phi}$ given as $ \Gamma_{\phi} =
a\Delta m_{\phi} + b\sigma_{sN}+c$ with $a = (3.947^{+0.139}_{-0.130})$, $b =

Visibility graphs of animal foraging trajectories,2022-04-25T14:28:10Z,"Leticia R. Paiva, Sidiney G. Alves, Lucas Lacasa, Og DeSouza, Octavio Miramontes","The study of self-propelled particles is a fast-growing research topic where
biologically inspired movement is increasingly becoming of much interest. A
relevant example is the collective motion of social insects, whose variety and
complexity offer fertile grounds for theoretical abstractions. It has been
demonstrated that the collective motion involved in the searching behavior of
termites is consistent with self-similarity, anomalous diffusion and L\'evy
walks. In this work, we use visibility graphs -- a method that maps time series
into graphs and quantifies the signal complexity via graph topological metrics
-- in the context of social insects foraging trajectories extracted from
experiments. Our analysis indicates that the patterns observed for isolated
termites change qualitatively when the termite density is increased, and such
change cannot be explained by jamming effects only, pointing to collective
effects emerging due to non-trivial foraging interactions between insects as
the cause. Moreover, we find that such an onset of complexity is maximized for
intermediate termite densities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11690v1
Casimir contribution to the interfacial Hamiltonian for 3D wetting,2022-04-26T14:49:13Z,"Alessio Squarcini, José M. Romero-Enrique, Andrew O. Parry","Previous treatments of three-dimensional (3D) short-ranged wetting
transitions have missed an entropic or low temperature Casimir contribution to
the binding potential describing the interaction between the unbinding
interface and wall. This we determine by exactly deriving the interfacial model
for 3D wetting from a more microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The
Casimir term changes the interpretation of fluctuation effects occurring at
wetting transitions so that, for example, mean-field predictions are no longer
obtained when interfacial fluctuations are ignored. While the Casimir
contribution does not alter the surface phase diagram, it significantly
increases the adsorption near a first-order wetting transition and changes
completely the predicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting,
including the non-universality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial
fluctuations. Using the numerical renormalization group we show that, for
critical wetting, the asymptotic regime is extremely narrow with the growth of
the parallel correlation length characterised by an effective exponent in
quantitative agreement with Ising model simulations, resolving a longstanding
controversy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12353v1

data from three additional apparitions including 2018/19. The original
conclusion regarding Giacobini-Zinner's chemical composition remains unchanged,
with it having a 4-6x depletion in the carbon-chain molecules C2 and C3, and in
NH, as compared with both OH and CN. The comet continues to exhibit a large
asymmetry in production rates as a function of time and heliocentric distance,
with production reaching a peak 3-5 weeks prior to perihelion. All species,
including dust, follow the same general production rate curve each apparition,
and the carbon-bearing species are always very similar to one another. However,
OH and NH each differ in detail from the carbon-bearing species, implying
somewhat varied composition between source regions. Longer term, there are only
small secular changes among the apparitions before and near perihelion, but
larger changes are evident as the comet recedes from the Sun, suggestive of a

Learning Value Functions from Undirected State-only Experience,2022-04-26T17:24:36Z,"Matthew Chang, Arjun Gupta, Saurabh Gupta","This paper tackles the problem of learning value functions from undirected
state-only experience (state transitions without action labels i.e. (s,s',r)
tuples). We first theoretically characterize the applicability of Q-learning in
this setting. We show that tabular Q-learning in discrete Markov decision
processes (MDPs) learns the same value function under any arbitrary refinement
of the action space. This theoretical result motivates the design of Latent
Action Q-learning or LAQ, an offline RL method that can learn effective value
functions from state-only experience. Latent Action Q-learning (LAQ) learns
value functions using Q-learning on discrete latent actions obtained through a
latent-variable future prediction model. We show that LAQ can recover value
functions that have high correlation with value functions learned using ground
truth actions. Value functions learned using LAQ lead to sample efficient
acquisition of goal-directed behavior, can be used with domain-specific
low-level controllers, and facilitate transfer across embodiments. Our
experiments in 5 environments ranging from 2D grid world to 3D visual
navigation in realistic environments demonstrate the benefits of LAQ over
simpler alternatives, imitation learning oracles, and competing methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12458v1
"Gravitational waves from small spin-up and spin-down events of neutron
  stars",2022-04-27T12:04:41Z,"Garvin Yim, D. I. Jones","It was recently reported that there exists a population of ""glitch
candidates"" and ""anti-glitch candidates"" which are effectively small spin-ups
and spin-downs of a neutron star with magnitudes smaller than those seen in
typical glitches. The physical origin of these small events is not yet
understood. In this paper, we outline a model that can account for the changes
in spin, and crucially, is independently testable with gravitational wave
observations. In brief, the model posits that small spin-up/spin-down events
are caused by the excitation and decay of non-axisymmetric $f$-modes which
radiate angular momentum away in a burst-like way as gravitational waves. The
model takes the change in spin frequency as an input and outputs the initial
mode amplitude and the signal-to-noise ratio achievable from gravitational wave
detectors. We find that the model presented here will become falsifiable once
3rd generation gravitational wave detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and
Cosmic Explorer, begin taking data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12869v3

cross-section of the ground state of the Kr atom and photon energy, three
particular photon energies close to the near inner orbital energy of 1.75 keV,
1.90 keV, and 14.30 keV are determined in this work. The dynamical simulation
under 17.50 keV photon energy in the experimental conditions is achieved by
implementing the Monte Carlo method and optimizing the photon flux modeling
parameters. As a result, our calculated data are more consistent with the
experimental phenomena. The light saturation phenomenon of Kr at 1.75 keV, 1.90

using the optimized photon flux model theory. We statistically compare the main
ionization paths under those four specific photon energies and calculate the
population changes of various hollow atoms. The results demonstrate that the
ratio of hollow atoms produced at the critical ionization photon energy is
high. Furthermore, the change of position is smooth, showing the significant

demonstrate that the radial component of the tidal force changes sign outside
the single event horizon for any negative values of the cosmological constant,
in contrast to the Schwarzschild black hole, where all the components of the
tidal force are sign-constant. We also find the similarity between the Kottler
black hole and the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, because we indicate the value
of the cosmological constant, which ensures the existence of two horizons of
the black hole, between which the angular components of the tidal force change

financial markets generated fake orders in continuous spaces because of GAN
architectures' learning limitations. However, in reality, the orders are
discrete, such as order prices, which has minimum order price unit, or order
types. Thus, we change the generation method to place the generated fake orders
into discrete spaces in this study. Because this change disabled the ordinary
GAN learning algorithm, this study employed a policy gradient, frequently used
in reinforcement learning, for the learning algorithm. Through our experiments,
we show that our proposed model outperforms previous models in generated order
distribution. As an additional benefit of introducing the policy gradient, the
entropy of the generated policy can be used to check GAN's learning status. In
the future, higher performance GANs, better evaluation methods, or the
applications of our GANs can be addressed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13338v1

Perceptual Visibility Model for Temporal Contrast Changes in Periphery,2022-04-29T23:41:45Z,"Cara Tursun, Piotr Didyk","Modeling perception is critical for many applications and developments in
computer graphics to optimize and evaluate content generation techniques. Most

human perception is drastically different. In this paper, we focus on modeling

equilibrium distribution function, it is possible to use the D2Q5 lattice for
the two dimensional cases consided here, making it is more efficiency than
previous works in which the lattice is usually limited to the D2Q9. This
approach is firstly validated by the problems of droplet evaporation in open

doping. The exchange parameters could be controlled by the doping carriers. The
carriers doping could modulate MAE to -18.4 (+0.4 e), -0.85 (-1.6 e), 1.31

RangeSeg: Range-Aware Real Time Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Point Clouds,2022-05-02T09:57:59Z,"Tzu-Hsuan Chen, Tian Sheuan Chang","Semantic outdoor scene understanding based on 3D LiDAR point clouds is a
challenging task for autonomous driving due to the sparse and irregular data

different LiDAR laser beams to propose a range aware instance segmentation

dependent decoders. A heavy decoder only computes top of a range image where
the far and small objects locate to improve small object detection accuracy,
and a light decoder computes whole range image for low computational cost. The
results are further clustered by the DBSCAN method with a resolution weighted
distance function to get instance-level segmentation results. Experiments on
the KITTI dataset show that RangeSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic

edits by augmenting off-the-shelf images in a target domain. The benefits are
remarkable: implemented as a state-of-the-art auto-regressive transformer, our
approach is simple, sidesteps difficulties with previous methods based on
GAN-like priors, obtains significantly better edits, and is efficient.
Furthermore, we show that different blending effects can be learned by an

An integrated debris environment assessment model,2022-05-10T22:56:49Z,"Akhil Rao, Francesca Letizia","Launch behaviors are a key determinant of the orbital environment. Physical
and economic forces such as fragmentations and changing launch costs, or
policies like post-mission disposal (PMD) compliance requirements, will alter
the relative attractiveness of different orbits and lead operators to adjust
their launch behaviors. However, integrating models of adaptive launch behavior
with models of the debris environment remains an open challenge. We present a
statistical framework for integrating theoretically-grounded models of launch
behavior with evolutionary models of the low-Earth orbit (LEO) environment. We
implement this framework using data on satellite launches, the orbital
environment, launch vehicle prices, sectoral revenues, and government budgets
over 2007-2020. The data are combined with a multi-shell and multi-species
Particle-in-a-Box (PIB) model of the debris environment and a two-stage
budgeting model of commercial, civil government, and defense decisions to
allocate new launches across orbital shells. We demonstrate the framework's
capabilities in three counterfactual scenarios: unexpected fragmentation events
in highly-used regions, a sharp decrease in the cost of accessing lower parts
of LEO, and increasing compliance with 25-year PMD guidelines. Substitution
across orbits based on their evolving characteristics and the behavior of other

agent has exactly one representative. We study the winner determination problem

magnetic properties. We find, based on first principles calculations, that the
relatively minor structural distortion from the cubic antiperovskite structure

separation into Fe sites with very different magnetic behaviors, specifically a
site with Fe atoms having a stable local moment and a site where the Fe shows
characteristics of much more itinerant behavior. This shows a remarkable
flexibility of the Fe magnetic behavior in these nitrides and points towards
the possibility of systems where minor structural and chemical changes can lead
to dramatic changes in magnetic properties. The results suggest that,
analogously to oxide perovskite materials, modulation of magnetic properties
via chemical or strain control of octahedral rotation may be feasible. This may
then lead to approaches for tuning magnetism to realize properties of interest,

Quantum Computing and Preconditioners for Hydrological Linear Systems,2022-05-12T22:04:33Z,"John Golden, Daniel O'Malley, Hari Viswanathan","Modeling hydrological fracture networks is a hallmark challenge in
computational earth sciences. Accurately predicting critical features of
fracture systems, e.g. percolation, can require solving large linear systems

approaches, however several technical issues must first be addressed. Chief
amongst these difficulties is that such systems are often ill-conditioned, i.e.
small changes in the system can produce large changes in the solution, which
can slow down the performance of linear solving algorithms. We test several
existing quantum techniques to improve the condition number, but find they are
insufficient. We then introduce the inverse Laplacian preconditioner, which
improves the scaling of the condition number of the system from $O(N)$ to

Bandwidth Cost of Code Conversions in the Split Regime,2022-05-13T17:31:51Z,"Francisco Maturana, K. V. Rashmi","Distributed storage systems must store large amounts of data over long
periods of time. To avoid data loss due to device failures, an $[n,k]$ erasure
code is used to encode $k$ data symbols into a codeword of $n$ symbols that are
stored across different devices. However, device failure rates change
throughout the life of the data, and tuning $n$ and $k$ according to these
changes has been shown to save significant storage space. Code conversion is
the process of converting multiple codewords of an initial $[n^I,k^I]$ code

consider the case where the initial and final codes are MDS and a single
initial codeword is split into several final codewords ($k^I=\lambda^F k^F$ for

  Blockaid is an access-policy enforcement system that preserves application

of Traces (ACT), localizes incidents by comparing sets of traces (which capture
events and their relationships for individual requests) sampled from the most
recent steady-state operation and during an incident. In our quantitative
experiments, we show that ACT is able to effectively localize more than 99% of

Near-field Probing of Optical Superchirality for Enhanced Bio-detection,2022-05-15T16:41:39Z,"Victor Tabouillot, Rahul Kumar, Paula L. Lalaguna, Maryam Hajji, Rebecca Clarke, Affar Karimullah, Andrew R.

biological and pharmaceutical molecules to be detected, through the highly
localised changes in the chiral asymmetries of the near-fields that they
induce. However, current chiral nanophotonic based strategies are intrinsically
limited because they rely on far-field optical measurements that are sensitive
to a much larger near-field volume, than that influenced by the chiral
molecules. Consequently, they depend on detecting small changes in far-field
optical response restricting detection sensitivities. Here we exploit an
intriguing phenomenon, plasmonic circularly polarised luminescence (PCPL),
which is an incisive local probe of near-field chirality. This allows chiral
detection of monolayer quantities of a de novo designed peptide, which is not
achieved with a far-field response. Our work demonstrates that by leveraging
the capabilities of nanophotonic platforms with the near-field sensitivity of

Manifold Characteristics That Predict Downstream Task Performance,2022-05-16T06:59:51Z,"Ruan van der Merwe, Gregory Newman, Etienne Barnard","Pretraining methods are typically compared by evaluating the accuracy of
linear classifiers, transfer learning performance, or visually inspecting the
representation manifold's (RM) lower-dimensional projections. We show that the
differences between methods can be understood more clearly by investigating the
RM directly, which allows for a more detailed comparison. To this end, we
propose a framework and new metric to measure and compare different RMs. We
also investigate and report on the RM characteristics for various pretraining
methods. These characteristics are measured by applying sequentially larger
local alterations to the input data, using white noise injections and Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks, and then tracking each datapoint.
We calculate the total distance moved for each datapoint and the relative
change in distance between successive alterations. We show that self-supervised
methods learn an RM where alterations lead to large but constant size changes,
indicating a smoother RM than fully supervised methods. We then combine these
measurements into one metric, the Representation Manifold Quality Metric
(RMQM), where larger values indicate larger and less variable step sizes, and
show that RMQM correlates positively with performance on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07477v1
"Twisting the near-field radiative heat switch in hyperbolic
  antiferromagnets",2022-05-16T13:09:58Z,"Yuanyang Du, Jiebin Peng, Zhong Shi, Jie Ren","We study the twisted control of the near-field radiative heat transfer
between two hyperbolic antiferromagnetic insulators under external magnetic
fields. We show that the near-field heat flux can be affected by both the twist
angle $\theta$ and the magnitude of the applied magnetic field with different
broken symmetries. Irrespective of twist angle, the external magnetic field
causes the radiative heat flux to change nonmonotonically, and the minimum heat
flux can be found with the magnetic fields of about 1.5 T. Such nonmonotonic
behavior is due to the fact that the magnetic field can radically change the
nature of the magnon polaritons with time reversal symmetry breaking. The field
not only affects the topological structure of surface magnon polaritons, but
also induces the volume magnon polaritons that progressively dominate the heat
transfer as the field increases. We further propose a twist-induced thermal
switch device with inversion symmetry breaking, which can severely regulate
radiative heat flux through different magnetic fields. Our findings account for
a characteristic modulation of radiative heat transfer with implications for
applications in dynamic thermal management.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07648v1
Wettability of graphite under 2D confinement,2022-05-16T14:00:13Z,"Zixuan Wei, Mara Chiricotto, Joshua D. Elliott, Fausto Martelli, Paola Carbone","The thermodynamics of solid/liquid interfaces under nanoconfinement has
tremendous implications for liquid transport properties. Here using molecular
dynamics, we investigate graphite nanoslits and study how the water/graphite
interfacial tension changes with the degree of confinement. We found that, for
nanochannel heights between 0.7nm and 2.6nm, graphite becomes more hydrophobic
than in bulk, and that the value of the surface tension oscillates before
eventually converging towards a constant value for larger slits. The value of
the surface tension is correlated with the slip length of the fluid and
explained in terms of the effective and interfacial density, hydration pressure
and friction coefficient. The study clearly indicates that there is a critical
channel height of 0.9nm (achievable experimentally1) at which the surface
tension reaches its highest value, but the water diffusion across the channel
is at its minimum. The structural analysis shows that for this pore size a
transition between a 2D and 3D hydrogen bond network is accompanied by an
abrupt increase in conformational entropy. Our results show that the
wettability of solid surfaces can change under nanoconfinement and the data can
be used to interpret the experimental permeability data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07693v1
Minimal Neural Network Models for Permutation Invariant Agents,2022-05-12T08:03:29Z,"Joachim Winther Pedersen, Sebastian Risi","Organisms in nature have evolved to exhibit flexibility in face of changes to
the environment and/or to themselves. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have
proven useful for controlling of artificial agents acting in environments.
However, most ANN models used for reinforcement learning-type tasks have a
rigid structure that does not allow for varying input sizes. Further, they fail
catastrophically if inputs are presented in an ordering unseen during
optimization. We find that these two ANN inflexibilities can be mitigated and
their solutions are simple and highly related. For permutation invariance, no
optimized parameters can be tied to a specific index of the input elements. For
size invariance, inputs must be projected onto a common space that does not
grow with the number of projections. Based on these restrictions, we construct
a conceptually simple model that exhibit flexibility most ANNs lack. We
demonstrate the model's properties on multiple control problems, and show that
it can cope with even very rapid permutations of input indices, as well as
changes in input size. Ablation studies show that is possible to achieve these
properties with simple feedforward structures, but that it is much easier to
optimize recurrent structures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07868v1

FRB repeater. Together, they suggest a highly variable magneto-active
circum-burst environment. In this paper, we report similar behavior in a
globular cluster pulsar binary system PSR B1744-24A. We observe irregular fast
changes of RM with both signs at random orbital phases as well as profile
changes of the circular polarization when the pulsar emission passes close to
the companion. The latter provides strong evidence for Faraday conversion and
circularly polarized attenuation. These similarities between PSR B1744-24A and
some FRB repeaters, as well as the possible binary-produced long-term

"Designing Observables for Quantum Interference in Jets at Subleading
  Color",2022-05-24T21:42:41Z,Andrew J. Larkoski,"The large-$N_c$ or topologically planar limit of gauge theories can be
considered as a classical limit because all gauge bosons are distinguishable
particles and therefore cannot exhibit interference. Quantum effects due to the
flow of color therefore arise starting at subleading in $1/N_c$. We introduce
kinematic observables explicitly sensitive to effects at subleading color
formed from the ratio of interfering to squared color-ordered amplitudes. Such
observables are in general not infrared and collinear safe, so we introduce
angular observables defined from appropriate multi-point energy correlators
motivated by the form of color-ordered amplitudes. We demonstrate that color
interference effects are manifest as sinusoidal oscillation in the simplest

predicting this observable in all-purpose, leading-color parton shower Monte

Toxicity Detection with Generative Prompt-based Inference,2022-05-24T22:44:43Z,"Yau-Shian Wang, Yingshan Chang","Due to the subtleness, implicity, and different possible interpretations
perceived by different people, detecting undesirable content from text is a
nuanced difficulty. It is a long-known risk that language models (LMs), once
trained on corpus containing undesirable content, have the power to manifest
biases and toxicity. However, recent studies imply that, as a remedy, LMs are
also capable of identifying toxic content without additional fine-tuning.
Prompt-methods have been shown to effectively harvest this surprising
self-diagnosing capability. However, existing prompt-based methods usually
specify an instruction to a language model in a discriminative way. In this
work, we explore the generative variant of zero-shot prompt-based toxicity
detection with comprehensive trials on prompt engineering. We evaluate on three
datasets with toxicity labels annotated on social media posts. Our analysis
highlights the strengths of our generative classification approach both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Interesting aspects of self-diagnosis and its

The waiting time distributions of individual monomer beads inside the channel
show unique features strongly dependent on the driving force and the surface

magnetar winds, close to the light cylinder. Pair plasmas in magnetic field is
birefringent, a $\propto B^2$ effect. As a result, such plasmas work as phase
retarders: Stokes parameters follow a circular trajectory on the Poincare
sphere. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega, \, \omega_p \ll \omega_B$,
the corresponding rotation rates are independent of the magnetic field. A
plasma screen with dispersion measure DM $\sim 10^{-6}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ can induce
large polarization changes, including large effective Rotation Measure (RM).
The frequency scaling of the (generalized) RM, $ \propto \lambda ^\alpha $,
mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha =2$ for small phase shifts, but can be
as small as $\alpha =1$. In interpreting observations the frequency scaling of
polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers
explanations for (i) large circular polarization component observed in FRBs,

analysis of belief evolution via horizontal and vertical transmission. We
analyze three cases: static network, randomly changing network, and
homophily-based dynamic network. Whereas the former two assume network
structure is independent of beliefs, the latter assumes that people tend to
communicate with those who have similar beliefs. We prove under general
conditions that both static and randomly changing networks converge to a single
set of beliefs among all individuals along with the rate of convergence. We

collisional behavior of dust aggregates. We performed numerical simulations of
collisions between two equal-mass dust aggregates with various collision
velocities and impact parameters. We also changed the strength of viscous
dissipation force systematically. We found that the threshold collision
velocity for the fragmentation of dust aggregates barely depends on the
strength of viscous dissipation force when we consider oblique collisions. In
contrast, the size distribution of fragments changes significantly when the
viscous dissipation force is considered. We obtained the empirical fitting

i.e. at zero temperature this is the $2\frac12$ order phase transition. Since
transitions of this kind in a normal metal are always associated to certain
topological changes, then below we clarify the topological nature of the
transition under consideration. Namely, we demonstrate that the topological
invariant which in process of the transition undergoes the change is nothing
but the Euler characteristic. Alternatively, in terms of the theory of
catastrophes one can relate this transition to appearance of the cuspidal edge
at the corresponding surface of the density of states as the function of energy

"STN: Scalable Tensorizing Networks via Structure-Aware Training and
  Adaptive Compression",2022-05-30T15:50:48Z,"Chang Nie, Huan Wang, Lu Zhao","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have delivered a remarkable performance in many
tasks of computer vision. However, over-parameterized representations of
popular architectures dramatically increase their computational complexity and
storage costs, and hinder their availability in edge devices with constrained
resources. Regardless of many tensor decomposition (TD) methods that have been
well-studied for compressing DNNs to learn compact representations, they suffer
from non-negligible performance degradation in practice. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Tensorizing Networks (STN), which dynamically and adaptively
adjust the model size and decomposition structure without retraining. First, we
account for compression during training by adding a low-rank regularizer to
guarantee networks' desired low-rank characteristics in full tensor format.
Then, considering network layers exhibit various low-rank structures, STN is
obtained by a data-driven adaptive TD approach, for which the topological
structure of decomposition per layer is learned from the pre-trained model, and
the ranks are selected appropriately under specified storage constraints. As a
result, STN is compatible with arbitrary network architectures and achieves
higher compression performance and flexibility over other tensorizing versions.
Comprehensive experiments on several popular architectures and benchmarks
substantiate the superiority of our model towards improving parameter
efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15198v1
A Categorical View on the Principle of Relativity,2022-05-25T17:05:48Z,"L. M. Gaio, B. F. Rizzuti","Category theory plays a special character in mathematics - it unifies
distinct branches under the same formalism. Despite this integrative power in
math, it also seems to provide the proper foundations to the experimental
physicist. In this work, we present another application of category in physics,
related to the principle of relativity. The operational construction of
(inertial) frames of reference indicates that only the movement between one and
another frame is enough to differentiate both of them. This fact is hidden when
one applies only group theory to connect frames. In fact, rotations and
translations only change coordinates, keeping the frame inert. The change of
frames is only attainable by boosts in the classical and relativistic regimes
for both Galileo and Lorentz (Poincar\'e) groups. Besides providing a
non-trivial example of application of category theory in physics, we also
fulfill the presented gap when one directly applies group theory for connecting
frames.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15408v2
On Low Rank Fusion Rings,2022-05-31T09:28:44Z,"Gert Vercleyen, Joost Slingerland","We present a method to generate all fusion rings of a specific rank and

Exceptional sequences in the derived category of a gentle algebra,2022-05-31T14:35:38Z,"Wen Chang, Sibylle Schroll","In this paper, using the correspondence of gentle algebras and dissections of
marked surfaces, we study full exceptional sequences in the perfect derived
category $\mathsf{K^b(A)}$ of a gentle algebra $\mathsf{A}$. We show that full
exceptional sequences in $\mathsf{K^b(A)}$ exist if and only if the associated
marked surface has no punctures and has at least two marked points on the
boundary. Furthermore, by using induction on cuts of surfaces, we characterise
when an exceptional sequence can be completed to a full exceptional sequence.
If the genus of the associated surface is zero then we show that the action of
the braid group together with the grading shift on full exceptional sequences
in $\mathsf{K^b(A)}$ is transitive. For the case of surfaces of higher genus,
we reduce the problem of transitivity to the problem of the existence of
certain sequences of pairs of exceptional objects. Finally, we interpret the

associated symmetric group using Koszul duality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15830v1
Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models,2022-06-01T10:03:24Z,"Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine","We argue that the theory and practice of diffusion-based generative models
are currently unnecessarily convoluted and seek to remedy the situation by
presenting a design space that clearly separates the concrete design choices.
This lets us identify several changes to both the sampling and training

improvements yield new state-of-the-art FID of 1.79 for CIFAR-10 in a
class-conditional setting and 1.97 in an unconditional setting, with much
faster sampling (35 network evaluations per image) than prior designs. To
further demonstrate their modular nature, we show that our design changes
dramatically improve both the efficiency and quality obtainable with
pre-trained score networks from previous work, including improving the FID of a
previously trained ImageNet-64 model from 2.07 to near-SOTA 1.55, and after
re-training with our proposed improvements to a new SOTA of 1.36.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364v2
In the Eye of the Beholder: Robust Prediction with Causal User Modeling,2022-06-01T11:33:57Z,"Amir Feder, Guy Horowitz, Yoav Wald, Roi Reichart, Nir Rosenfeld","Accurately predicting the relevance of items to users is crucial to the
success of many social platforms. Conventional approaches train models on
logged historical data; but recommendation systems, media services, and online

moving target, to which standard predictive models are not robust. In this
paper, we propose a learning framework for relevance prediction that is robust
to changes in the data distribution. Our key observation is that robustness can
be obtained by accounting for how users causally perceive the environment. We
model users as boundedly-rational decision makers whose causal beliefs are
encoded by a causal graph, and show how minimal information regarding the graph

CLIP4IDC: CLIP for Image Difference Captioning,2022-06-01T17:02:08Z,"Zixin Guo, Tzu-Jui Julius Wang, Jorma Laaksonen","Image Difference Captioning (IDC) aims at generating sentences to describe
differences between two similar-looking images. Conventional approaches learn
an IDC model with a pre-trained and usually frozen visual feature extractor.
Accordingly, two major issues may arise: (1) a large domain gap usually exists
between the pre-training datasets used for training such a visual encoder and
that of the downstream IDC task, and (2) the visual feature extractor, when
separately encoding two images, often does not effectively encode the visual
changes between two images. Due to the excellent zero-shot performance of the
recently proposed CLIP, we thus propose CLIP4IDC to transfer a CLIP model for
the IDC task to address those issues. Different from directly fine-tuning CLIP
to generate sentences, we introduce an adaptation training process to adapt
CLIP's visual encoder to capture and align differences in image pairs based on
the textual descriptions. Experiments on three IDC benchmark datasets,

The Phenomenon of Policy Churn,2022-06-01T19:44:18Z,"Tom Schaul, André Barreto, John Quan, Georg Ostrovski","We identify and study the phenomenon of policy churn, that is, the rapid
change of the greedy policy in value-based reinforcement learning. Policy churn
operates at a surprisingly rapid pace, changing the greedy action in a large
fraction of states within a handful of learning updates (in a typical deep RL
set-up such as DQN on Atari). We characterise the phenomenon empirically,
verifying that it is not limited to specific algorithm or environment
properties. A number of ablations help whittle down the plausible explanations
on why churn occurs to just a handful, all related to deep learning. Finally,
we hypothesise that policy churn is a beneficial but overlooked form of
implicit exploration that casts $\epsilon$-greedy exploration in a fresh light,
namely that $\epsilon$-noise plays a much smaller role than expected.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00730v3

Second, they do not clearly distinguish between text-required and

limitations, we propose: (i) a Dynamic Editing Block (DEBlock) which composes
different editing modules dynamically for various editing requirements. (ii) a
Composition Predictor (Comp-Pred) which predicts the composition weights for
DEBlock according to the inference on target texts and source images. (iii) a

Online FDR Control for RNAseq Data,2022-06-05T16:34:49Z,"Lathan Liou, Milena Hornburg, David S. Robertson","Motivation: While the analysis of a single RNA sequencing (RNAseq) dataset
has been well described in the literature, modern research workflows often have
additional complexity in that related RNAseq experiments are performed
sequentially over time. The simplest and most widely used analysis strategy
ignores the temporal aspects and analyses each dataset separately. However,
this can lead to substantial inflation of the overall false discovery rate
(FDR). We propose applying recently developed methodology for online hypothesis
testing to analyse sequential RNAseq experiments in a principled way,
guaranteeing FDR control at all times while never changing past decisions.
Results: We show that standard offline approaches have variable control of FDR
of related RNAseq experiments over time and a naively composed approach may
improperly change historic decisions. We demonstrate that the online FDR

upper bounds on the generalization error of statistical distributed learning
algorithms. Specifically, there are $K$ clients whose individually chosen
models are aggregated by a central server. The bounds depend on the
compressibility of each client's algorithm while keeping other clients'
algorithms un-compressed, and leverage the fact that small changes in each
local model change the aggregated model by a factor of only $1/K$. Adopting a
recently proposed approach by Sefidgaran et al., and extending it suitably to
the distributed setting, this enables smaller rate-distortion terms which are
shown to translate into tighter generalization bounds. The bounds are then
applied to the distributed support vector machines (SVM), suggesting that the
generalization error of the distributed setting decays faster than that of the
centralized one with a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\log(K)/\sqrt{K})$. This finding
is validated also experimentally. A similar conclusion is obtained for a

complex trade-offs encountered when trying to decide not just which roads to
follow, but also when to change between the lanes making up these roads, in
order to -- for example -- reduce the likelihood of missing a left exit while
not unnecessarily driving in the leftmost lane. This routing problem can
naturally be formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which lane
change actions have stochastic outcomes. However, MDPs are known to be
time-consuming to solve in general. In this paper, we show that -- under

TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction

single-subband nanowires and show that spin pumping is robustly quantized when
the hybrid nanowire is in the topologically nontrivial phase, whereas charge
pumping is not quantized. Moreover, there exists one-to-one correspondence
between the quantized conductance, entropy change and spin pumping in long
topologically nontrivial nanowires but these observables are uncorrelated in
the case of accidental zero-energy Andreev bound states in the trivial phase.
Thus, we conclude that observation of correlated and quantized peaks in the
conductance, entropy change and spin pumping would provide strong evidence of
Majorana zero modes, and we elaborate how topological Majorana zero modes can
be distinguished from quasi-Majorana modes potentially created by a smooth
tunnel barrier at the lead-nanowire interface. Finally, we discuss peculiar
interference effects affecting the spin pumping in short nanowires at very low
energies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03527v2
Thermal ion kinetic effects and Landau damping in fishbone modes,2022-06-08T02:34:00Z,"Chang Liu, Stephen C. Jardin, Jian Bao, Nikolai Gorelenkov, Dylan P. Brennan, James Yang, Mario Podesta","The kinetic-MHD hybrid simulation approach for macroscopic instabilities in
plasmas can be extended to include the kinetic effects of both thermal ions and
energetic ions. The new coupling scheme includes synchronization of density and
parallel velocity between thermal ions and MHD, in addition to pressure
coupling, to ensure the quasineutrality condition and avoid numerical errors.
The new approach has been implemented in the kinetic-MHD code M3D-C1-K, and was
used to study the thermal ion kinetic effects and Landau damping in fishbone
modes in both DIII-D and NSTX. It is found that the thermal ion kinetic effects
can cause an increase of the frequencies of the non-resonant $n=1$ fishbone
modes driven by energetic particles for $q_\mathrm{min}>1$, and Landau damping
can provide additional stabilization effects. A nonlinear simulation for $n=1$

ways to maintain algorithmic fairness over time. One line of work focuses on
dynamic learning: retraining after each batch, and the other on robust learning

Dynamic learning seeks to reduce biases soon after they have occurred and
robust learning often yields (overly) conservative models. We propose an
anticipatory dynamic learning approach for correcting the algorithm to mitigate
bias before it occurs. Specifically, we make use of anticipations regarding the
relative distributions of population subgroups (e.g., relative ratios of male

mean-field description of a large number of interacting neurons, which has
attracted mathematicians to study from various aspects. A core property of this

corresponds to the synchronization of a neuron network, and mathematically
prevents the existence of a global classical solution. In this work, we propose
a new generalized solution based on reformulating the PDE model with a specific
change of variable in time. A firing rate dependent timescale is introduced, in
which the transformed equation can be shown to be globally well-posed for any
connectivity parameter even in the event of the blow-up. The generalized
solution is then defined via the backward change of timescale, and it may have
a jump when the firing rate blows up. We establish properties of the
generalized solution including the characterization of blow-ups and the global
well-posedness in the original timescale. The generalized solution provides a
new perspective to understand the dynamics when the firing rate blows up as

convolutional filters are inappropriate on non-flat topologies. To close this
gap, we implement a surface-based CycleGAN using mixture model CNNs (MoNet) to
translate sphericalised neonatal cortical surface features (curvature and

Addressing drifts is particularly imperative in the security domain due to the

concept drift detection methods in literature tackle this problem by
identifying the changes in feature/data distributions and periodically
retraining the models to learn new concepts. While these types of strategies

attacker-induced drifts and suffer from a delay in detecting new attacks. We
aim to address these shortcomings in this work. we propose a robust drift
detector that not only identifies drifted samples but also discovers new
classes as they arrive in an on-line fashion. We evaluate the proposed method

experiment ELM combined with MAP-Elites generates hundreds of thousands of
functional examples of Python programs that output working ambulating robots in
the Sodarace domain, which the original LLM had never seen in pre-training.

bootstrap new models that can output appropriate artifacts for a given context

a century ago. The H-deficient ejecta has experienced a considerable
brightening in the time period considered, from 1996 to 2021, with notable
changes also in many emission line ratios. Neither the reduction of the
extinction caused by the dilution of the ejecta nor the increase of the

Structure and Stability of the Indian Power Transmission Network,2022-06-21T13:17:49Z,"Vedang Tamhane, G. Ambika","We present the study on the Indian power transmission network using the
framework of a complex network and quantify its structural properties. For
this, we build the network structure underlying the Indian power grid, using
two of its most prevalent power lines. We construct an equivalent model of an
exponential network and study its structural changes with changes in two
parameters related to redundancy and dead-ends. Then we analyze its stability
against cascading failures by varying these two parameters using the link
failure model. This helps to gain insight into the relation of network topology
to its stability, and indicates how the optimum choice of these parameters can
result in a power grid structure with minimum failed links. We apply the same
model to study the robustness of the Indian power grid against such failures.
In this case, we find that when a link connected to a generator fails, it
results in a cascade that spreads in the grid until it is split into two
separate stable clusters of generators and consumers, with over one-third of
its nodes nonfunctiona",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10366v2

that rate-limiting of a nonlinear mechanism does not preclude amplification,

the distances between the terminals up to factor $1+\varepsilon$. We construct
the first $\varepsilon$-emulators for planar graphs of near-linear size $\tilde

have shown the absence of appropriate tuning, specifically in the presence of
semantic shift, can hinder robustness of the underlying methods. However,
little is known about the practical effect this sensitivity may have on
downstream longitudinal analyses. We explore this gap in the literature through
a timely case study: understanding shifts in depression during the course of

model-based car-following policy, lane-changing policy, and the RL policy, to
ensure safe operation of a CV. Subsequently, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is
formulated, which enables the vehicle to perform longitudinal control and
lateral decisions, jointly optimizing the car-following and lane-changing
behaviors of the CVs in the vicinity of intersections. Then, the hybrid action
space is parameterized as a hierarchical structure and thereby trains the
agents with two-dimensional motion patterns in a dynamic traffic environment.
Finally, our proposed methods are evaluated in SUMO software from both a

Variable-Depth Simulation of Most Permissive Boolean Networks,2022-06-25T20:41:10Z,"Théo Roncalli, Loïc Paulevé","In systems biology, Boolean networks (BNs) aim at modeling the qualitative
dynamics of quantitative biological systems. Contrary to their (a)synchronous
interpretations, the Most Permissive (MP) interpretation guarantees capturing
all the trajectories of any quantitative system compatible with the BN, without
additional parameters. Notably, the MP mode has the ability to capture
transitions related to the heterogeneity of time scales and concentration
scales in the abstracted quantitative system and which are not captured by
asynchronous modes. So far, the analysis of MPBNs has focused on Boolean
dynamical properties, such as the existence of particular trajectories or
attractors. This paper addresses the sampling of trajectories from MPBNs in
order to quantify the propensities of attractors reachable from a given initial
BN configuration. The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is
performed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of
iterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth
corresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the
potential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted
quantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models
from the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the
robustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model
perturbations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12729v1

discussed. When the spacetime dimensions increase, the change of entanglement
becomes slower with time. The influence of spacetime dimensions on the change

for entanglement generation is shown in different spacetime dimensions. In
particular, entanglement decreases more quickly with the increasing spacetime

be explained by the merging of previously disconnected sites that occurred
after the disease jumped (nonlocally) to a relatively small number of separated
sites. Subsequent variations in the slope with continued growth can
qualitatively be explained as a result of reinfections and changes in their
rate. We demonstrate that the observed behavior can be described by a standard
epidemiological model with spatial extent and reinfections included.
Time-dependent changes in the spatial diffusion coefficient can also model
corresponding variations in the slope.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15459v2
"An adaptive bi-objective optimization algorithm for the satellite image
  data downlink scheduling problem considering request split",2022-06-28T15:37:34Z,"Zhongxiang Chang, Abraham P. Punnen, Zhongbao Zhou","The satellite image data downlink scheduling problem (SIDSP) is well studied
in literature for traditional satellites. With recent developments in satellite
technology, SIDSP for modern satellites became more complicated, adding new
dimensions of complexities and additional opportunities for the effective use
of the satellite. In this paper, we introduce the dynamic two-phase satellite
image data downlink scheduling problem (D-SIDSP) which combines two interlinked
operations of image data segmentation and image data downlink, in a dynamic
way, and thereby offering additional modelling flexibility and renewed
capabilities. D-SIDSP is formulated as a bi-objective problem of optimizing the
image data transmission rate and the service-balance degree. Harnessing the
power of an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS) with a
nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), an adaptive bi-objective
memetic algorithm, ALNS+NSGA-II, is developed to solve D-SIDSP. Results of
extensive computational experiments carried out using benchmark instances are
also presented. Our experimental results disclose that the algorithm
ALNS+NSGA-II is a viable alternative to solve D-SIDSP more efficiently and
demonstrates superior outcomes based on various performance metrics. The paper
also offers new benchmark instances for D-SIDSP that can be used in future
research works on the topic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00168v1
CEDAR: Communication Efficient Distributed Analysis for Regressions,2022-07-01T09:53:44Z,"Changgee Chang, Zhiqi Bu, Qi Long","Electronic health records (EHRs) offer great promises for advancing precision
medicine and, at the same time, present significant analytical challenges.
Particularly, it is often the case that patient-level data in EHRs cannot be
shared across institutions (data sources) due to government regulations and/or
institutional policies. As a result, there are growing interests about
distributed learning over multiple EHRs databases without sharing patient-level
data. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel communication efficient
method that aggregates the local optimal estimates, by turning the problem into
a missing data problem. In addition, we propose incorporating posterior samples
of remote sites, which can provide partial information on the missing
quantities and improve efficiency of parameter estimates while having the
differential privacy property and thus reducing the risk of information
leaking. The proposed approach, without sharing the raw patient level data,
allows for proper statistical inference and can accommodate sparse regressions.
We provide theoretical investigation for the asymptotic properties of the
proposed method for statistical inference as well as differential privacy, and
evaluate its performance in simulations and real data analyses in comparison
with several recently developed methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00306v1

challenge of small $n$ and large $p$ that is often encountered in analysis of
big biomedical data such as genomics data. Detection of weak yet important
signals can be enhanced by jointly selecting features for all datasets.
However, the set of important features may not always be the same across all
datasets. Although some existing integrative learning methods allow
heterogeneous sparsity structure where a subset of datasets can have zero
coefficients for some selected features, they tend to yield reduced efficiency,
reinstating the problem of losing weak important signals. We propose a new
integrative learning approach which can not only aggregate important signals
well in homogeneous sparsity structure, but also substantially alleviate the
problem of losing weak important signals in heterogeneous sparsity structure.
Our approach exploits a priori known graphical structure of features and
encourages joint selection of features that are connected in the graph.
Integrating such prior information over multiple datasets enhances the power,
while also accounting for the heterogeneity across datasets. Theoretical
properties of the proposed method are investigated. We also demonstrate the
limitations of existing approaches and the superiority of our method using a
simulation study and analysis of gene expression data from ADNI.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00310v1

the frequency of optical phonons at the zone center tend to decrease with
increasing size of the nanowire. Investigation of the phonon scattering rates
has revealed very high values in the smallest sample which decrease with
increasing nanowire size. A remarkable change in scattering rates is shown for
increasing diameter from 0.53 and 0.78 nm to 0.86 nm. The higher phonon

declined, and a diversion effect in which some migrants substituted to the
Western Mediterranean route. At the same time, smugglers adapted their tactics.
Using a strategic model of the smuggler's choice of boat size, we estimate how

found to stem from changes of their topology. These findings, together with two
theorems, have suggested that a topological theory of phase transitions can be
formulated to go beyond the limits of the existing theories. Among other
advantages, the new theory applies to phase transitions in small $N$ systems

symmetry-breaking. However, the preliminary version of the theory was

Origin of the Coulomb Pseudopotential,2022-07-12T00:34:29Z,"Tao Wang, Xiansheng Cai, Kun Chen, Boris V. Svistunov, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev","We address the outstanding problem of electron pairing in the presence of
strong Coulomb repulsion at small to moderate values of the Coulomb parameter,
$r_s \lesssim 2$, and demonstrate that the pseudopotential framework is
fundamentally biased and uncontrolled. Instead, one has to break the net result
into two distinctively different effects: the Fermi liquid renormalization
factor and the change in the effective low-energy coupling. The latter quantity
is shown to behave non-monotonically with an extremum at $ r_s\approx 0.75$.
Within the random-phase approximation, Coulomb interaction starts to enhance
the effective pairing coupling at $r_s >2$, and the suppression of the critical
temperature is entirely due to the renormalized Fermi liquid properties.
Leading vertex corrections change this picture only quantitatively. Our results
call for radical reconsideration of the widely accepted repulsive
pseudopotential approach and show the need for precise microscopic treatment of
Coulomb interactions in the problem of superconducting instability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05238v4

the locations of photon sphere and ESCO in CMO phase with Minkowskian core are

  Sketch-Based Face Image Generation",2022-07-17T04:05:17Z,"Zhihua Cheng, Xuejin Chen","Sketching is an intuitive and effective way for content creation. While
significant progress has been made for photorealistic image generation by using
generative adversarial networks, it remains challenging to take a fine-grained
control on synthetic content. The instance normalization layer, which is widely
adopted in existing image translation networks, washes away details in the
input sketch and leads to loss of precise control on the desired shape of the
generated face images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect
of instance normalization on generating photorealistic face images from
hand-drawn sketches. We first introduce a visualization approach to analyze the
feature embedding for sketches with a group of specific changes. Based on the
visual analysis, we modify the instance normalization layers in the baseline

Vaccination shapes evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2,2022-07-19T15:28:51Z,"Matthijs Meijers, Denis Ruchnewitz, Marta Łuksza, Michael Lässig","The large-scale evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been marked by rapid
turnover of genetic clades. New variants show intrinsic changes, notably
increased transmissibility, as well as antigenic changes that reduce the
cross-immunity induced by previous infections or vaccinations. How this
functional variation shapes the global evolutionary dynamics has remained
unclear. Here we show that selection induced by vaccination impacts on the
recent antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2; other relevant forces include
intrinsic selection and antigenic selection induced by previous infections. We

epidemiological records, and cross-neutralisation assays. This model accurately
captures the large-scale evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple

of various customized datasets, we propose an end-to-end multimodal transformer
(MTrans) autolabeler, which leverages both LiDAR scans and images to generate
precise 3D box annotations from weak 2D bounding boxes. To alleviate the
pervasive sparsity problem that hinders existing autolabelers, MTrans densifies
the sparse point clouds by generating new 3D points based on 2D image
information. With a multi-task design, MTrans segments the
foreground/background, densifies LiDAR point clouds, and regresses 3D boxes
simultaneously. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the MTrans for
improving the quality of the generated labels. By enriching the sparse point

Accounting for Seasonality in Extreme Sea Level Estimation,2022-07-20T13:10:12Z,"Eleanor D'Arcy, Jonathan A. Tawn, Amélie Joly, Dafni E. Sifnioti","Reliable estimates of sea level return levels are crucial for coastal
flooding risk assessments and for coastal flood defence design. We describe a
novel method for estimating extreme sea levels that is the first to capture
seasonality, interannual variations and longer term changes. We use a joint
probabilities method, with skew surge and peak tide as two sea level
components. The tidal regime is predictable but skew surges are stochastic. We
present a statistical model for skew surges, where the main body of the
distribution is modelled empirically whilst a non-stationary generalised Pareto
distribution (GPD) is used for the upper tail. We capture within-year
seasonality by introducing a daily covariate to the GPD model and allowing the
distribution of peak tides to change over months and years. Skew surge-peak
tide dependence is accounted for via a tidal covariate in the GPD model and we
adjust for skew surge temporal dependence through the subasymptotic extremal
index. We incorporate spatial prior information in our GPD model to reduce the
uncertainty associated with the highest return level estimates. Our results are
an improvement on current return level estimates, with previous methods
typically underestimating. We illustrate our method at four UK tide gauges.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09870v1
"Braiding with Majorana lattices: Groundstate degeneracy and

fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Scalable qubit designs require
several Majorana modes localized on quantum wires networks, with braiding
operations relying on the presence of the groundstate degeneracy of the
topologically nontrivial superconducting phase. However, this degeneracy is
lifted due to the hybridization between Majorana modes localized at a finite
distance. Here, we describe a braiding protocol in a trijunction where each
branch consists of a lattice of Majorana modes overlapping at a finite
distance. We find that the energy splitting between the groundstate and the
lowest-energy state decreases exponentially with the number of Majorana modes
if the system is in its topologically nontrivial regime. This result does not
rely on the specific braiding geometry and on the details of the braiding

through the variables of the input formula in random order; each variable is
then set randomly to $0$ or $1$, unless the correct value can be inferred by an
efficiently implementable rule (like small-width resolution; or being implied
by a small set of clauses). We show that PPSZ performs exponentially better
than previously known, for all $k \geq 3$. For Unique-$3$-SAT we bound its
running time by $O(1.306973^{n})$, which is somewhat better than the algorithm

that, the best known upper bound for Unique-$3$-SAT was $O(1.3070319^n)$. All

Taking the axial thermal convection model of the solar polar region, it can
generate axial differential rotation, and the centrifugal force difference

prediction of materials properties, generating sufficient data to reliably
train models without overfitting is still impractical for many applications.
Towards overcoming this limitation, we present a general framework for
leveraging complementary information across different models and datasets for
accurate prediction of data scarce materials properties. Our approach, based on
a machine learning paradigm called mixture of experts, outperforms pairwise
transfer learning on 16 of 19 materials property regression tasks, performing
comparably on the remaining three. Unlike pairwise transfer learning, our
framework automatically learns to combine information from multiple source
tasks in a single training run, alleviating the need for brute-force
experiments to determine which source task to transfer from. The approach also
provides an interpretable, model-agnostic, and scalable mechanism to transfer
information from an arbitrary number of models and datasets to any downstream
property prediction task. We anticipate the performance of our framework will
further improve as better model architectures, new pre-training tasks, and
larger materials datasets are developed by the community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13880v1
"Unlocking device-scale atomistic modelling of phase-change memory
  materials",2022-07-28T16:55:53Z,"Yuxing Zhou, Wei Zhang, En Ma, Volker L. Deringer","Quantum-accurate computer simulations play a central role in understanding
phase-change materials (PCMs) for advanced memory technologies. However, direct
quantum-mechanical simulations are necessarily limited to simplified models,
containing no more than a few hundred or a thousand atoms. Machine learning
(ML) based potential models that are ""trained"" on quantum-mechanical data are
an emerging alternative approach, currently evolving from highly specialised to
more widely applied simulation tools. Here we show that a universal,
compositionally flexible ML model can describe a wide range of flagship
Ge-Sb-Te PCMs under real device conditions, including non-isothermal heating
and chemical disorder which are relevant for memory applications. The speed of
the ML model enables atomistic simulations of multiple thermal cycles and
delicate operations for neuro-inspired computing, namely, cumulative SET and
iterative RESET. A device-scale capability demonstration (40 x 20 x 20 nm3)
shows that the new ML potential can directly describe technologically relevant
processes in PCM-based memory products. In a wider context, our work
demonstrates how ML-driven materials simulations are now entering a stage where
they can guide architecture design for high-performance electronic devices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14228v2
"What X-ray absorption spectroscopy can tell us about the active state of
  earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction",2022-07-28T19:31:04Z,"Marcel Risch, Dulce M. Morales, Javier Villalobos, Denis Antipin","Chemical energy storage is an attractive solution to secure a sustainable
energy supply. It requires an electrocatalyst to be implemented efficiently. In
order to rationally improve the electrocatalyst materials and thereby the
reaction efficiency, one must reveal the nature of the electrocatalyst under
reaction conditions, i.e., its active state. For a better understanding of
earth-abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has been very insightful and still holds untapped
potential. Herein, we concisely introduce the basics of EC and XAS and provide
the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials
undergo, presenting manganese oxides as examples. Such changes may occur during
preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during
application of potentials without or with catalytic reactions. We conclude with
a concise summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate the
active state as well as an outlook on future opportunities to understand the
mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC-XAS experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14360v1

correlates and their changes across the three phases of a 3D-MOT task, namely
identification, tracking and recall. We recorded the EEG activity of 24
participants while they were performing a 3D-MOT task with either 1, 2 or 3

seems to be a handoff between focused attention and working memory processes
when going from tracking to recall. Our findings revealed a strong inhibition
in delta and theta frequencies from the frontal region during tracking,
followed by a strong (re)activation of these same frequencies during recall.

Matching with AffNet based rectifications,2022-07-29T13:06:18Z,"Václav Vávra, Dmytro Mishkin, Jiří Matas","We consider the problem of two-view matching under significant viewpoint
changes with view synthesis. We propose two novel methods, minimizing the view

partition with just a single affine map. The second one, named DepthAffNet,
combines information from depth maps and affine shapes estimates to produce
different sets of rectifying affine maps for different image partitions.
DenseAffNet is faster than the state-of-the-art and more accurate on generic

Renting Edge Computing Resources for Service Hosting,2022-07-29T14:00:17Z,"Aadesh Madnaik, Sharayu Moharir, Nikhil Karamchandani","We consider the setting where a service is hosted on a third-party edge
server deployed close to the users and a cloud server at a greater distance
from the users. Due to the proximity of the edge servers to the users, requests
can be served at the edge with low latency. However, as the computation
resources at the edge are limited, some requests must be routed to the cloud
for service and incur high latency. The system's overall performance depends on
the rent cost incurred to use the edge server, the latency experienced by the
users, and the cost incurred to change the amount of edge computation resources
rented over time. The algorithmic challenge is to determine the amount of edge
computation power to rent over time. We propose a deterministic online policy
and characterize its performance for adversarial and stochastic i.i.d. request
arrival processes. We also characterize a fundamental bound on the performance
of any deterministic online policy. Further, we compare the performance of our
policy with suitably modified versions of existing policies to conclude that
our policy is robust to temporal changes in the intensity of request arrivals.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14690v2
Relatively Anosov representations via flows I: theory,2022-07-29T15:15:47Z,"Feng Zhu, Andrew Zimmer","This is the first in a series of two papers that develops a theory of

in the second paper we will focus on examples. In the case of relatively
hyperbolic groups, this bundle construction involves several choices: the model
Gromov-hyperbolic space the group acts on and the norms on the fibers of the

DRSOM: A Dimension Reduced Second-Order Method,2022-07-30T13:05:01Z,"Chuwen Zhang, Dongdong Ge, Chang He, Bo Jiang, Yuntian Jiang, Yinyu Ye","In this paper, we propose a Dimension-Reduced Second-Order Method (DRSOM) for
convex and nonconvex (unconstrained) optimization. Under a trust-region-like

computational overhead of our method remains comparable to the first-order such
as the gradient descent method. Theoretically, we show that the method has a
local quadratic convergence and a global convergence rate of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ to satisfy the first-order and second-order conditions if
the subspace satisfies a commonly adopted approximated Hessian assumption. We
further show that this assumption can be removed if we perform a corrector step

  Flow",2022-07-30T15:11:57Z,"Hongyi Xiao, Zhekai Deng, Julio M. Ottino, Paul B. Umbanhowar, Richard M. Lueptow","We present a continuum approach to model segregation of size-bidisperse
granular materials in unsteady bounded heap flow as a prototype for modeling
segregation in other time varying flows. In experiments, a periodically
modulated feed rate produces stratified segregation like that which occurs due
to intermittent avalanching, except with greater layer-uniformity and higher
average feed rates. Using an advection-diffusion-segregation equation and
characterizing transient changes in deposition and erosion after a feed rate
change, we model stratification for varying feed rates and periods. Feed rate
modulation in heap flows can create well-segregated layers, which effectively
mix the deposited material normal to the free surface at lengths greater than
the combined layer-thickness. This mitigates the strong streamwise segregation
that would otherwise occur at larger particle-size ratios and equivalent steady
feed rates and can significantly reduce concentration variation during hopper
discharge. Coupling segregation, deposition and erosion is challenging but has
many potential applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00245v1
"Modeling the Role that Habitat Overlap Shape has on the Spread of
  Brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem",2022-07-31T00:02:09Z,Dustin Padilla,"Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infectious disease that affects livestock
and wildlife. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is the last area in the United
States where cattle are regularly infected with brucellosis. Even though
livestock are vaccinated, interactions with reservoir species still result in
spill-over cases to cattle. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine has indicated that modeling efforts should focus on the transmission
between elk and cattle and should be conducted to better understand the effects
of land-use change and landscape configuration on disease risk. This chapter
determines how the landscape's configuration, using the shape and amount of
habitat overlap between elk and cattle, contributes to cross-species
brucellosis transmission, and how land-use change translates to disease
prevalence. A mathematical-epidemiological model is combined with landscape
ecology metrics to estimate transmission rates between the species and model
disease spread. The results of this study can ultimately help stakeholders
develop policy for controlling brucellosis transmission between livestock and
elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area. In turn, this could lead to less disease
prevalence, reduce associated costs, and assist in population management.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00325v1

measurements of the power consumption, the ignition behavior by an ICCD-camera
and ozone formation by absorption spectroscopy at 254 nm. To evaluate the
biocidal effect, four bacterial test series were performed with Escherichia

the input parameters to the desired biocidal effect. The discharge current and
time resolved ignition behaviors indicated a simultaneous formation of
filaments at the beginning of the negative half-cycle. The dynamics of the
ozone production showed a saturated exponential growth upon a maximum value of
435 ppm. Additionally, the microbiological test series unveiled differences
between the plasma source concepts. A total reduction rate of Log-4 within a
minute was achievable. An air flow through slits within the plasma sources
destabilized the plasma. Minor changes of the electrode geometry changed all
measured parameters. Hence, to develop a pathogen inactivating plasma source,

Risk in Network Economies,2022-08-02T14:05:10Z,Victor Sellemi,"Economic models with input-output networks assume that firm or sector (unit)
growth is driven by a weighted sum of trade partners' growth and an
independently-drawn idiosyncratic shock. I show that the idiosyncratic risk
assumption in a broad class of network models implicitly generates restrictions
on the network weights which are unrealistic. When allowing for correlated
shocks, units are exposed to an additional risk term which captures the ability
to substitute away from supply and demand shocks propagating through the
network. I provide empirical evidence that changes in substitutability between
trade partners are inversely related to changes in the panel of realized
industry variance. Moreover, I find that supply-side (demand-side)
substitutability is closely related to technological (product) dispersion of a
unit's suppliers (customers). To synthesize these results, I propose a
production-based asset pricing model in which supply chain substitutability is
a function of dispersion in product/technology space and correlation in supply
and demand shocks is driven by shared customers and suppliers between firms.
The model predicts that assets which are positively exposed to average
propagation of upstream and downstream shocks are useful hedges and thus earn
lower average risk premia. Consistently, I find that estimated upstream
(downstream) propagation factors earn return spreads of -11.4% (-4.2%) and are
negatively associated with aggregate consumption, output, and dividend growth.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01467v1

environments during deployment. However, they usually do not incorporate the
underlying environmental factor information that the agents interact with
properly and thus can be overly conservative when facing changes in the
surroundings. In this paper, we first formalize the task of adapting to

"Synthetic Aperture Radar Image Change Detection via Layer
  Attention-Based Noise-Tolerant Network",2022-08-09T01:04:39Z,"Desen Meng, Feng Gao, Junyu Dong, Qian Du, Heng-Chao Li","Recently, change detection methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images
based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have gained increasing research
attention. However, existing CNN-based methods neglect the interactions among
multilayer convolutions, and errors involved in the preclassification restrict
the network optimization. To this end, we proposed a layer attention-based
noise-tolerant network, termed LANTNet. In particular, we design a layer
attention module that adaptively weights the feature of different convolution
layers. In addition, we design a noise-tolerant loss function that effectively
suppresses the impact of noisy labels. Therefore, the model is insensitive to
noisy labels in the preclassification results. The experimental results on
three SAR datasets show that the proposed LANTNet performs better compared to
several state-of-the-art methods. The source codes are available at

real-world traffic system with traffic operation actions like traffic signal
control or reversible lane changing, the system's state is influenced by both
the historical states and the actions of traffic operations. In this paper, we

network-level traffic flows from sparse data. DTIGNN models the traffic system

electromagnetic methods, we investigate the lasing conditions and the
electric-tunability of radiative and non radiative propagating surface-plasmon
modes in cylinders made of active materials coated with a graphene layer. A
detailed analysis of the lasing condition of different surface-plasmon modes
shows that there is an abrupt change in the gain required when modes become
nonradiative. Although radiative modes, subject to both radiation and ohmic
losses, are expected to require more gain compensation than nonradiative modes,
we find that, counterintuitively, gain compensation is greater for nonradiative
modes. This is explained in terms of a change in the distribution of fields
that occurs when the character of modes switches from plasmonic to photonic.
Finally, we assess the feasibility of our proposal by using a realist gain

Shift Variance in Scene Text Detection,2022-08-19T09:11:28Z,"Markus Glitzner, Jan-Hendrik Neudeck, Philipp Härtinger","Theory of convolutional neural networks suggests the property of shift
equivariance, i.e., that a shifted input causes an equally shifted output. In
practice, however, this is not always the case. This poses a great problem for
scene text detection for which a consistent spatial response is crucial,
irrespective of the position of the text in the scene.
  Using a simple synthetic experiment, we demonstrate the inherent shift
variance of a state-of-the-art fully convolutional text detector. Furthermore,
using the same experimental setting, we show how small architectural changes
can lead to an improved shift equivariance and less variation of the detector
output. We validate the synthetic results using a real-world training schedule
on the text detection network. To quantify the amount of shift variability, we
propose a metric based on well-established text detection benchmarks.
  While the proposed architectural changes are not able to fully recover shift
equivariance, adding smoothing filters can substantially improve shift
consistency on common text datasets. Considering the potentially large impact
of small shifts, we propose to extend the commonly used text detection metrics

Hadro-chemistry effects on charm decayed leptons in heavy-ion collisions,2022-08-20T04:28:58Z,"Kai Lu, Min He","Charm-hadrons possess versatile hadro-chemistry as characterized by various
transverse-momentum-dependent ratios between their different species. In
particular, the charm hadro-chemistry may be modified in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions with respect to proton-proton collisions at the same energy, as
caused by novel diffusion and hadronization mechanisms of charm quarks in the
environment of the created quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the former. Inspired by
recent measurements of leptons from charm-hadron decays (separated from bottom
decays) in Pb-Pb and Au-Au collisions, we investigate the effects of the charm
hadro-chemistry on the leptonic observables. We find that full consideration of
charm hadro-chemistry in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions causes
only mild change of charm-leptons' suppression factor with respect to previous
calculations hadronizing charm quarks into $D$ mesons only, whereas the
resulting change (increase) in the charm-leptons' elliptic flow turns out to be
more pronounced as a consequence of the larger collectivity of $\Lambda_c$
baryons than $D$ mesons.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09605v1
Visualising Model Training via Vowel Space for Text-To-Speech Systems,2022-08-21T01:33:24Z,"Binu Abeysinghe, Jesin James, Catherine I. Watson, Felix Marattukalam","With the recent developments in speech synthesis via machine learning, this
study explores incorporating linguistics knowledge to visualise and evaluate
synthetic speech model training. If changes to the first and second formant (in
turn, the vowel space) can be seen and heard in synthetic speech, this
knowledge can inform speech synthesis technology developers. A speech synthesis
model trained on a large General American English database was fine-tuned into
a New Zealand English voice to identify if the changes in the vowel space of
synthetic speech could be seen and heard. The vowel spaces at different
intervals during the fine-tuning were analysed to determine if the model
learned the New Zealand English vowel space. Our findings based on vowel space
analysis show that we can visualise how a speech synthesis model learns the
vowel space of the database it is trained on. Perception tests confirmed that
humans could perceive when a speech synthesis model has learned characteristics
of the speech database it is training on. Using the vowel space as an
intermediary evaluation helps understand what sounds are to be added to the
training database and build speech synthesis models based on linguistics

TaCo: Textual Attribute Recognition via Contrastive Learning,2022-08-22T09:45:34Z,"Chang Nie, Yiqing Hu, Yanqiu Qu, Hao Liu, Deqiang Jiang, Bo Ren","As textual attributes like font are core design elements of document format
and page style, automatic attributes recognition favor comprehensive practical
applications. Existing approaches already yield satisfactory performance in
differentiating disparate attributes, but they still suffer in distinguishing
similar attributes with only subtle difference. Moreover, their performance
drop severely in real-world scenarios where unexpected and obvious imaging
distortions appear. In this paper, we aim to tackle these problems by proposing
TaCo, a contrastive framework for textual attribute recognition tailored toward
the most common document scenes. Specifically, TaCo leverages contrastive
learning to dispel the ambiguity trap arising from vague and open-ended
attributes. To realize this goal, we design the learning paradigm from three
perspectives: 1) generating attribute views, 2) extracting subtle but crucial
details, and 3) exploiting valued view pairs for learning, to fully unlock the
pre-training potential. Extensive experiments show that TaCo surpasses the
supervised counterparts and advances the state-of-the-art remarkably on
multiple attribute recognition tasks. Online services of TaCo will be made
available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10180v1
"Learnable human mesh triangulation for 3D human pose and shape
  estimation",2022-08-24T01:11:57Z,"Sungho Chun, Sungbum Park, Ju Yong Chang","Compared to joint position, the accuracy of joint rotation and shape
estimation has received relatively little attention in the skinned multi-person
linear model (SMPL)-based human mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. The
work in this field is broadly classified into two categories. The first
approach performs joint estimation and then produces SMPL parameters by fitting
SMPL to resultant joints. The second approach regresses SMPL parameters
directly from the input images through a convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based model. However, these approaches suffer from the lack of
information for resolving the ambiguity of joint rotation and shape
reconstruction and the difficulty of network learning. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage method. The proposed method
first estimates the coordinates of mesh vertices through a CNN-based model from
input images, and acquires SMPL parameters by fitting the SMPL model to the
estimated vertices. Estimated mesh vertices provide sufficient information for
determining joint rotation and shape, and are easier to learn than SMPL
parameters. According to experiments using Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets,
the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous works in terms of
joint rotation and shape estimation, and achieves competitive performance in
terms of joint location estimation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11251v1

an ad hoc agent to perform non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior
commonsense domain knowledge and incrementally-updated simple predictive models
of other agents' behaviour. We use the benchmark simulated multi-agent

  twisting",2022-08-24T15:15:44Z,Ma Luo,"Twistronic has recently attracted tremendous attention because the twisting
can engineer the bilayer graphene-like materials into varying types of strongly
correlated phases. In this paper, we study the twisting of bilayer graphene
(BLG) quantum dots (QDs) with hexagonal shape and zigzag edges. In the
untwisted BLG-QDs, the zigzag edges of graphene host spontaneous magnetism with
varying magnetic configurations. As a BLG-QD being adiabatically twisted, the
quantum state evolves as a function of the twisting angle. If the twisting
angle changes across certain critical value, the magnetic configuration of the
quantum state sharply changes. For the twisting process with increasing or
decreasing twisting angle, the number and value of the critical twisting angles
are different. Thus, the twisting process with the twisting angle increasing
and decreasing back and forth could enter a hysteresis loop. The twisting of
BLG QDs with adatom is also investigated. The tuning features of the magnetic
configuration of the twisted BLG-QDs could be applied for graphene-based
quantum memory devices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11603v1

strong ion gyroradius-scale source (inspired by electron cyclotron current
drive) to the Fokker-Planck equation, then perform a multi-scale analysis that
distinguishes the fast electrons driven by the source from the slow bulk

parallel streaming to be along the modified field lines. These terms have been
successfully implemented in a gyrokinetic code (while retaining the typical
Fourier representation), which enables flux tube studies of non-monotonic

Sustaining Fairness via Incremental Learning,2022-08-25T17:02:37Z,"Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Snigdha Chaturvedi","Machine learning systems are often deployed for making critical decisions

towards specific demographics. Prior work has focused on debiasing intermediate
representations to ensure fair decisions. However, these approaches fail to
remain fair with changes in the task or demographic distribution. To ensure
fairness in the wild, it is important for a system to adapt to such changes as
it accesses new data in an incremental fashion. In this work, we propose to
address this issue by introducing the problem of learning fair representations
in an incremental learning setting. To this end, we present Fairness-aware
Incremental Representation Learning (FaIRL), a representation learning system
that can sustain fairness while incrementally learning new tasks. FaIRL is able
to achieve fairness and learn new tasks by controlling the rate-distortion

performance with a fixed compared policy. We consider three foundational models
of online MDPs, including episodic loop-free Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP),
episodic SSP, and infinite-horizon MDPs. For these three models, we propose
novel online ensemble algorithms and establish their dynamic regret guarantees
respectively, in which the results for episodic (loop-free) SSP are provably
minimax optimal in terms of time horizon and certain non-stationarity measure.
Furthermore, when the online environments encountered by the learner are

Flexible Vertical Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Parties,2022-08-26T13:54:39Z,"Timothy Castiglia, Shiqiang Wang, Stacy Patterson","We propose Flexible Vertical Federated Learning (Flex-VFL), a distributed

a local dataset; the datasets have different features but share the same sample
ID space. The parties are heterogeneous in nature: the parties' operating
speeds, local model architectures, and optimizers may be different from one
another and, further, they may change over time. To train a global model in
such a system, Flex-VFL utilizes a form of parallel block coordinate descent,
where parties train a partition of the global model via stochastic coordinate
descent. We provide theoretical convergence analysis for Flex-VFL and show that
the convergence rate is constrained by the party speeds and local optimizer
parameters. We apply this analysis and extend our algorithm to adapt party
learning rates in response to changing speeds and local optimizer parameters.
Finally, we compare the convergence time of Flex-VFL against synchronous and
asynchronous VFL algorithms, as well as illustrate the effectiveness of our

copy of $P$. Matrix $M$ is semisaturating for $P$ if changing any $0$-entry to
$1$-entry of $M$ introduces a new copy of $P$, regardless of whether $M$
originally contains $P$ or not. The functions $ex(n;P)$ and $sat(n;P)$ are the

of the titles. Thus changes in lexical diversity are treated as indicators of
shifts, and possibly expansion, of research. Therefore, optimizing detection of

external conditions. However, under a protocol in which particles slowly change
size in a quasistatic oscillatory way the system is observed to creep down in a
synchronized way with the oscillation. We measure the creep advance per cycle
as a function of the slope angle and the degree of change in particle size. In
addition, we consider a situation in which the particle size oscillation
amplitude decreases with depth, as it may be argued to occur in the case of a

P2P overlay protocols can be adopted. Among these, the most representative

L}(x,\partial_x)=a_{ij}(x)\partial_i\partial_j+b_k(x)\partial_k$, where the
$a_{ij}$ have modulus of continuity $\omega(r)$ satisfying the square-Dini
condition and the $b_k$ are allowed mild singularities of order
$r^{-1}\omega(r)$. A singular integral is introduced that controls the
existence of the fundamental solution. We give examples that show the singular
drift $b_k\partial_k$ may act as a perturbation that does not dramatically
change the fundamental solution of ${\mathcal L}^o=a_{ij}\partial_i\partial_j$,

GPU Voronoi Diagrams for Random Moving Seeds,2022-08-31T21:09:54Z,"Rodrigo Stevenson, Cristóbal A. Navarro","The Voronoi Diagram is a geometrical structure that is widely used in
scientific or technological applications where proximity is a relevant aspect
to consider, and it also resembles natural phenomena such as cellular banks,
rock formations or bee hives, among others. Typically, computing the Voronoi
Diagram is done in a static context, that is, the location of the input seeds
is defined once and does not change. In this work we study the dynamic case
where seeds move, which leads to a dynamic Voronoi Diagram that changes over
time. In particular, we consider uniform random moving seeds, for which we
propose the \textit{dynamic Jump Flooding Algorithm} (dJFA), a variant of JFA
that uses less iterations than the standard JFA. An experimental evaluation
shows that dJFA achieves a speedup of up to $\sim 5.3 \times$ over JFA, while
maintaining a similarity of at least $88\%$ and close to $100\%$ in many cases.
These results contribute with a step towards the achievement of real-time
GPU-based computation of dynamic Voronoi diagrams for any particle simulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00117v1

cyclic drive, we show that dissipation transiently increases when first
surpassing the largest perturbation due to irreversible structural changes with
unique statistics. This is used to devise novel memory readout protocols based

A taxonomy of surprise definitions,2022-09-02T13:07:15Z,"Alireza Modirshanechi, Johanni Brea, Wulfram Gerstner","Surprising events trigger measurable brain activity and influence human
behavior by affecting learning, memory, and decision-making. Currently there
is, however, no consensus on the definition of surprise. Here we identify 18
mathematical definitions of surprise in a unifying framework. We first propose
a technical classification of these definitions into three groups based on
their dependence on an agent's belief, show how they relate to each other, and
prove under what conditions they are indistinguishable. Going beyond this
technical analysis, we propose a taxonomy of surprise definitions and classify
them into four conceptual categories based on the quantity they measure: (i)
'prediction surprise' measures a mismatch between a prediction and an
observation; (ii) 'change-point detection surprise' measures the probability of
a change in the environment; (iii) 'confidence-corrected surprise' explicitly
accounts for the effect of confidence; and (iv) 'information gain surprise'
measures the belief-update upon a new observation. The taxonomy poses the

Quickest Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks With Unlabeled Samples,2022-09-04T03:45:32Z,"Zhongchang Sun, Shaofeng Zou","The problem of quickest anomaly detection in networks with unlabeled samples
is studied. At some unknown time, an anomaly emerges in the network and changes
the data-generating distribution of some unknown sensor. The data vector
received by the fusion center at each time step undergoes some unknown and
arbitrary permutation of its entries (unlabeled samples). The goal of the
fusion center is to detect the anomaly with minimal detection delay subject to
false alarm constraints. With unlabeled samples, existing approaches that
combines local cumulative sum (CuSum) statistics cannot be used anymore.
Several major questions include whether detection is still possible without the
label information, if so, what is the fundamental limit and how to achieve
that. Two cases with static and dynamic anomaly are investigated, where the
sensor affected by the anomaly may or may not change with time. For the two
cases, practical algorithms based on the ideas of mixture likelihood ratio
and/or maximum likelihood estimate are constructed. Their average detection
delays and false alarm rates are theoretically characterized. Universal lower
bounds on the average detection delay for a given false alarm rate are also
derived, which further demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of the two

Do Unions Shape Political Ideologies at Work?,2022-09-06T16:45:51Z,"Johannes Matzat, Aiko Schmeißer","Labor unions influence economic outcomes not only through bargaining with
employers over work contracts but also via political activities that can
profoundly shape political systems. In unionized workplaces, they may mobilize

of unionization on workers' and managers' political campaign contributions in
the United States from 1980 to 2016. To do so, we link establishment-level
union election data with transaction-level campaign contributions to federal
and local candidates. Using a difference-in-differences design, validated
through regression discontinuity tests and a novel instrumental variable
approach, we find that unionization leads to a leftward shift of campaign
contributions. Unionization increases the support for Democrats relative to
Republicans not only among workers but also among managers, suggesting that it
fosters political alignment between the two groups. Our findings are not driven
by compositional changes of the workforce and are stronger in establishments

waves in a pentagonal domain. We find that by changing the shape and increasing
the dimensions of the domain, finite-size effects diminish and wave turbulence
is observed. In this regime, the temporal spectra decay with a slope compatible
with the Garrett-Munk spectra. Different regimes appear by changing the forcing
conditions, namely discrete wave turbulence, weak wave turbulence, and strongly

effective Lagrangian formalism, we calculate the production and absorption
cross sections of the $D^*$ and $D$ mesons in a hadronic medium. We compute the
time evolution of the abundances and the ratio $D^* /D$. They are approximately
constant in time. Also, assuming a Bjorken type cooling and using an empirical
relation between the freeze-out temperature and the central multiplicity
density, we estimate $D^* /D$ as a function of $ dN /d \eta (\eta =0)$, which
represents the system size. We find that, while the number of $D^*$'s and $D$'s
grows significantly with the system size, their ratio remains approximately
constant. This prediction can be compared with future experimental data. Our

nonparametric as the null hypothesis only assumes the time series concerned is
martingale difference without specifying any parametric forms of its

robust to the cross-series dependence of unknown magnitude. To the best of our

hole is magnetically charged, and therefore stable against decay by Hawking
radiation, the consequences can be quite different. Upon colliding with a

enough magnetic charge, we show that this collision can be detected as a sudden
change in the rotation period of the neutron star, a glitch or anti-glitch.We
argue that the magnetic primordial black hole, which then settles to the core
of the neutron star, does not necessarily devour the entire neutron star; the
system can instead reach a long-lived, quasi-stable equilibrium. Because the
black hole is microscopic compared to the neutron star, most stellar properties
remain unchanged compared to before the collision. However, the neutron star

Gromov-Wasserstein Autoencoders,2022-09-15T02:34:39Z,"Nao Nakagawa, Ren Togo, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama","Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based generative models offer flexible
representation learning by incorporating meta-priors, general premises
considered beneficial for downstream tasks. However, the incorporated
meta-priors often involve ad-hoc model deviations from the original likelihood
architecture, causing undesirable changes in their training. In this paper, we
propose a novel representation learning method, Gromov-Wasserstein Autoencoders
(GWAE), which directly matches the latent and data distributions using the
variational autoencoding scheme. Instead of likelihood-based objectives, GWAE
models minimize the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric between the trainable prior
and given data distributions. The GW metric measures the distance
structure-oriented discrepancy between distributions even with different
dimensionalities, which provides a direct measure between the latent and data
spaces. By restricting the prior family, we can introduce meta-priors into the
latent space without changing their objective. The empirical comparisons with
VAE-based models show that GWAE models work in two prominent meta-priors,
disentanglement and clustering, with their GW objective unchanged.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07007v2

resolution sensor with non-regular sampling. Therefore, post-processing is
necessary. In terms of video data, not only the spatial neighborhood can be
used to assist the reconstruction, but also the temporal neighborhood. A
popular and well performing algorithm for this kind of problem is the
three-dimensional frequency selective extrapolation (3D-FSE) for which a motion
adapted version is introduced in this paper. This proposed extension solves the
problem of changing content within the area considered by the 3D-FSE, which is
caused by motion within the sequence. Because of this motion, it may happen
that regions are emphasized during the reconstruction that are not present in
the original signal within the considered area. By that, false content is
introduced into the extrapolated sequence, which affects the resulting image

that we can reasonably predict the future path and expected change in torso
sway by conditioning the expected path and torso sway on the past trajectory,

operates on partial-view point clouds and can reason about multiple objects
dynamically interacting during the manipulation. By learning a dynamics model

planning to reach target goal relations. We show our model trained purely in

Bayesian Modeling of TVP-VARs Using Regression Trees,2022-09-24T09:40:41Z,"Niko Hauzenberger, Florian Huber, Gary Koop, James Mitchell","In light of widespread evidence of parameter instability in macroeconomic
models, many time-varying parameter (TVP) models have been proposed. This paper
proposes a nonparametric TVP-VAR model using Bayesian additive regression trees
(BART) that models the TVPs as an unknown function of effect modifiers. The
novelty of this model arises from the fact that the law of motion driving the
parameters is treated nonparametrically. This leads to great flexibility in the
nature and extent of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and in the
conditional variance. Parsimony is achieved through adopting nonparametric
factor structures and use of shrinkage priors. In an application to US
macroeconomic data, we illustrate the use of our model in tracking both the
evolving nature of the Phillips curve and how the effects of business cycle
shocks on inflation measures vary nonlinearly with changes in the effect
modifiers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11970v3

neurons based on coupled degenerate parametric oscillators can show various
chimera states, in which, depending on their local synchronization and
desynchronization, different kinds of spiking dynamics can develop in a
self-organized manner. Even when only a static interaction is implemented,
through synchronized inputs from connected neurons, the spiking mode of
photonic neurons can be spontaneously and adaptively changed between the
Class-I and Class-II modes classified by A. L. Hodgkin. This spontaneous
spiking-mode shift induces a significant change in the spiking frequency
despite the all neurons having the same natural spiking frequency, which
encourages the generation of chimera states. Controllability and self-organized
flexibility of the spiking modes in the present system allow us to create an
experimental platform to explore the nature of chimera states in neuromorphic
spiking neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12087v1
"Electromagnetic fields between moving mirrors: Singular waveforms inside
  Doppler cavities",2022-09-24T22:49:20Z,"Theodoros T. Koutserimpas, Constantinos Valagiannopoulos","Phenomena of wave propagation in dynamically varying structures have
reemerged as the temporal variations of the medium's properties can extend the
possibilities for electromagnetic wave manipulation. While the dynamical change
of the electromagnetic medium's properties is a difficult task, the movement of
scatterers is not. In this paper, we analyze the electromagnetic fields trapped
inside two smoothly moving mirrors. We employ the method of characteristics and
take into account the relativistic phenomena to show that the temporally and
spatially local Doppler effects can filter and amplify the electromagnetic
signal, tailoring the $k-$ and $\omega-$content of the transients. It is shown
using the Doppler factor and the change of the distance between neighbor
characteristics that the dynamical movement of the boundaries can lead to
condensated characteristics resulting in field amplification or dilution of the
characteristics resulting in the attenuation of the signal. In the case of
periodically moving mirrors the field distribution is shown that asymptotically
leads to exponentially growing delta-like wave packets at discrete points of
space with a limiting number of peaks due to the fact that the velocity of the
mechanical vibrations can not exceed that of light. The theoretical analysis is
also verified by FDTD simulations and is connected with the theory of mode
locking.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12100v1

resulting in the performance degradation for most traditional CP methods. To
further improve the prediction accuracy, in this paper, we focus on the ISAC in
vehicle networks and propose a convolutional long-short term (CLSTM) recurrent

predictive beamforming. In the developed CLRNet, both the convolutional neural
network (CNN) module and the LSTM module are adopted to exploit the spatial
features and the temporal dependency from the estimated historical angles of
vehicles to facilitate the angle prediction. Finally, numerical results

Observation of ripples under different angles,2022-09-28T11:57:30Z,"A. Lopez-Cazalilla, F. Djurabekova, K. Nordlund","The off-normal ion irradiation of semiconductor materials is seen to induce
nanopatterning effects. Different theories are proposed to explain the
mechanisms that drive self-reorganization of amorphisable surfaces. One of the
prominent hypothesis associates formation of nanopatterning with the changes of
sputtering characteristics caused by changes in surface morphology. At
ultra-low energy, when sputtering is negligible, the Si surface has still been
seen to re-organize forming surface ripples with the wave vector either aligned
with the ion beam direction or perpendicular to it.In this work, we investigate
the formation of ripples using molecular dynamics in all the three regimes of
ripple formation: low angles where no ripples form, intermediate regime where
the ripple wave vectors are parallel to the beam, and high angles where they
are perpendicular to it. We obtain atom-level insight on how the ion-beam
driven atomic dynamics at the surface contributes to organization, or lack of
it, in all the different regimes. Results of our simulations agree well with
experimental observations in the same range of ultra-low energy of ion
irradiation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14020v2
Generalized Kernel Regularized Least Squares,2022-09-28T18:36:56Z,"Qing Chang, Max Goplerud","Kernel Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) is a popular method for flexibly
estimating models that may have complex relationships between variables.
However, its usefulness to many researchers is limited for two reasons. First,
existing approaches are inflexible and do not allow KRLS to be combined with
theoretically-motivated extensions such as random effects, unregularized fixed
effects, or non-Gaussian outcomes. Second, estimation is extremely
computationally intensive for even modestly sized datasets. Our paper addresses
both concerns by introducing generalized KRLS (gKRLS). We note that KRLS can be
re-formulated as a hierarchical model thereby allowing easy inference and
modular model construction where KRLS can be used alongside random effects,
splines, and unregularized fixed effects. Computationally, we also implement
random sketching to dramatically accelerate estimation while incurring a
limited penalty in estimation quality. We demonstrate that gKRLS can be fit on
datasets with tens of thousands of observations in under one minute. Further,
state-of-the-art techniques that require fitting the model over a dozen times

struggle with learning new things on the fly. We present a novel rehearsal-free
approach, where a deep neural network is continually learning new unseen object
categories without saving any data of prior sequences. Our approach is called
RECALL, as the network recalls categories by calculating logits for old
categories before training new ones. These are then used during training to
avoid changing the old categories. For each new sequence, a new head is added
to accommodate the new categories. To mitigate forgetting, we present a
regularization strategy where we replace the classification with a regression.
Moreover, for the known categories, we propose a Mahalanobis loss that includes
the variances to account for the changing densities between known and unknown
categories. Finally, we present a novel dataset for continual learning,
especially suited for object recognition on a mobile robot (HOWS-CL-25),

more accurate knowledge about the future available bandwidth. Because with such
knowledge, one is able to know what sizes should he encode the frames to be in

However, limitation remains as most current bandwidth prediction methods are
predicting a value, or a point estimate, of future bandwidth. Because in many
practical scenarios, it is desirable to control the performance to some
targets, e.g., video delivery rate over a given target percentage, which cannot
be easily achieved via most current methods.
  In this work, we propose the use of probability distribution to model future

measurements and then derive a probability model for use in the application.

the limit of zero effective temperature of the Fermi function, we find that the
copying probabilities are discontinuous functions of the system's parameters

final state for any system size, in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo

  Reading Comprehension",2022-10-06T00:53:24Z,"Suzhe He, Shumin Shi, Chenghao Wu","More tasks in Machine Reading Comprehension(MRC) require, in addition to
answer prediction, the extraction of evidence sentences that support the
answer. However, the annotation of supporting evidence sentences is usually
time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, to address this issue and
considering that most of the existing extraction methods are semi-supervised,
we propose an unsupervised evidence extraction method (U3E). U3E takes the
changes after sentence-level feature erasure in the document as input,
simulating the decline in problem-solving ability caused by human memory
decline. In order to make selections on the basis of fully understanding the
semantics of the original text, we also propose metrics to quickly select the
optimal memory model for this input changes. To compare U3E with typical
evidence extraction methods and investigate its effectiveness in evidence
extraction, we conduct experiments on different datasets. Experimental results
show that U3E is simple but effective, not only extracting evidence more
accurately, but also significantly improving model performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02621v3

non-radial adiabatic pulsations. A topological analysis then connects the
changes of sign of the acoustic-buoyant frequency to the existence of Lamb-like
waves within the star. These topological modes cross the frequency gap and
behave as gravity modes at low harmonic degree $\ell$ and as pressure modes at
high $\ell$. $S$ is found to change sign at least once in the bulk of most

a hierarchical federated learning model, delay in communication and computation
of model parameters has a great impact on achieving a predefined global model

BINOL, but increased control of the diasteriomeric excess (de) is necessary for
its broad utility. Here we develop a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED)
generalization of time-dependent density functional theory and demonstrate
computationally that strong light-matter coupling can alter the de of chiral
group-directed photoisomerization of BINOL. The relative orientation of the
cavity mode polarization and the molecules in the cavity dictates the nature of
the cavity interactions, which either enhance the de of the (R)-BINOL
diasteriomer (from 17% to $\approx$ 40%) or invert the favorability to the

input-output pairs meet the requirements and then modifies the model's outputs.
Such a module, which we call a {\em concurrent verifier} (CV), can give a
certification, although how the generalizability of the machine learning model
changes using a CV is unclear. This paper gives a generalization analysis of
learning with a CV. We analyze how the learnability of a machine learning model

topology, can handle such a challenge. However, existing TDA has been somewhat
limited to capturing the static summary of dynamically changing brain networks.
We propose a novel dynamic-TDA framework that builds persistent homology over a
time series of brain networks. We construct a Wasserstein distance based
inference procedure to discriminate between time series of networks. The method
is applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images of human
brain. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamic-TDA approach can distinctly
discriminate between the topological patterns of male and female brain
networks. MATLAB code for implementing this method is available at

Random Multiple Operator Integrals,2022-10-17T19:44:54Z,Shih-Yu Chang,"The introduction of Schur multipliers into the context of Double Operator
Integrals (DOIs) was proposed by V. V. Peller in 1985. This work extends
theorem on Schur multipliers from measurable functions to their closure space
and generalizes the definition of DOIs to Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs)
for integrand functions as Schur multipliersconstructible by taking the limit
of projective tensor product and by taking the limit of integral projective
tensor product. According to such closure space construction for integrand
functions, we demonstrate that any function defined on a compact set of a
Euclidean space can be expressed by taking the limit of the projective tensor
product of linear functions. We also generalize previous works about random
DOIs with respect to finite dimensional operators, tensors, to MOIs with
respect to random operators, which are defined from spectral decomposition
perspectives. Based on random MOIs definitions and their properties, we derive
several tail bounds for norms of higher random operator derivatives, higher
random operator difference and Taylor remainder of random operator-valued
functions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09392v1

These rule-based approaches are motivated by chemical reaction rules which are
traditionally solved numerically with the standard Gillespie algorithm proposed
in the context of molecular dynamics. When applying reaction system type of
approaches to epidemiology, generalisations of the Gillespie algorithm are
required due to the time-dependency of the problems. In this article, we
present different generalisations of the standard Gillespie algorithm which
address discrete subtypes (e.g., incorporating the age structure of the
population), time-discrete updates (e.g., incorporating daily imposed change of
rates for lockdowns) and deterministic delays (e.g., given waiting time until a
specific change in types such as release from isolation occurs). These

things in society has been widely studied in sociology and across the social
sciences, with investigations sufficiently diverse and dispersed to make them
unnavigable. This complexity results from innovation's importance for society,
but also the fundamental paradox underlying innovation science: When innovation
becomes predictable, it ceases to be an engine of novelty and change. Here we
review innovation studies and show that innovations emerge from contexts of
discord and disorder, breaches in the structure of prior success, through a
process we term destructive creation. This often leads to a complementary
process of creative destruction whereby local structures protect and channel
the diffusion of successful innovations, rendering alternatives obsolete. We
find that social scientists naturally focus far more on how social and cultural
contexts influence material innovations than the converse. We highlight
computational tools that open new possibilities for the analysis of novel
content and context in interaction, and show how this brings us empirically
toward the broader range of possibilities that complex systems and science

breaking elongated current sheets into chains of small magnetic flux ropes (or

the plasmoids. As a consequence, the turbulent energy spectra steepen and

between tasks: machine translation (MT) exhibits length bias, while tasks like
story generation exhibit excessive repetition. Recent work has attributed the
difference to task constrainedness, but evidence for this claim has always
involved many confounding variables. To study this question directly, we
introduce a new experimental framework that allows us to smoothly vary task
constrainedness, from MT at one end to fully open-ended generation at the
other, while keeping all other aspects fixed. We find that: (1) repetition
decreases smoothly with constrainedness, explaining the difference in
repetition across tasks; (2) length bias surprisingly also decreases with
constrainedness, suggesting some other cause for the difference in length bias;
(3) across the board, these problems affect the mode, not the whole

entropy of the distribution, since another method of changing the entropy,
label smoothing, does not produce the same effect.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10817v1

Only tau participates in the tree-level Standard Model ( SM ) Yukawa

radiative generation and(or) the heavy-mediator-suppressed Yukawa coupling to
the SM Higgs. Not only can the measured anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the

  Without additional discrete symmetries introduced, charged lepton flavor
violation is highly suppressed by the $U(1)_\ell$ symmetry. Corresponding to
two equally viable $U(1)_\ell$ charge assignments, this model predicts either
$A_{FB}^\mu <A_{FB}^\tau <A_{FB}^e$ or $A_{FB}^\mu >A_{FB}^\tau >A_{FB}^e$,
which can be tested at the $e^+e^-$ machines before discovering the $U(1)_\ell$

Adversarial training and certified robust training have shown some
effectiveness in improving the robustness of machine learnt models to fickle

surpass this shortcut and fairly evaluate AED methods, we propose to test AED

quantify linguistic influence in timestamped document collections. There are
two main steps: first, identify lexical and semantic changes using contextual
embeddings and word frequencies; second, aggregate information about these
changes into per-document influence scores by estimating a high-dimensional
Hawkes process with a low-rank parameter matrix. We show that this measure of
linguistic influence is predictive of $\textit{future}$ citations: the estimate
of linguistic influence from the two years after a paper's publication is
correlated with and predictive of its citation count in the following three
years. This is demonstrated using an online evaluation with incremental
temporal training/test splits, in comparison with a strong baseline that
includes predictors for initial citation counts, topics, and lexical features.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13628v1

"Quasistatic contact-rich manipulation via linear complementarity
  quadratic programming",2022-10-25T10:55:40Z,"Sotaro Katayama, Tatsunori Taniai, Kazutoshi Tanaka","Contact-rich manipulation is challenging due to dynamically-changing physical
constraints by the contact mode changes undergone during manipulation. This
paper proposes a versatile local planning and control framework for
contact-rich manipulation that determines the continuous control action under
variable contact modes online. We model the physical characteristics of
contact-rich manipulation by quasistatic dynamics and complementarity
constraints. We then propose a linear complementarity quadratic program (LCQP)
to efficiently determine the control action that implicitly includes the
decisions on the contact modes under these constraints. In the LCQP, we relax
the complementarity constraints to alleviate ill-conditioned problems that are
typically caused by measure noises or model miss-matches. We conduct dynamical
simulations on a 3D physical simulator and demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve various contact-rich manipulation tasks by determining the control
action including the contact modes in real-time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13908v1

during pre-training? (3) How does the PLM's task knowledge change along the

Graph Filter Transfer via Probability Density Ratio Weighting,2022-10-26T11:23:06Z,Koki Yamada,"The problem of recovering graph signals is one of the main topics in graph

improve the feed-forward Transformer (FFT) block by adding multiple residual
convolutional blocks in parallel with the self-attention block to balance the
local and global features. The multi-band discriminator contains three
sub-discriminators responsible for low-, middle-, and high-frequency parts of

damage to property and the ecosystem, as well as the loss of life. Forecasting
wildfire front propagation is essential in order to support fire fighting
efforts and plan evacuations. The level set method has been widely used to
analyze the change in surfaces, shapes, and boundaries. In particular, a signed
distance function used in level set methods can readily be interpreted to
represent complicated boundaries and their changes in time. While there is
substantial literature on the level set method in wildfire applications, these
implementations have relied on a heavily-parameterized formula for the rate of
spread. These implementations have not typically considered uncertainty
quantification or incorporated data-driven learning. Here, we present a
Bayesian spatio-temporal dynamic model based on level sets, which can be
utilized for forecasting the boundary of interest in the presence of uncertain

nonlinearity. In general, we use an Emden--Fowler change of variables to
translate our problem to a cylinder. In the lower critical regime, this is not

difficulty is that the cylindrical PDE in this coordinate system is
nonautonomous. Nonetheless, we define an associated nonautonomous Pohozaev

Te Test: A New Non-asymptotic T-test for Behrens-Fisher Problems,2022-10-29T02:56:22Z,"Chang Wang, Jinzhu Jia","The Behrens-Fisher Problem is a classical statistical problem. It is to test
the equality of the means of two normal populations using two independent

Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis with $\varepsilon$--perturbation,2022-10-29T12:22:17Z,"Zheyang Xiong, Fangshuo Liao, Anastasios Kyrillidis","The strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) claims the existence of a
subnetwork in a sufficiently large, randomly initialized neural network that
approximates some target neural network without the need of training. We extend
the theoretical guarantee of the strong LTH literature to a scenario more
similar to the original LTH, by generalizing the weight change in the
pre-training step to some perturbation around initialization. In particular, we
focus on the following open questions: By allowing an $\varepsilon$-scale
perturbation on the random initial weights, can we reduce the
over-parameterization requirement for the candidate network in the strong LTH?
Furthermore, does the weight change by SGD coincide with a good set of such
perturbation?
  We answer the first question by first extending the theoretical result on
subset sum to allow perturbation on the candidates. Applying this result to the
neural network setting, we show that such $\varepsilon$-perturbation reduces
the over-parameterization requirement of the strong LTH. To answer the second

constrained multibody systems that can serve as a basis for analysis,
simulation, and control. The main advantage of the formulation of the dynamic
is that it does not require the constraint equations to be linearly
independent. Thus, a simulation may proceed even in the presence of redundant
constraints or singular configurations and a controller does not need to change
its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of
degrees of freedom. A motion control scheme is proposed based on a projected
inverse-dynamics scheme which proves to be stable and minimizes the weighted
Euclidean norm of the actuation force. The projection-based control scheme is
further developed for constrained systems, e.g. parallel manipulators, which
have some joints with no actuators (passive joints). This is complemented by
the development of constraint force control. A condition on the inertia matrix
resulting in a decoupled mechanical system is analytically derived which
simplifies the implementation of the force control.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17053v1

A Converse for Fault-tolerant Quantum Computation,2022-11-01T18:43:14Z,"Uthirakalyani G, Anuj K. Nayak, Avhishek Chatterjee","As techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computation keep improving, it is
natural to ask: what is the fundamental lower bound on redundancy? In this
paper, we obtain a lower bound on the redundancy required for
$\epsilon$-accurate implementation of a large class of operations that includes
unitary operators. For the practically relevant case of sub-exponential depth
and sub-linear gate size, our bound on redundancy is tighter than the known
lower bounds. We obtain this bound by connecting fault-tolerant computation
with a set of finite blocklength quantum communication problems whose accuracy
requirements satisfy a joint constraint. The lower bound on redundancy obtained
here leads to a strictly smaller upper bound on the noise threshold for
non-degradable noise. Our bound directly extends to the case where noise at the
outputs of a gate are non-i.i.d. but noise across gates are i.i.d.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00697v4
State-dependent Asset Allocation Using Neural Networks,2022-11-02T04:41:30Z,"Reza Bradrania, Davood Pirayesh Neghab","Changes in market conditions present challenges for investors as they cause
performance to deviate from the ranges predicted by long-term averages of means
and covariances. The aim of conditional asset allocation strategies is to
overcome this issue by adjusting portfolio allocations to hedge changes in the
investment opportunity set. This paper proposes a new approach to conditional
asset allocation that is based on machine learning; it analyzes historical
market states and asset returns and identifies the optimal portfolio choice in
a new period when new observations become available. In this approach, we
directly relate state variables to portfolio weights, rather than firstly
modeling the return distribution and subsequently estimating the portfolio
choice. The method captures nonlinearity among the state (predicting) variables
and portfolio weights without assuming any particular distribution of returns
and other data, without fitting a model with a fixed number of predicting
variables to data and without estimating any parameters. The empirical results
for a portfolio of stock and bond indices show the proposed approach generates
a more efficient outcome compared to traditional methods and is robust in using
different objective functions across different sample periods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00871v1

Channeling: a new class of dissolution in complex porous media,2022-11-07T08:21:13Z,"Hannah P. Menke, Julien Maes, Sebastian Geiger","The current conceptual model of mineral dissolution in porous media is
comprised of three dissolution patterns (wormhole, compact, and uniform) - or
regimes - that develop depending on the relative dominance of flow, diffusion,
and reaction rate. Here, we examine the evolution of pore structure during acid
injection using numerical simulations on two porous media structures of
increasing complexity. We examine the boundaries between regimes and
characterise the existence of a fourth regime called channeling, where already
existing fast flow pathways are preferentially widened by dissolution.
Channeling occurs in cases where the distribution in pore throat size results
in orders of magnitude differences in flow rate for different flow pathways.
This focusing of dissolution along only dominant flow paths induces an
immediate, large change in permeability with a comparatively small change in
porosity, resulting in a porosity-permeability relationship unlike any that has
been previously seen. This work demonstrates that our current conceptual model
of dissolution regimes must be modified to include channeling for accurate

features. The solutions reached using these meshes depend on the quality of the
elements making up the mesh. The problem is that these individual elements can
take on a shape which prevents accurate computations. Such elements are
considered to be invalid. To allow users to get accurate results, the shape of
these elements must therefore be changed to be considered valid. In this work,
we combine the results of two papers to scan a mesh, identify possible invalid
elements and then change the shape of these elements to make them valid. With
this combination, we end up with a working algorithm. But there is room for

Variational Quantum Kernels with Task-Specific Quantum Metric Learning,2022-11-08T18:36:25Z,Daniel T. Chang,"Quantum kernel methods, i.e., kernel methods with quantum kernels, offer

Kernel methods rely on the notion of similarity between points in a higher

of similarity assumes that points close in the feature space should be close in
the machine learning task space. In this paper, we discuss the use of
variational quantum kernels with task-specific quantum metric learning to
generate optimal quantum embeddings (a.k.a. quantum feature encodings) that are

embeddings, implicitly supporting feature selection, are valuable not only to
quantum kernel methods in improving the latter's performance, but they can also
be valuable to non-kernel QML methods based on parameterized quantum circuits

the spatial domain, we derive a likelihood ratio test to preserve a model of a
decompressed JPEG image. The proposed method then bounds the power of this test
by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the cover and stego
distributions. We experimentally demonstrate in two popular datasets that it
achieves state-of-the-art performance against deep learning detectors.
Moreover, by considering a different pixel variance estimator for images
compressed with Quality Factor 100, even greater improvements are obtained.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05530v1
"Vis2Mus: Exploring Multimodal Representation Mapping for Controllable
  Music Generation",2022-11-10T13:01:26Z,"Runbang Zhang, Yixiao Zhang, Kai Shao, Ying Shan, Gus Xia","In this study, we explore the representation mapping from the domain of
visual arts to the domain of music, with which we can use visual arts as an
effective handle to control music generation. Unlike most studies in multimodal
representation learning that are purely data-driven, we adopt an
analysis-by-synthesis approach that combines deep music representation learning
with user studies. Such an approach enables us to discover
\textit{interpretable} representation mapping without a huge amount of paired
data. In particular, we discover that visual-to-music mapping has a nice
property similar to equivariant. In other words, we can use various image
transformations, say, changing brightness, changing contrast, style transfer,
to control the corresponding transformations in the music domain. In addition,
we released the Vis2Mus system as a controllable interface for symbolic music
generation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05543v1
Linear Discriminant Analysis with the Randomized Kaczmarz Method,2022-11-10T18:29:36Z,"Jocelyn T. Chi, Deanna Needell","We present a randomized Kaczmarz method for linear discriminant analysis
(rkLDA), an iterative randomized approach to binary-class Gaussian model linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) for very large data. We harness a least squares
formulation and mobilize the stochastic gradient descent framework to obtain a
randomized classifier with performance that can achieve comparable accuracy to
that of full data LDA. We present analysis for the expected change in the LDA
discriminant function if one employs the randomized Kaczmarz solution in lieu
of the full data least squares solution that accounts for both the Gaussian
modeling assumptions on the data and algorithmic randomness. Our analysis shows
how the expected change depends on quantities inherent in the data such as the
scaled condition number and Frobenius norm of the input data, how well the
linear model fits the data, and choices from the randomized algorithm. Our
experiments demonstrate that rkLDA can offer a viable alternative to full data
LDA on a range of step-sizes and numbers of iterations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05749v2
On anomalies and gauging of U(1) non-invertible symmetries in 4d QED,2022-11-10T19:00:08Z,Avner Karasik,"In this work we propose a way to promote the anomalous axial U(1)
transformations to exact non-invertible U(1) symmetries. We discuss the
procedure of coupling the non-invertible symmetry to a (dynamical or
background) gauge field. We show that as part of the gauging procedure, certain
constraints are imposed to make the gauging consistent. The constraints emerge
naturally from the form of the non-invertible U(1) conserved current. In the
case of dynamical gauging, this results in new type of gauge theories we call
non-invertible gauge theories: These are gauge theories with additional
constraints that cancel the would-be gauge anomalies. By coupling to background
gauge fields, we can discuss 't-Hooft anomalies of non-invertible symmetries.
We show in an example that the matching conditions hold but they are realized
in an unconventional way. Turning on non-trivial background for the
non-invertible gauge field changes the vacuum even when the symmetry is not
broken and the background is very weak. The anomalies are then matched by the
appearance of solitons in the new vacuum.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05802v3
"Switching Attention in Time-Varying Environments via Bayesian Inference
  of Abstractions",2022-11-10T20:36:02Z,"Meghan Booker, Anirudha Majumdar","Motivated by the goal of endowing robots with a means for focusing attention
in order to operate reliably in complex, uncertain, and time-varying
environments, we consider how a robot can (i) determine which portions of its
environment to pay attention to at any given point in time, (ii) infer changes
in context (e.g., task or environment dynamics), and (iii) switch its attention
accordingly. In this work, we tackle these questions by modeling context
switches in a time-varying Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We utilize
the theory of bisimulation-based state abstractions in order to synthesize
mechanisms for paying attention to context-relevant information. We then
present an algorithm based on Bayesian inference for detecting changes in the
robot's context (task or environment dynamics) as it operates online, and use
this to trigger switches between different abstraction-based attention
mechanisms. Our approach is demonstrated on two examples: (i) an illustrative
discrete-state tracking problem, and (ii) a continuous-state tracking problem
implemented on a quadrupedal hardware platform. These examples demonstrate the
ability of our approach to detect context switches online and robustly ignore
task-irrelevant distractors by paying attention to context-relevant
information.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05865v1

boosts the model's performance in standard VCR evaluation. Lastly, our in-depth

are well-applicable. For example, we consider the cases of empirical quantiles,
empirical expectiles, some $\psi$-estimators that are important in robust

we introduce Bajraktarevi\'c-type (in particular, quasi-arithmetic-type)

Tolerances in Flux Compression Generator Design: Theory,2022-11-11T09:17:22Z,"S. Anishchenko, P. Bogdanovich, A. Gurinovich","A flux compression generator (FCG) is a device generating a high-power
electro-magnetic pulse by compressing magnetic flux with the help of explosion.
The physical properties of components and materials used for FCG manufacturing
and available on the market (wires, explosives, liners (armatures), etc.) might
differ from those originally used for FCG design. As a result, the output
parameters of the manufactured generator (e.g. maximum output power) could
deviate from the pre-calculated values. Simple formulas are derived to enable
evaluation of change in output power delivered to a purely inductive load from
a helical flux compression generator in case when the wire insulation thickness
or the detonation velocity of explosive or load inductance $L_l$ are changed.
The obtained formulas establish acceptable tolerances for FCG components
produced by a third-party manufacturer. Design requirement is proposed to
ensure minimal dependence of the output power delivered to the purely inductive
load when its inductance is varied a bit. The proposed approach implies
approximate equality of load inductance and the residual FCG inductance at the

"Token Transformer: Can class token help window-based transformer build
  better long-range interactions?",2022-11-11T09:36:47Z,"Jiawei Mao, Yuanqi Chang, Xuesong Yin","Compared with the vanilla transformer, the window-based transformer offers a
better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Although the window-based
transformer has made great progress, its long-range modeling capabilities are
limited due to the size of the local window and the window connection scheme.
To address this problem, we propose a novel Token Transformer (TT). The core
mechanism of TT is the addition of a Class (CLS) token for summarizing window
information in each local window. We refer to this type of token interaction as
CLS Attention. These CLS tokens will interact spatially with the tokens in each
window to enable long-range modeling. In order to preserve the hierarchical
design of the window-based transformer, we designed Feature Inheritance Module
(FIM) in each phase of TT to deliver the local window information from the
previous phase to the CLS token in the next phase. In addition, we have
designed a Spatial-Channel Feedforward Network (SCFFN) in TT, which can mix CLS
tokens and embedded tokens on the spatial domain and channel domain without
additional parameters. Extensive experiments have shown that our TT achieves
competitive results with low parameters in image classification and downstream
tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06083v2

  Environments with Obstacles",2022-11-11T17:49:04Z,"Martin Zimmermann, Minh Nhat Vu, Florian Beck, Anh Nguyen, Andreas Kugi","This paper presents a two-step algorithm for online trajectory planning in
indoor environments with unknown obstacles. In the first step, sampling-based
path planning techniques such as the optimal Rapidly exploring Random Tree
(RRT*) algorithm and the Line-of-Sight (LOS) algorithm are employed to generate
a collision-free path consisting of multiple waypoints. Then, in the second
step, constrained quadratic programming is utilized to compute a smooth
trajectory that passes through all computed waypoints. The main contribution of
this work is the development of a flexible trajectory planning framework that
can detect changes in the environment, such as new obstacles, and compute
alternative trajectories in real time. The proposed algorithm actively
considers all changes in the environment and performs the replanning process
only on waypoints that are occupied by new obstacles. This helps to reduce the
computation time and realize the proposed approach in real time. The
feasibility of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the Intel Aero

The Implicit Delta Method,2022-11-11T19:34:17Z,"Nathan Kallus, James McInerney","Epistemic uncertainty quantification is a crucial part of drawing credible
conclusions from predictive models, whether concerned about the prediction at a
given point or any downstream evaluation that uses the model as input. When the
predictive model is simple and its evaluation differentiable, this task is
solved by the delta method, where we propagate the asymptotically-normal
uncertainty in the predictive model through the evaluation to compute standard
errors and Wald confidence intervals. However, this becomes difficult when the
model and/or evaluation becomes more complex. Remedies include the bootstrap,
but it can be computationally infeasible when training the model even once is
costly. In this paper, we propose an alternative, the implicit delta method,
which works by infinitesimally regularizing the training loss of the predictive
model to automatically assess downstream uncertainty. We show that the change
in the evaluation due to regularization is consistent for the asymptotic
variance of the evaluation estimator, even when the infinitesimal change is
approximated by a finite difference. This provides both a reliable
quantification of uncertainty in terms of standard errors as well as permits
the construction of calibrated confidence intervals. We discuss connections to
other approaches to uncertainty quantification, both Bayesian and frequentist,

The Effect of Externally Applied 3D Fields on NSTX Edge Turbulence,2022-11-12T06:58:39Z,"Michael O. Hanson, Dmitri M. Orlov, Stewart Zweben, Andreas Wingen","We report on a study of the structure of edge turbulence in NSTX H-mode
discharges with applied n=1 and n=3 non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations.
The edge turbulence is diagnosed in NSTX using the gas puff imaging (GPI)
system to understand how these 3D fields affect edge transport. The presented
database study uses a selection of discharges that have a change in the RWM
coil current during the GPI gas puff. We compare the turbulence before and
after this change in the applied non-axisymmetric fields, and compares the
turbulence between the two states. Our findings show that these 3D fields do
not have a strong, statistically significant impact on the average poloidal
size, autocorrelation time, or relative fluctuation levels of the turbulence.
In addition, we find that the displacement of the radial location of the GPI
signal peak intensity is correlated with the shift in the perturbed separatrix
location as predicted by the 3D vacuum magnetic field code MAFOT. We find that
in general the non-axisymmetric fields from the RWM coils locally displace the
edge flux surface as expected even when the self-consistent plasma response is
not included, and that the model reproduces the localized shift observed by

Chaotic saddles and interior crises in a dissipative nontwist system,2022-11-13T15:03:44Z,"Rodrigo Simile Baroni, Ricardo Egydio de Carvalho, Iberê Luiz Caldas, Ricardo Luiz Viana, Philip J Morrison","We consider a dissipative version of the standard nontwist map. Nontwist
systems present a robust transport barrier, called the shearless curve, that
becomes the shearless attractor when dissipation is introduced. This attractor
can be regular or chaotic depending on the control parameters. Chaotic
attractors can undergo sudden and qualitative changes as a parameter is varied.
These changes are called crises, and at an interior crisis the attractor
suddenly expands. Chaotic saddles are nonattracting chaotic sets that play a
fundamental role in the dynamics of nonlinear systems, they are responsible for
chaotic transients, fractal basin boundaries, chaotic scattering and they
mediate interior crises. In this work we discuss the creation of chaotic
saddles in a dissipative nontwist system and the interior crises they generate.
We show how the presence of two saddles increase the transient times and

Surface Deformation During an Action Potential in Pearled Cells,2022-11-14T08:36:46Z,"Matan Mussel, Christian Fillafer, Gal Ben-Porath, Matthias F. Schneider","Electric pulses in biological cells (action potentials) have been reported to
be accompanied by a propagating cell-surface deformation with a nano-scale
amplitude. Typically, this cell surface is covered by external layers of
polymer material (extracellular matrix, cell wall material etc.). It was
recently demonstrated in excitable plant cells (Chara Braunii) that the rigid
external layer (cell wall) hinders the underlying deformation. When the cell
membrane was separated from the cell wall by osmosis, a mechanical deformation,
in the micrometer range, was observed upon excitation of the cell. The
underlying mechanism of this mechanical pulse has up to date remained elusive.
Herein we report that Chara cells can undergo a pearling instability, and when
the pearled fragments were excited even larger and more regular cell shape
changes were observed (about 10 to 100 um in amplitude). These transient
cellular deformations were captured by a curvature model that is based on three
parameters: surface tension, bending rigidity and pressure difference across
the surface. In this paper these parameters are extracted by curve-fitting to
the experimental cellular shapes at rest and during excitation. This is a
necessary step to identify the mechanical parameters that change during an
action potential.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07193v1
Controllable GAN Synthesis Using Non-Rigid Structure-from-Motion,2022-11-14T08:37:55Z,"René Haas, Stella Graßhof, Sami S. Brandt","In this paper, we present an approach for combining non-rigid
structure-from-motion (NRSfM) with deep generative models,and propose an
efficient framework for discovering trajectories in the latent space of 2D GANs
corresponding to changes in 3D geometry. Our approach uses recent advances in
NRSfM and enables editing of the camera and non-rigid shape information
associated with the latent codes without needing to retrain the generator. This
formulation provides an implicit dense 3D reconstruction as it enables the
image synthesis of novel shapes from arbitrary view angles and non-rigid
structure. The method is built upon a sparse backbone, where a neural regressor
is first trained to regress parameters describing the cameras and sparse
non-rigid structure directly from the latent codes. The latent trajectories
associated with changes in the camera and structure parameters are then
identified by estimating the local inverse of the regressor in the neighborhood
of a given latent code. The experiments show that our approach provides a

of optical graded index triple focusing lens, the governing equations of the

CMEs, raising the possibility of a large-scale and long-lived internet outage.
To better understand the magnitude of these risks, we monitor voltage changes

other geometric data augmentation methods that perform global transformations
on images, LOMA generates additional training data by randomly magnifying a
local area of the image. This local magnification results in geometric changes
that significantly broaden the range of augmentations while maintaining the
recognizability of objects. Moreover, we extend the idea of LOMA and random
cropping to the feature space to augment the feature map, which further boosts
the classification accuracy considerably. Experiments show that our proposed
LOMA, though straightforward, can be combined with standard data augmentation

businesses increase efficiency, accelerate production, and adapt quickly to
market changes. However, adopting these principles can be challenging.
Practitioners often face an important issue known as vendor lock-in caused by
the cost of tool replacement. In addition, automating the processes that
involve these tools also requires investment. These issues could be addressed
by standardizing service interfaces to facilitate their integration. Linked
Data is an attractive choice for implementing such a standard without
sacrificing versatility. An exciting and promising proposal in this direction
is the OSLC standard specification. Its purpose is to build an environment
where services can interoperate using standard Linked Data models. However, the
current specification version still lacks standard definitions for concepts
that are critical to automating the execution of actions in fast-changing
environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a new specification to extend
OSLC, based on the ECA model, for event-based interoperable automation,
especially for DevOps environments, which are our motivational scenario. A
simple DevOps architecture is built as a prototype to validate the proposed
model. Using that architecture, the proposed model is validated in a real-world

behaviour. In this study, we visualise the search trajectories of a genetic
programming system as graph-based models, where nodes are genotypes/phenotypes
and edges represent their mutational transitions. We also quantitatively
measure the characteristics of phenotypes including their genotypic abundance
(the requirement for neutrality) and Kolmogorov complexity. We connect these
quantified metrics with search trajectory visualisations, and find that more
complex phenotypes are under-represented by fewer genotypes and are harder for
evolution to discover. Less complex phenotypes, on the other hand, are

Efficiently Finding Adversarial Examples with DNN Preprocessing,2022-11-16T06:41:03Z,"Avriti Chauhan, Mohammad Afzal, Hrishikesh Karmarkar, Yizhak Elboher, Kumar Madhukar, Guy Katz","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are everywhere, frequently performing a fairly
complex task that used to be unimaginable for machines to carry out. In doing
so, they do a lot of decision making which, depending on the application, may
be disastrous if gone wrong. This necessitates a formal argument that the
underlying neural networks satisfy certain desirable properties. Robustness is
one such key property for DNNs, particularly if they are being deployed in
safety or business critical applications. Informally speaking, a DNN is not
robust if very small changes to its input may affect the output in a
considerable way (e.g. changes the classification for that input). The task of
finding an adversarial example is to demonstrate this lack of robustness,
whenever applicable. While this is doable with the help of constrained
optimization techniques, scalability becomes a challenge due to large-sized
networks. This paper proposes the use of information gathered by preprocessing

"Effects of the matter Lagrangian degeneracy in $f(Q,T)$ gravity",2022-11-16T16:58:13Z,"José Antonio Nájera, Carlos Aráoz Alvarado","In this paper, we investigated the theoretical and cosmological effects of
the matter Lagrangian degeneracy in an extension of the Symmetric Teleparallel
Equivalent of General Relativity, denoted as $f (Q, T )$ gravity. This
degeneracy comes from the fact that both $\mathcal{L}_m = p$ and $\mathcal{L}_m
= -\rho$ can give rise to the stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid. The
$f(Q,T)$ equations depend on the form of the matter Lagrangian and hence they
also have a degeneracy that has influence on the density evolution of dust
matter and radiation, on the form of the generalized Friedmann equations and
also shows changes in the cosmological parameters confidence regions when
performing Monte Carlo Markov Chains analyses. Our results suggest that since
changing the matter Lagrangian causes different theoretical and cosmological
results, future studies in $f(Q,T)$ gravity should consider both forms of the
matter Lagrangians to account for the different mathematical and observational
results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09042v1
"On the Effect of Pre-training for Transformer in Different Modality on
  Offline Reinforcement Learning",2022-11-17T13:34:08Z,Shiro Takagi,"We empirically investigate how pre-training on data of different modalities,
such as language and vision, affects fine-tuning of Transformer-based models to
Mujoco offline reinforcement learning tasks. Analysis of the internal
representation reveals that the pre-trained Transformers acquire largely
different representations before and after pre-training, but acquire less
information of data in fine-tuning than the randomly initialized one. A closer
look at the parameter changes of the pre-trained Transformers reveals that
their parameters do not change that much and that the bad performance of the
model pre-trained with image data could partially come from large gradients and
gradient clipping. To study what information the Transformer pre-trained with
language data utilizes, we fine-tune this model with no context provided,
finding that the model learns efficiently even without context information.
Subsequent follow-up analysis supports the hypothesis that pre-training with
language data is likely to make the Transformer get context-like information
and utilize it to solve the downstream task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09817v1
Latent User Intent Modeling for Sequential Recommenders,2022-11-17T19:00:24Z,"Bo Chang, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Yuyan Wang, Can Xu, Ed H. Chi, Minmin Chen","Sequential recommender models are essential components of modern industrial
recommender systems. These models learn to predict the next items a user is
likely to interact with based on his/her interaction history on the platform.
Most sequential recommenders however lack a higher-level understanding of user
intents, which often drive user behaviors online. Intent modeling is thus
critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We
propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent
variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational
autoencoders (VAE). The recommendation policy is then adjusted accordingly
given the inferred user intent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent
user intent modeling via offline analyses as well as live experiments on a

Electronic structure of folded hexagonal boron nitride,2022-11-18T10:02:17Z,"Anthony Impellizzeri, Michele Amato, Chris P. Ewels, Alberto Zobelli","Folded regions are commonly encountered in a number of hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) based bulk and nanostructured materials. Two types of structural
modifications occur in folded h-BN layers: local curvature at the folded edges
and interlayer shear of the layers which changes the stacking of the
overlapping flat regions. In this work we discuss, via density functional
theory simulations, the impact of these structural modifications on the ground
state electronic structure of the pristine monolayer. We show that, depending
on the fold orientation, the overlapping region might present different
stacking configurations with subsequent variations of the fundamental band gap;
further gap changes occur at the folded regions. The overall electronic

Spacetime metric for pedestrian movement,2022-11-19T20:32:07Z,Amir Ghorbani,"This paper will present a model for pedestrian motion by defining a spacetime
metric. This model considers the factors that are effective in the movement of
pedestrians (such as obstacles, walls and other pedestrians) by defining a
proper metric. In fact, the surrounding environment that affects the motion of
pedestrians changes the flat(Euclidean) spacetime metric and, therefore, the
shortest possible path to their destination. This change is such that
pedestrians have a different feeling of time at any point and moment in the
environment. Based on this feeling, they adjust their route to the destination
so that they travel the shortest possible route in curved spacetime, which

produce an angular momentum for phonons. In systems with time-reversal
symmetry, the direction of the phonon angular momentum is locked to the phonon
wave vector. Accordingly, this phenomenon has received the name of ``phonon
helicity"". Here, we present a theory to unveil the signatures of such phonon
helicity using Raman scattering. We show that the intensity of Raman scattering
for circularly polarized light in BaMnSb$_2$ (a prototypical nonchiral Dirac
insulator) changes under a reversal of the phonon wave vector, and that the
phonon helicity can be inferred from that change. We compare our results to

Mitigating the risk of tanking in multi-stage tournaments,2022-11-29T10:00:06Z,László Csató,"Multi-stage tournaments consisting of a round-robin group stage followed by a
knockout phase are ubiquitous in sports. However, this format is incentive
incompatible if at least two teams from a group advance to the knockout stage

of tanking in these contests. The suggested approach is applied to the 2022
FIFA World Cup to uncover how its design could have been improved by changing
group labelling (a reform that has received no attention before) and the
schedule of group matches. Scheduling is found to be a surprisingly weak

focus on Normalizing Flows because they can calculate the exact generation
probability likelihood for a given image. We demonstrate taming using models
that generate human faces, a subdomain with many interesting privacy and bias
considerations. Our method can be used in the context of privacy, e.g.,
removing a specific person from the output of a model, and also in the context
of debiasing by forcing a model to output specific image categories according
to a given target distribution. Taming is achieved with a fast fine-tuning

The Panorama of Spin Matrix Theory,2022-11-29T19:00:02Z,"Stefano Baiguera, Troels Harmark, Yang Lei","Spin Matrix theory describes near-BPS limits of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory,
which enables us to probe finite $N$ effects like D-branes and black hole
physics. In previous works, we have developed the spherical reduction and spin
chain methods to construct Spin Matrix theory for various limits. In this
paper, by considering a supercharge $\mathcal{Q}$ which is cubic in terms of
the letters, we construct the Hamiltonian of the largest Spin Matrix theory of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, called the PSU$(1,2|3)$ Spin Matrix theory, as $H =
\{\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{Q}^\dagger \}$. We show the resulting Hamiltonian is
automatically positive definite and manifestly invariant under supersymmetry.
The Hamiltonian is made of basic blocks which transform as supermultiplets. A
novel feature of this Hamiltonian is its division into D-terms and F-terms that
are separately invariant under PSU$(1,2|3)$ symmetry and positive definite. As
all the other Spin Matrix theories arising from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM can be

decreasing monotonically as the SOC strength increasing, the topological
superfluid region shows a dome with the SOC strength increasing. An optimal
region in the phase diagram to find the topological superfluid can be found,
which is important to realize the topological superfluid in optical lattice
experimentally. Then we obtain the change of both band structure and density of

Interaction-aware Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Driving,2022-11-30T14:56:59Z,"Renzi Wang, Mathijs Schuurmans, Panagiotis Patrinos","Lane changing and lane merging remains a challenging task for autonomous
driving, due to the strong interaction between the controlled vehicle and the
uncertain behavior of the surrounding traffic participants. The interaction
induces a dependence of the vehicles' states on the (stochastic) dynamics of
the surrounding vehicles, increasing the difficulty of predicting future
trajectories. Furthermore, the small relative distances cause traditional
robust approaches to become overly conservative, necessitating control methods
that are explicitly aware of inter-vehicle interaction. Towards these goals, we
propose an interaction-aware stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy
integrated with an online learning framework, which models a given driver's
cooperation level as an unknown parameter in a state-dependent probability
distribution. The online learning framework adaptively estimates the
surrounding vehicle's cooperation level with the vehicle's past trajectory and
combines this with a kinematic vehicle model to predict the probability of a
multimodal future state trajectory. The learning is conducted with logistic
regression which enables fast online computation. The multi-future prediction
is used in the MPC algorithm to compute the optimal control input while
satisfying safety constraints. We demonstrate our algorithm in an interactive
lane changing scenario with drivers in different randomly selected cooperation
levels.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17053v1

scores without ground-truth pose supervision. The learned features can be used
together with a classical pose estimator for visual stereo localization. We

the action chosen by the first agent, and then offers a new contract to the
second agent based on this knowledge, thus having the opportunity to explore in

Monte Carlo procedure that includes trapping, energization, and ionization
losses. In a homogeneous medium, trapping and re-energization do not produce a
significant effect. In a nonuniform medium, particles can be trapped for a long
time inside the cloud. This modifies the cosmic ray distribution due to
stochastic acceleration at the highest energies (about 100 MeV). At lower

qualitatively with solid volume fraction $\phi$, and resulting in a force that

classical experiment of Melcher and Taylor are studied. The computed
streamlines of the flow of the heavier dielectric liquid (corn oil)
qualitatively represents the corresponding experimental image. With the
increase of electrocapillary forcing, the flow pattern changes, so that the
main circulation localizes near boundary with a larger electric potential. When
a dielectric liquid is replaced by a poorly conducting one, the system becomes
non-isothermal owing to the Joule heating. Then the flow is driven also by
buoyancy and thermocapillary convection, whose effect becomes noticeably
stronger than the electrocapillary one. With the increase of electric
conductivity, the electrocapillary effect is further weakened compared to the
two others, while the electrocapillary and thermocapillary forces remain
comparable at the central part of the interface, where the thermocapillary

natural construction arising in this context are Wilson loops with alternating
superconnections. This amounts to including ""defect changing operators"" along

Homotopy Theory of Enriched Mackey Functors,2022-12-08T14:06:45Z,"Niles Johnson, Donald Yau","Mackey functors provide the coefficient systems for equivariant cohomology
theories. More generally, enriched presheaf categories provide a classification

enrichments along $K$-theory multifunctors provides an important tool for
constructing spectral Mackey functors from Mackey functors enriched in
algebraic structures such as permutative categories.
  This work gives a detailed development of diagrams, presheaves, and Mackey
functors enriched over closed multicategories. Change of enrichment, including
the relevant compositionality, is treated with care. This framework is applied
to the homotopy theory of enriched diagram and Mackey functor categories,

Effect of surfactants on the elasticity of the liquid--liquid interface,2022-12-09T06:29:08Z,"Shunta Kikuchi, Hiroshi Watanabe","We investigated the effect of surfactants on an interface between two kinds
of liquid by molecular dynamics simulation. We adopted the simple bead-spring
model with two atoms as the surfactants. We controlled the interfacial tension
of the surfactant adsorbed on the interface by changing the bond length.
Although the interface's structure changed depending on the magnitude of the
interfacial tension, the interface was stable even under conditions where the
interfacial tension was virtually zero. The Fourier spectrum of the
fluctuations of the surface structure showed a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$
when the interfacial tension was almost zero, where $q$ is the wavenumber. This
crossover means that the bending rigidity is dominant for the restoring force
when the surfactant molecules are sufficiently absorbed on the interface and
the interfacial tension is almost zero, whereas the interfacial tension is
dominant when the interfacial tension is a finite value.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04686v3

difference in power and information flow among RS EEG in delta (1-3.5 Hz),
alpha (8-13.5 Hz), and beta (14-29.5 Hz) bands. In particular, there was a
marked increase in the alpha band after WM retrieval. In addition, we

the time-changed pseudoprocess is identical in distribution to a mixture of

Impossibility Theorem for Extending Contextuality to Disturbing Systems,2022-12-14T01:54:28Z,"Alisson Tezzin, Elie Wolfe, Barbara Amaral, Matt Jones","Recently there has been interest, and impressive progress, in extending the
definition of contextuality to systems with disturbance. We prove here that
such an endeavor cannot simultaneously satisfy the following core principles of
contextuality: (1) Measuring more information cannot change a contextual system
to a noncontextual one. (2) Classical post-processing cannot create
contextuality: appending new observables that are functions of given
observables cannot change a noncontextual system to a contextual one. (3) The
joint realization of two statistically independent noncontextual systems is
noncontextual. (4) Determinism cannot create contextuality: Any deterministic
system is noncontextual, and adding deterministic observables to a
noncontextual system cannot yield a contextual one. We also prove the same
result without Principle 3, under the stronger version of Principle 4.
Moreover, our results hold for restricted extensions of contextuality that

Missing Corner in the Sky: Massless Three-Point Celestial Amplitudes,2022-12-14T04:38:07Z,"Chi-Ming Chang, Wen-Jie Ma","We present the first computation of three-point celestial amplitudes in
Minkowski space of massless scalars, photons, gluons, and gravitons. Such
amplitudes were previously considered to be zero in the literature because the
corresponding scattering amplitudes in the plane wave basis vanish for finite
momenta due to momentum conservation. However, the delta function for the
momentum conservation has support in the soft and colinear regions, and
contributes to the Mellin and shadow integrals that give non-zero celestial
amplitudes. We further show that when expanding in the (shadow) conformal basis
for the incoming (outgoing) particle wave functions, the amplitudes take the
standard form of correlators in two-dimensional conformal field theory. In
particular, the three-point celestial gluon amplitudes take the form of a
three-point function of a spin-one current with two spin-one primary operators,
which strongly supports the relation between soft spinning particles and

Simplification of Forest Classifiers and Regressors,2022-12-14T08:49:02Z,"Atsuyoshi Nakamura, Kento Sakurada","We study the problem of sharing as many branching conditions of a given
forest classifier or regressor as possible while keeping classification

consider the one that the decision paths of all the given feature vectors must
not change. For a branching condition that a value of a certain feature is at
most a given threshold, the set of values satisfying such constraint can be
represented as an interval. Thus, the problem is reduced to the problem of
finding the minimum set intersecting all the constraint-satisfying intervals
for each set of branching conditions on the same feature. We propose an
algorithm for the original problem using an algorithm solving this problem
efficiently. The constraint is relaxed later to promote further sharing of
branching conditions by allowing decision path change of a certain ratio of the
given feature vectors or allowing a certain number of non-intersected
constraint-satisfying intervals. We also extended our algorithm for both the
relaxations. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments using 21 datasets (13 classification and 8 regression

consists of an attention-equipped navigator module and losses contrasting
deep-feature changes. We propose two model variants, with one contrasting
samples in a binary manner, and another one contrasting samples with learned
prototype variation patterns. The proposed losses are defined with pretrained
deep features, based on our assumption that the features can implicitly reveal
the desired semantic structure including consistency and orthogonality.
Additionally, we design two metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance
of semantic discovery methods on FFHQ dataset, and also show that disentangled

Toxic Liquidation Spirals,2022-12-14T16:10:26Z,"Jakub Warmuz, Amit Chaudhary, Daniele Pinna","On November 22nd 2022, the lending platform AAVE v2 (on Ethereum) incurred
bad debt resulting from a major liquidation event involving a single user who

threshold, and limitations on the number of illiquid coins that can be borrowed
on the platform. In this paper, we argue that the bad debt incurred by AAVE was
not due to excess volatility in CRV/USDC price activity on that day, but rather
a fundamental flaw in the liquidation logic which triggered a toxic liquidation
spiral on the platform. We note that this flaw, which is shared by a number of
major DeFi lending markets, can be easily overcome with simple changes to the
incentives driving liquidations. We claim that halting all liquidations once a
user's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio surpasses a certain threshold value can
prevent future toxic liquidation spirals and offer substantial improvement in
the bad debt that a lending market can expect to incur. Furthermore, we
strongly argue that protocols should enact dynamic liquidation incentives and

Aliasing is a Driver of Adversarial Attacks,2022-12-22T14:52:44Z,"Adrián Rodríguez-Muñoz, Antonio Torralba","Aliasing is a highly important concept in signal processing, as careful
consideration of resolution changes is essential in ensuring transmission and
processing quality of audio, image, and video. Despite this, up until recently
aliasing has received very little consideration in Deep Learning, with all
common architectures carelessly sub-sampling without considering aliasing
effects. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the existence of
adversarial perturbations is due in part to aliasing in neural networks. Our
ultimate goal is to increase robustness against adversarial attacks using
explainable, non-trained, structural changes only, derived from aliasing first
principles. Our contributions are the following. First, we establish a
sufficient condition for no aliasing for general image transformations. Next,
we study sources of aliasing in common neural network layers, and derive simple
modifications from first principles to eliminate or reduce it. Lastly, our
experimental results show a solid link between anti-aliasing and adversarial
attacks. Simply reducing aliasing already results in more robust classifiers,
and combining anti-aliasing with robust training out-performs solo robust
training on $L_2$ attacks with none or minimal losses in performance on
$L_{\infty}$ attacks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11760v1
"Magnetoelasticity-driven phase inversion of ultrafast spin precession in
  NixFe100-x thin films",2022-12-22T16:36:15Z,"Yooleemi Shin, Seongsoo Yoon, Jung-Il Hong, Ji-Wan Kim","We present strong evidences for the deterministic role of magnetoelasticity
in ultrafast spin dynamics of ferromagnetic NixFe100-x alloy films. Without a
change in the crystal structure, we observed sudden Pi-phase inversion of the
spin precession in the range of x = 87.0 - 97.5. In addition, it was found that
the phase was continuously changed and reversed its sign by varying the pump
fluence. These cannot be explained simply by temperature dependence of
magnetocrystalline, demagnetizing, and Zeeman fields which have been
conventionally considered so far in describing the spin dynamics. Through the
temperature- and composition-dependent simulations adding the magnetoelastic
field generated from the lattice thermal strain, we revealed that the
conventional and magnetoelastic fields were competing around x = 95.3, where
the spin dynamics showed the largest phase shift. For analytic understanding,
we further show that the temperature-dependent interplay of the Curie
temperature, saturation magnetization, and magnetostriction, which are
demonstrated to be the most important macroscopic parameters, determines the
ultrafast spin dynamics. Our extensive study emphasizes that magnetoelasticity
is the key ingredient for fully understanding the driving mechanism of
ultrafast spin dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11852v1

Linear features segmentation from aerial images,2022-12-23T18:51:14Z,"Zhipeng Chang, Siddharth Jha, Yunfei Xia","The rapid development of remote sensing technologies have gained significant
attention due to their ability to accurately localize, classify, and segment
objects from aerial images. These technologies are commonly used in unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution cameras or sensors to
capture data over large areas. This data is useful for various applications,
such as monitoring and inspecting cities, towns, and terrains. In this paper,
we presented a method for classifying and segmenting city road traffic dashed
lines from aerial images using deep learning models such as U-Net and SegNet.
The annotated data is used to train these models, which are then used to
classify and segment the aerial image into two classes: dashed lines and
non-dashed lines. However, the deep learning model may not be able to identify
all dashed lines due to poor painting or occlusion by trees or shadows. To
address this issue, we proposed a method to add missed lines to the

On the Level Sets and Invariance of Neural Tuning Landscapes,2022-12-26T19:53:29Z,"Binxu Wang, Carlos R. Ponce","Visual representations can be defined as the activations of neuronal

In a deterministic framework, the digraph of the templex connects cells within

multivariate time series that relaxes the problem of unsupervised MOS to a time
series clustering problem. More specifically, we propose modeling the change in
occupancy of a voxel by a multivariate occupancy time series (MOTS), which
captures spatio-temporal occupancy changes on the voxel level and its
surrounding neighborhood. To perform unsupervised MOS, we train a neural
network in a self-supervised manner to encode MOTS into voxel-level feature

self-feedback. Such feedback control is achieved by coupling the acoustic field
of the combustor to itself through a single coupling tube attached near the
anti-node position of the acoustic standing wave. We observe that the amplitude
and dominant frequency of the limit cycle oscillations gradually decrease as
the length of the coupling tube is increased. Complete suppression (AD) of
these oscillations is observed when the length of the coupling tube is nearly
3/8 times the wavelength of the fundamental acoustic mode of the combustor.
Meanwhile, as we approach this state of amplitude death, the dynamical behavior
of acoustic pressure changes from the state of limit cycle oscillations to
low-amplitude chaotic oscillations via intermittency. We also study the change
in the nature of the coupling between the unsteady flame dynamics and the
acoustic field as the length of the coupling tube is increased. We find that
the temporal synchrony between these oscillations changes from the state of
synchronized periodicity to desynchronized aperiodicity through intermittent
synchronization. Furthermore, we reveal that the application of delayed

which it stays similar even when looking at decadal timescales. On the other

substitution with Li or K. On the contrary, the elastic moduli showed a strong
dependence on the type of the modifier, as they increased with increasing mean
field strength. Similarly, the mobility of the glass elements was significantly
affected by the type of modifier used to substitute Na. The change of the
properties is further discussed and explained using changes at the short- and
medium-range structure by giving evidence of previous experimental findings.
Finally, we highlight the origin of the non-existence of the MAE, the effect of
the modifier on the bioactivity of the glasses, the importance of dynamical
descriptors in predicting the bioactivity of oxide glasses, and we provide the
necessary insights, at the atomic scale, needed for further development of
bioactive glasses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05033v1
"Constraining a late time transition of $G_{\rm eff}$ using low-z galaxy
  survey data",2022-01-15T13:04:18Z,"G. Alestas, L. Perivolaropoulos, K. Tanidis","It has recently been pointed out that a gravitational transition taking place
at a recent redshift $z_t$, reducing the effective gravitational constant
$G_{\rm eff}$ by about $10\%$ for $z>z_t$, has the potential to lead to a
resolution of the Hubble tension if $z_t\lesssim 0.01$. Since $H(z)^2\sim
G_{\rm eff}$, such a transition would also lead to sharp change of the slope of
the Hubble diagram at $z=z_t$ and a sharp decrease in the number of galaxies
per redshift bin at $z_t$. Here we attempt to impose constraints on such a
transition by using two robust low-z redshift survey datasets ($z<0.01$), taken
from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) as well as the 2MASS Redshift
Survey (2MRS). In both surveys, we bin the data in redshift bins and focus on
the number of galaxies in each bin ($\Delta N(z_i)$). We observe a peak in the
distribution of galaxies near a distance of approximately 20 Mpc in both
datasets. This feature could be attributed to galactic density fluctuations, to
coherent peculiar velocities of galaxies or to an ultra late-time gravitational
transition in the same era. In the context of the later scenario we show that
this feature could have been induced by a sharp change of $G_{\rm eff}$ by
$\Delta G_{\rm eff}/G_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.6$ at $z_t\simeq 0.005$. Thus, in a
conservative approach, this method can be used to impose constraints on a
possible abrupt change of the gravitational constant taking place at very low
redshifts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05846v2
"Online Change Point Detection for Weighted and Directed Random Dot
  Product Graphs",2022-01-26T22:48:39Z,"Bernardo Marenco, Paola Bermolen, Marcelo Fiori, Federico Larroca, Gonzalo Mateos","Given a sequence of random (directed and weighted) graphs, we address the
problem of online monitoring and detection of changes in the underlying data
distribution. Our idea is to endow sequential change-point detection (CPD)
techniques with a graph representation learning substrate based on the
versatile Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model. We consider efficient, online
updates of a judicious monitoring function, which quantifies the discrepancy
between the streaming graph observations and the nominal RDPG. This reference
distribution is inferred via spectral embeddings of the first few graphs in the
sequence. We characterize the distribution of this running statistic to select
thresholds that guarantee error-rate control, and under simplifying
approximations we offer insights on the algorithm's detection resolution and
delay. The end result is a lightweight online CPD algorithm, that is also
explainable by virtue of the well-appreciated interpretability of RDPG
embeddings. This is in stark contrast with most existing graph CPD approaches,
which either rely on extensive computation, or they store and process the
entire observed time series. An apparent limitation of the RDPG model is its
suitability for undirected and unweighted graphs only, a gap we aim to close
here to broaden the scope of the CPD framework. Unlike previous proposals, our
non-parametric RDPG model for weighted graphs does not require a priori
specification of the weights' distribution to perform inference and estimation.
This network modeling contribution is of independent interest beyond CPD. We
offer an open-source implementation of the novel online CPD algorithm for
weighted and direct graphs, whose effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated
via (reproducible) synthetic and real network data experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11222v1
Optimal Spend Rate Estimation and Pacing for Ad Campaigns with Budgets,2022-02-04T20:18:00Z,"Bhuvesh Kumar, Jamie Morgenstern, Okke Schrijvers","Online ad platforms offer budget management tools for advertisers that aim to
maximize the number of conversions given a budget constraint. As the volume of
impressions, conversion rates and prices vary over time, these budget
management systems learn a spend plan (to find the optimal distribution of
budget over time) and run a pacing algorithm which follows the spend plan.
  This paper considers two models for impressions and competition that varies
with time: a) an episodic model which exhibits stationarity in each episode,
but each episode can be arbitrarily different from the next, and b) a model
where the distributions of prices and values change slowly over time. We
present the first learning theoretic guarantees on both the accuracy of spend
plans and the resulting end-to-end budget management system. We present four
main results: 1) for the episodic setting we give sample complexity bounds for
the spend rate prediction problem: given $n$ samples from each episode, with
high probability we have $|\widehat{\rho}_e - \rho_e| \leq
\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ where $\rho_e$ is the optimal spend rate for the
episode, $\widehat{\rho}_e$ is the estimate from our algorithm, 2) we extend
the algorithm of Balseiro and Gur (2017) to operate on varying, approximate
spend rates and show that the resulting combined system of optimal spend rate
estimation and online pacing algorithm for episodic settings has regret that
vanishes in number of historic samples $n$ and the number of rounds $T$, 3) for
non-episodic but slowly-changing distributions we show that the same approach
approximates the optimal bidding strategy up to a factor dependent on the
rate-of-change of the distributions and 4) we provide experiments showing that
our algorithm outperforms both static spend plans and non-pacing across a wide
variety of settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05881v1

Gladstone, Jari Kajava, Roberto Soria, Luca Zampieri","NGC 1313 X-2 is one of the few known pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources
(PULXs), and so is thought to contain a neutron star that accretes at highly
super-Eddington rates. However, the physics of this accretion remains to be
determined. Here we report the results of two simultaneous XMM-Newton and HST
observations of this PULX taken to observe two distinct X-ray behaviours as
defined from its Swift light curve. We find that the X-ray spectrum of the PULX
is best described by the hard ultraluminous (HUL) regime during the observation
taken in the lower flux, lower variability amplitude behaviour; its spectrum
changes to a broadened disc during the higher flux, higher variability
amplitude epoch. However, we see no accompanying changes in the optical/UV
fluxes, with the only difference being a reduction in flux in the near-IR as
the X-ray flux increased. We attempt to fit irradiation models to explain the
UV/optical/IR fluxes but they fail to provide meaningful constraints. Instead,
a physical model for the system leads us to conclude that the optical light is
dominated by a companion O/B star, albeit with an IR excess that may be
indicative of a jet. We discuss how these results may be consistent with the
precession of the inner regions of the accretion disc leading to changes in the
observed X-ray properties, but not the optical, and whether we should expect to
observe reprocessed emission from ULXs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06986v1

magnetar Swift~J1818.0-1607 at radio and X-ray wavelengths over a span of one
year. We obtained a coherent timing solution for the magnetar over the same
time span. The frequency derivative of the magnetar shows systematic variation
with the values oscillating about a mean value of $-$1.37$\times$10$^{-11}$ Hz
s$^{-1}$. The magnitude of the variation in the frequency derivative reduces
with time before converging on the mean value. We were able to identify four
states in the spin-frequency derivative that were quantified by the amount of
modulation about the mean value and the transition between these states seem to
be correlated with the change in the radio emission of the magnetar while no
correlation is seen in the average radio profile variability on a shorter
timescale (days). The 0.5--12 keV X-ray flux shows a monotonic decrease that
can be attributed to thermal emission from a hot-spot on the surface of the
neutron star that is reducing in size. Such decrease is consistent with what is
seen in other magnetars. The potential correlation between the radio emission
mode and the behaviour of the spin-down rate hints to a global change in the
magnetopshere of the magnetar akin to the correlation seen in a subset of
mode-changing radio pulsars and suggests a physical link between the two
sub-populations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07548v1

  case-study of Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La R{é}union",2022-02-23T14:42:03Z,"Guillaume Mauri, Ginette Saracco, Philippe Labazuy, Glyn Williams-Jones","Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La R{\'e}union Island, is a basaltic shield
volcano which underwent an intense cycle of eruptive activity between 1998 and
2008. Self-potential and other geophysical investigations of the volcano have
shown the existence of a well-established hydrothermal system within the summit
cone. The present study investigates the relationship between changes in the
hydrothermal system and eruptive activity at the summit cone of Piton de la
Fournaise. Here, we consider the depth of the hydrothermal activity section to
be the area where the hydrothermal flow is the most intense along its path. Ten
complete-loop self-potential surveys have been analyzed through multi-scale
wavelet tomography (MWT) to characterize depth variations of the hydrothermal
system between 1993 and 2008. Our MWT models strongly support the existence of
six main hydrothermalflow pathways associated with the main edifice structure.
Each of these pathways is part of the main hydrothermal system and is connected
to the main hydrothermal reservoir at depth. In both 2006 and 2008, around
Dolomieu crater, based on our results, the hydrothermal activity sections are
located between 2300 and 2500 m a.s.l., which correlate well with the elevation
of the observed fumarole belt within the post-2007-collapse crater wall. Our
results show that the depths of the local hydrothermal activity sections change
substantially over the investigated period. Vertical displacement of the main
potential generation area, associated withthese hydrothermal activity sections,
is observed on the order of several hundred meters at the transition between
the period of quiescence (1993--1997) and the resumption of eruptive activity
in 1998 and 2007, respectively. From 1999 to March 2008, the hydrothermal
system was consistently located at relatively shallow depths.By quantitatively
determining the vertical displacement of hydrothermal fluids over 16 years, we
identify a significant link between hydrothermal system and magmatic activity.
Hydrothermal system depth below the surface is an indicator of the activity
level (pressurization/depressurization of the volcano) within the
shallowmagmatic systems. Thus, when used in conjunction with long term volcano
monitoring, this approach can contribute substantially to detection of the
precursory signals of changes in volcanic activity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11543v1

  using thermosensitive host `mesogels'",2022-03-08T21:30:20Z,"J. S. Behra, A. Thiriez, D. Truzzolillo, L. Ramos, L. Cipelletti","The key parameter controlling the glass transition of colloidal suspensions
is $\varphi$, the fraction of the sample volume occupied by the particles.
Unfortunately, changing $\varphi$ by varying an external parameter,
\textit{e.g.} temperature $T$ as in molecular glass formers, is not possible,
unless one uses thermosensitive colloidal particles, like the popular
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgels. These however have several
drawbacks, including high deformability, osmotic deswelling and
interpenetration, which complicate their use as a model system to study the
colloidal glass transition. Here, we propose a new system consisting of a
colloidal suspension of non-deformable spherical silica nanoparticles, in which
PNiPAM hydrogel spheres of ~$100-200 \mu m$ size are suspended. These
non-colloidal `mesogels' allow for controlling the sample volume effectively
available to the silica nanoparticles and hence their $\varphi$, thanks to the
$T$-induced change in mesogels volume. Using optical microscopy, we first show
that the mesogels retain their ability to change size with $T$ when suspended
in Ludox suspensions, similarly as in water. We then show that their size is
independent of the sample thermal history, such that a well-defined, reversible
relationship between $T$ and $\varphi$ may be established. Finally, we use
space-resolved dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that, upon varying $T$,
our system exhibits a broad range of dynamical behaviors across the glass
transition and beyond, comparable with those exhibited by a series of distinct
silica nanoparticle suspensions of various $\varphi$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04407v1
A novel method for adaptive control of deformable mirrors,2022-03-09T17:52:04Z,Aleksandar Haber,"For sufficiently wide ranges of applied control signals (control voltages),
MEMS and piezoelectric Deformable Mirrors (DMs), exhibit nonlinear behavior.
The nonlinear behavior manifests itself in nonlinear actuator couplings,
nonlinear actuator deformation characteristics, and in the case of
piezoelectric DMs, hysteresis. Furthermore, in a number of situations, DM
behavior can change over time, and this requires a procedure for updating the
DM models on the basis of the observed data. If not properly modeled and if not
taken into account when designing control algorithms, nonlinearities, and
time-varying DM behavior, can significantly degrade the achievable closed-loop
performance of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Widely used approaches for DM
control are based on pre-estimated linear time-invariant DM models in the form
of influence matrices. Often, these models are not being updated during system
operation. Consequently, when the nonlinear DM behavior is excited by control
signals with wide operating ranges, or when the DM behavior changes over time,
the state-of-the-art DM control approaches relying upon linear control methods,
might not be able to produce a satisfactory closed-loop performance of an AO
system. Motivated by these key facts, we present a novel method for data-driven
DM control. Our approach combines a simple open-loop control method with a
recursive least squares method for dynamically updating the DM model. The DM
model is constantly being updated on the basis of the dynamically changing DM
operating points. That is, the proposed method updates both the control actions
and the DM model during the system operation. We experimentally verify this
approach on a Boston Micromachines MEMS DM with 140 actuators. Preliminary
experimental results reported in this manuscript demonstrate good potential for
using the developed method for DM control.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04915v1

cyberattacks keeps increasing as Internet usage continues to grow. An intrusion
detection system (IDS) is an alarm system that helps to detect cyberattacks. As
new types of cyberattacks continue to emerge, researchers focus on developing
machine learning (ML) based IDS to detect zero-day attacks. Researchers usually
remove some or all attack samples from the training dataset and only include
them in the testing dataset when evaluating the performance of an IDS on
detecting zero-day attacks. Although this method may show the ability of an IDs
to detect unknown attacks; however, it does not reflect the long-term
performance of the IDS as it only shows the changes in the type of attacks. In
this paper, we focus on evaluating the long-term performance of ML based IDS.
To achieve this goal, we propose evaluating the ML-based IDS using a dataset
that is created later than the training dataset. The proposed method can better
assess the long-term performance of an ML-based IDS, as the testing dataset
reflects the changes in the type of attack and the changes in network
infrastructure over time. We have implemented six of the most popular ML models
that are used for IDS, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF),
support vector machine (SVM), na\""ive Bayes (NB), artificial neural network
(ANN) and deep neural network (DNN). Our experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 and
the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets show that SVM and ANN are most resistant to
overfitting. Besides that, our experiment results also show that DT and RF
suffer the most from overfitting, although they perform well on the training
dataset. On the other hand, our experiments using the LUFlow dataset have shown
that all models can perform well when the difference between the training and

and the electric-field-induced topological phase transition in AB-stacked
MoTe${}_2$/WSe${}_2$ moir\'e heterobilayers at $\nu=1$ hole filling. We suggest
that the Chern band of the QAH state is generated from an intrinsic band
inversion composed of the highest two moir\'e hole bands with opposite valley
numbers and a gap opening induced by two Coulomb-interaction-driven magnetic
orders. These magnetic orders, including an in-plane $120^{\circ}$-N\'eel order
and an in-plane ferromagnetic order, interact with moir\'e bands via
corresponding in-plane exchange fields. The N\'eel order ensures the insulating
gap, the ferromagnetic order induces the non-zero Chern number, and both orders
contribute to time-reversal symmetry breaking. The N\'eel order is acquired
from the Hartree-Fock exchange interaction, and the formation of ferromagnetic
order is attributed to interlayer-exciton condensation and exciton
ferromagnetism. The exciton ferromagnetism can be demonstrated by excitonic
Bose-Hubbard physics and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In low
electric fields, the equilibrium state is a Mott-insulator state. At a certain
electric field, a correlated insulating state composed of the hole-occupied
band and the exciton condensate becomes a new thermodynamically stable phase,
and the topological phase transition occurs as the ferromagnetic order emerges.
The consistency between the present theory and experimental observations is
discussed. Experimental observations, including the
spin-polarized/valley-coherent nature of the QAH state, the absence of charge
gap closure at the topological phase transition, the canted spin texture, and
the insulator-to-metal transition, are interpreted by the mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10088v4
METL: a modern ETL pipeline with a dynamic mapping matrix,2022-03-19T10:18:51Z,"Christian Haase, Timo Röseler, Mattias Seidel","Modern ETL streaming pipelines extract data from various sources and forward
it to multiple consumers, such as data warehouses (DW) and analytical systems
that leverage machine learning (ML). However, the increasing number of systems
that are connected to such pipelines requires new solutions for data
integration. The canonical (or common) data model (CDM) offers such an
integration. It is particular useful for integrating microservice systems into
ETL pipelines. (Villaca et al 2020, Oliveira et al 2019) However, a mapping to
a CDM is complex. (Lemcke et al 2012) There are three complexity problems,
namely the size of the required mapping matrix, the automation of updates of
the matrix in response to changes in the extraction sources and the time
efficiency of the mapping. In this paper, we present a new solution for these
problems. More precisely, we present a new dynamic mapping matrix (DMM), which
is based on permutation matrices that are obtained by block-partitioning the
full mapping matrix. We show that the DMM can be used for automated updates in
response to schema changes, for parallel computation in near real-time and for
highly efficient compacting. For the solution, we draw on research into matrix
partitioning (Quinn 2004) and dynamic networks (Haase et al 2021). The DMM has

SCBH) by rescaling the string coupling parameter in a $D$-dimensional
Callan-Myers-Perry black hole. From the theoretical point of view, the most
interesting findings are that the string corrections coincide with the
so-called generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections to black hole
solutions, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy acquires logarithmic corrections, and
that there exists a critical value of the coupling parameter for which the
black hole temperature vanishes. We also find that, due to the string
corrections the nature of the central singularity may be altered from spacelike
to timelike singularity. In addition, we study the possibility of testing such
a black hole with astrophysical observations. Since the dilaton field does not
decouple from the metric it is not a priori clear that the resulting 4D SCBH
offers only small corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole. We used motion
of the S2 star around the black hole at the center of our galaxy to constrain
the parameters (the string coupling parameter and ADM mass) of the 4D SCBH. To
test the weak gravity regime we calculate the deflection angle in this geometry
and apply it to gravitational lensing. To test the strong field regime, we
calculate the black hole shadow radius. While we find that the observables
change as we change the string coupling parameter, the magnitude of the change
is too small to distinguish it from the Schwarzschild black hole. With the
current precision, to the leading order terms, the 4D SCBH cannot be
distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10957v1
Linear and nonlinear parabolic forward-backward problems,2022-03-21T15:45:07Z,"Anne-Laure Dalibard, Frédéric Marbach, Jean Rax","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the well-posedness of several
linear and nonlinear equations with a parabolic forward-backward structure, and
to highlight the similarities and differences between them. The epitomal linear
example will be the stationary Kolmogorov equation $y\partial_x u
-\partial_{yy} u=f$ in a rectangle. We first prove that this equation admits a
finite number of singular solutions, of which we provide an explicit
construction. Hence, the solutions to the Kolmogorov equation associated with a
smooth source term are regular if and only if $f$ satisfies a finite number of
orthogonality conditions. This is similar to well-known phenomena in elliptic
problems in polygonal domains.
  We then extend this theory to a Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck system, and
to two quasilinear equations: the Burgers type equation $u \partial_x u -
\partial_{yy} u = f$ in the vicinity of the linear shear flow, and the Prandtl
system in the vicinity of a recirculating solution, close to the line where the
horizontal velocity changes sign. We therefore revisit part of a recent work by
Iyer and Masmoudi. For the two latter quasilinear equations, we introduce a
geometric change of variables which simplifies the analysis. In these new
variables, the linear differential operator is very close to the Kolmogorov
operator $y\partial_x -\partial_{yy}$. Stepping on the linear theory, we prove
existence and uniqueness of regular solutions for data within a manifold of
finite codimension, corresponding to some nonlinear orthogonality conditions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11067v5
"Influence of the vessel wall geometry on the wall-induced migration of
  red blood cells",2022-03-23T00:59:20Z,"Ying Zhang, Thomas G. Fai","The geometry of the blood vessel wall plays a regulatory role on the motion
of red blood cells (RBCs). The overall topography of the vessel wall depends on
many features, among which the endothelial lining of the endothelial surface
layer (ESL) is an important one. The endothelial lining of vessel walls
presents a large surface area for exchanging materials between blood and
tissues. The ESL plays a critical role in regulating vascular permeability,
hindering leukocyte adhesion as well as inhibiting coagulation during
inflammation. Changes in the ESL structure are believed to cause vascular
hyperpermeability and entrap immune cells during sepsis, which could
significantly alter the vessel wall geometry and disturb interactions between
RBCs and the vessel wall, including the wall-induced migration of RBCs and the
thickening of a cell-free layer. To investigate the influence of the vessel
wall geometry particularly changed by the ESL under various pathological
conditions, such as sepsis, on the motion of RBCs, we developed two models to
represent the ESL using the immersed boundary method in two dimensions. In
particular, we used simulations to study how the lift force and drag force on a
RBC near the vessel wall vary with different wall thickness, spatial variation,
and permeability associated with changes in the vessel wall geometry. We find
that the spatial variation of the wall has a significant effect on the
wall-induced migration of the RBC for a high permeability, and that the
wall-induced migration is significantly inhibited as the vessel diameter is
increased.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12113v4

a multi-state electrically-programmed low-loss non-volatile photonic memory
based on a broadband transparent phase change material (Ge2Sb2Se5, GSSe) with
ultra-low absorption in the amorphous state. A zero-static-power and
electrically-programmed multi-bit P-RAM is demonstrated on a
silicon-on-insulator platform, featuring efficient amplitude modulation up to
0.2 dB/{\mu}m and an ultra-low insertion loss of total 0.12 dB for a 4-bit
memory showing a 100x improved signal to loss ratio compared to other
phase-change-materials based photonic memories. We further optimize the
positioning of dual micro-heaters validating performance tradeoffs.
Experimentally we demonstrate a half-a million cyclability test showcasing the

"CharacterBERT and Self-Teaching for Improving the Robustness of Dense
  Retrievers on Queries with Typos",2022-04-01T23:02:50Z,"Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon","Current dense retrievers are not robust to out-of-domain and outlier queries,
i.e. their effectiveness on these queries is much poorer than what one would
expect. In this paper, we consider a specific instance of such queries: queries
that contain typos. We show that a small character level perturbation in
queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness of dense
retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in the
input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is
performed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a
typo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after
tokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input
embeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then
turn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such
queries with typos, while still being as performant as previous methods on
queries without typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder
and an efficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that
distills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos.
Experimental results show that CharacterBERT in combination with ST achieves
significantly higher effectiveness on queries with typos compared to previous
methods. Along with these results and the open-sourced implementation of the
methods, we also provide a new passage retrieval dataset consisting of
real-world queries with typos and associated relevance assessments on the MS
MARCO corpus, thus supporting the research community in the investigation of
effective and robust dense retrievers. Code, experimental results and dataset
are made available at https://github.com/ielab/CharacterBERT-DR.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00716v2
Convective Line Shifts in the Spectra of Solar-Type Stars,2022-04-02T10:30:31Z,V. A. Sheminova,"The Doppler line shifts in the spectra of the Sun and stars with effective
temperatures from 4800 to 6200 K were measured and the average connective
(granulation) velocities were estimated. The absolute scale of the line shifts
for the stars was established on the basis of the derived dependence of the
shifts of solar lines on optical depth. For FGK solar-type stars, curves of
convection velocities as a function of the height in the atmosphere in a large
range of heights from 150 to 700 km were obtained for the first time. All these
curves indicate a decrease in blue shifts with height, which means that the
granulation velocities through the photosphere slow down to zero. In the lower
chromosphere, red shifts of strong Mg I lines are observed, which indicate a
change in the direction of granulation velocities to the opposite and confirm
the effects of reversal of granulation at heights above 600 km. In cooler K
stars, granulation shifts change with height on average from -50 to 100 m/s,
while they change more sharply in hotter FG stars from -700 to 300 m/s. The
gradient of the line shift curves increases with an increase in the effective
temperature and a decrease in gravity, metallicity, and age of the star. The
connective velocity of the star averaged over all analyzed heights increases
from -90 to -560 m/s from colder to hotter stars. It correlates with
macroturbulence, asymmetry of spectral lines, and the rotation velocity of the
star. We also obtained the radial velocities of the stars and compared them
with the SIMBAD data. Our analysis has shown that the individual granular
velocities of the stars must be taken into account when determining the radial
velocities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00830v1
"Goodbye Tracking? Impact of iOS App Tracking Transparency and Privacy
  Labels",2022-04-07T16:32:58Z,"Konrad Kollnig, Anastasia Shuba, Max Van Kleek, Reuben Binns, Nigel Shadbolt","Tracking is a highly privacy-invasive data collection practice that has been
ubiquitous in mobile apps for many years due to its role in supporting
advertising-based revenue models. In response, Apple introduced two significant
changes with iOS 14: App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a mandatory opt-in system
for enabling tracking on iOS, and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which disclose what
kinds of data each app processes. So far, the impact of these changes on
individual privacy and control has not been well understood. This paper
addresses this gap by analysing two versions of 1,759 iOS apps from the UK App
Store: one version from before iOS 14 and one that has been updated to comply
with the new rules.
  We find that Apple's new policies, as promised, prevent the collection of the
Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier for cross-app tracking.
Smaller data brokers that engage in invasive data practices will now face
higher challenges in tracking users - a positive development for privacy.
However, the number of tracking libraries has roughly stayed the same in the
studied apps. Many apps still collect device information that can be used to
track users at a group level (cohort tracking) or identify individuals
probabilistically (fingerprinting). We find real-world evidence of apps
computing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through the use
of server-side code, thereby violating Apple's policies. We find that Apple
itself engages in some forms of tracking and exempts invasive data practices
like first-party tracking and credit scoring. We also find that the new Privacy
Nutrition Labels are sometimes inaccurate and misleading.
  Overall, our findings suggest that, while tracking individual users is more
difficult now, the changes reinforce existing market power of gatekeeper
companies with access to large troves of first-party data and motivate a
countermovement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03556v4
Forgetting and Imbalance in Robot Lifelong Learning with Off-policy Data,2022-04-12T15:40:53Z,"Wenxuan Zhou, Steven Bohez, Jan Humplik, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Dushyant Rao, Markus Wulfmeier, Tuomas Haarnoja, Nicolas Heess","Robots will experience non-stationary environment dynamics throughout their
lifetime: the robot dynamics can change due to wear and tear, or its
surroundings may change over time. Eventually, the robots should perform well
in all of the environment variations it has encountered. At the same time, it
should still be able to learn fast in a new environment. We identify two
challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL) under such a lifelong learning
setting with off-policy data: first, existing off-policy algorithms struggle
with the trade-off between being conservative to maintain good performance in
the old environment and learning efficiently in the new environment, despite
keeping all the data in the replay buffer. We propose the Offline Distillation
Pipeline to break this trade-off by separating the training procedure into an
online interaction phase and an offline distillation phase.Second, we find that
training with the imbalanced off-policy data from multiple environments across
the lifetime creates a significant performance drop. We identify that this
performance drop is caused by the combination of the imbalanced quality and
size among the datasets which exacerbate the extrapolation error of the
Q-function. During the distillation phase, we apply a simple fix to the issue
by keeping the policy closer to the behavior policy that generated the data. In
the experiments, we demonstrate these two challenges and the proposed solutions
with a simulated bipedal robot walk-ing task across various environment
changes. We show that the Offline Distillation Pipeline achieves better
performance across all the encountered environments without affecting data
collection. We also provide a comprehensive empirical study to support our
hypothesis on the data imbalance issue.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05893v2
"CPU- and GPU-based Distributed Sampling in Dirichlet Process Mixtures
  for Large-scale Analysis",2022-04-19T16:35:44Z,"Or Dinari, Raz Zamir, John W. Fisher III, Oren Freifeld","In the realm of unsupervised learning, Bayesian nonparametric mixture models,
exemplified by the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), provide a principled
approach for adapting the complexity of the model to the data. Such models are
particularly useful in clustering tasks where the number of clusters is
unknown. Despite their potential and mathematical elegance, however, DPMMs have
yet to become a mainstream tool widely adopted by practitioners. This is
arguably due to a misconception that these models scale poorly as well as the
lack of high-performance (and user-friendly) software tools that can handle
large datasets efficiently. In this paper we bridge this practical gap by
proposing a new, easy-to-use, statistical software package for scalable DPMM
inference. More concretely, we provide efficient and easily-modifiable
implementations for high-performance distributed sampling-based inference in
DPMMs where the user is free to choose between either a multiple-machine,
multiple-core, CPU implementation (written in Julia) and a multiple-stream GPU
implementation (written in CUDA/C++). Both the CPU and GPU implementations come
with a common (and optional) python wrapper, providing the user with a single
point of entry with the same interface. On the algorithmic side, our
implementations leverage a leading DPMM sampler from (Chang and Fisher III,
2013). While Chang and Fisher III's implementation (written in MATLAB/C++) used
only CPU and was designed for a single multi-core machine, the packages we
proposed here distribute the computations efficiently across either multiple
multi-core machines or across mutiple GPU streams. This leads to speedups,
alleviates memory and storage limitations, and lets us fit DPMMs to
significantly larger datasets and of higher dimensionality than was possible
previously by either (Chang and Fisher III, 2013) or other DPMM methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08988v1

suppressed below 1.8 K. For $x$-values greater than 0.016, signatures of a
magnetic transition can be detected in both thermodynamic and transport
measurements in which kink-like features allow for the determination of the
transition temperature, $T^*$, that increases as Mn substitution increases. A
temperature-composition ($T$-$x$) phase diagram is constructed, revealing a
half-dome of superconductivity with the magnetic transition temperature, $T^*$,

(AIIA). Chatbots are especially important as they are often the first
interaction of clients with a business and are the entry point of a business
into the AI (Artificial Intelligence) world. The quality of the chatbot is,
therefore, key. However, as is the case in general with AIIAs, it is especially
challenging to assess and control the quality of chatbot systems. Beyond the
inherent statistical nature of these systems, where occasional failure is
acceptable, we identify two major challenges. The first is to release an
initial system that is of sufficient quality such that humans will interact
with it. The second is to maintain the quality, enhance its capabilities,
improve it and make necessary adjustments based on changing user requests or
drift. These challenges exist because it is impossible to predict the real
distribution of user requests and the natural language they will use to express
these requests. Moreover, any empirical distribution of requests is likely to
change over time. This may be due to periodicity, changing usage, and drift of
topics.
  We provide a methodology and set of technologies to address these challenges
and to provide automated assistance through a human-in-the-loop approach. We
notice that it is crucial to connect between the different phases in the
lifecycle of the chatbot development and to make sure it provides its expected
business value. For example, that it frees human agents to deal with tasks
other than answering human users. Our methodology and technologies apply during
chatbot training in the pre-production phase, through to chatbot usage in the

Ia Supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early time u-band light curve shows an
excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early-excess
blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few
days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca II H&K feature passing
from the u to the B bands on the time scale of a few days. This effect could be
dominant for all SNe Ia which have broad absorption features and early-time
velocities over 25,000 km/s. It is likely to be one of the main causes of
early-excess u-band flux in SNe Ia which have early-time high-velocities. This
effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the
SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The
rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in
the u-band. For objects which explode at lower velocities, and have a more
structured shape in the early-excess emission, there must also be an additional
parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early time observations, in
particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect
is within SNe Ia.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00606v2

concentration. While the depletion interaction experienced by these biopolymers

Modeling changes caused by humans is essential for building digital twins,

sensor setup used to capture the interactions needs to be inexpensive and
easy-to-use for non-expert users. I.e., interactions should be captured and
modeled by simple ego-centric sensors such as a combination of cameras and IMU
sensors, not relying on any external cameras or object trackers. Yet, to the
best of our knowledge, no work tackling the challenging problem of modeling
human-scene interactions via such an ego-centric sensor setup exists. This
paper closes this gap in the literature by developing a novel approach that
combines visual localization of humans in the scene with contact-based
reasoning about human-scene interactions from IMU data. Interestingly, we can
show that even without visual observations of the interactions, human-scene
contacts and interactions can be realistically predicted from human pose

$-4.8$. The mean $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ shows a similar change with
respect to the $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ variability amplitude for
intermediately-active G stars. We also combine our results with archival

and valley physics in monolayer and multilayer TMDs. In this work, we present
our systematic study of VBM splitting ($\Delta$) in atomically thin MoS$_2$ and
WS$_2$ by employing photocurrent spectroscopy as we change the temperature and
the layer numbers. We found that VBM splitting in monolayer MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$
depends strongly on temperature, which contradicts the theory that spin-orbit
coupling solely determines the VBM splitting in monolayer TMDs. We also found
that the rate of change of VBM splitting with respect to temperature
($m=\frac{\partial\Delta}{\partial T}$) is the highest for monolayer (-0.14
meV/K for MoS$_2$) and the rate decreases as the layer number increases ($m ~

electronic band structure and optical absorption for a bilayer MoS$_2$ with
different interlayer separations. Our simulations agree with the experimental
observations and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of VBM splitting
in atomically thin monolayer and multilayer TMDs originates from the changes in
the interlayer coupling strength between the neighboring layers. By studying
two different types of TMDs and many different layer thicknesses, we also
demonstrate that VBM splitting also depends on the layer numbers and type of

atmospheres on the polarization of scattered stellar radiation. We considered a
selection of 25 cloud condensates that are expected to be present in extrasolar
planetary atmospheres. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code POLARIS and assuming Mie scattering theory, we calculated and
studied the net polarization of scattered radiation as a function of planetary
phase angle at optical to near-infrared wavelengths. In addition to the
well-known characteristics in the state of polarization, such as the rainbow
determined by the real part of the refractive index, the behavior of the
underlying imaginary part of the refractive index causes an increase or
decrease in the degree of polarization and a change of sign in the polarization
at a characteristic wavelength. In contrast to Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgFeSiO$_4$,
clouds composed of SiO, MnS, Na$_2$S, or ZnS produce a rapidly decreasing
degree of polarization with increasing wavelength in the context of an
exoplanetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the sign of the polarization changes at a
wavelength of about 0.5 $\mu$m to 0.6 $\mu$m, depending on the specific cloud
condensate. The resulting net polarization is mainly positive for cloud
compositions with large imaginary parts of the refractive index, such as Fe,
FeS, and FeO. In addition, for Fe and FeS clouds, the maximum degree of
polarization at long wavelengths is shifted to larger phase angles than for
FeO. We found that most of these cloud condensates are distinguishable from
each other due to their unique wavelength-dependent complex refractive index.
In particular, an increase or decrease of the net polarization as a function of
wavelength and a change of sign in the polarization at specific wavelengths are
important features for characterizing cloud compositions in exoplanetary
atmospheres.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04815v1
"Holography, Application, and String Theory's Changing Nature",2022-05-10T20:46:04Z,Lauren Greenspan,"Based on string theory's framework, the gauge/gravity duality, also known as
holography, has the ability to solve practical problems in low energy physical
systems like metals and fluids. Holographic applications open a path for
conversation and collaboration between the theory-driven, high energy culture
of string theory and fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics, which in
contrast place great emphasis on the empirical evidence that experiment
provides. This paper takes a look at holography's history, from its roots in
string theory to its present-day applications that are challenging the cultural
identity of the field. I will focus on two of these applications: holographic
QCD and holographic superconductivity, highlighting some of the (often
incompatible) historical influences, motives, and epistemic values at play, as
well as the subcultural shifts that help the collaborations work. The extent to
which holographic research -- arguably string theory's most successful and
prolific area -- must change its subcultural identity in order to function in
fields outside of string theory reflects its changing nature and the field's
uncertain future. Does string theory lose its identity in the low-energy
applications that holography provides? Does holography still belong under
string theory's umbrella, or is it destined to form new subcultures with each
of its fields of application? I find that the answers to these questions are
dynamic, interconnected, and highly dependent on string theory's relationship
with its field of application. In some cases, holography can maintain the goals
and values it inherited from string theory. In others, it instead adopts the
goals and values of the field in which it is applied. These examples highlight
a need for the STS community to expand its treatment of string theory beyond

exclusive decisions and policies. Faced with similar challenges in dealing with
an increasingly diversified audience, the museum sector has seen changes in
theory and practice, particularly in the areas of representation and
meaning-making. While rarity and grandeur used to be at the centre stage of the
early museum practices, folk life and museums' relationships with the diverse
communities they serve become a widely integrated part of the contemporary
practices. These changes address issues of diversity and accessibility in order
to offer more socially inclusive services. Drawing on these changes and
reflecting back on the AI world, we argue that the museum experience provides
useful lessons for building AI with socially inclusive approaches, especially
in situations in which both a collection and access to it will need to be
curated or filtered, as frequently happens in search engines, recommender
systems and digital libraries. We highlight three principles: (1) Instead of
upholding the value of neutrality, practitioners are aware of the influences of
their own backgrounds and those of others on their work. By not claiming to be
neutral but practising cultural humility, the chances of addressing potential
biases can be increased. (2) There should be room for situational
interpretation beyond the stages of data collection and machine learning.
Before applying models and predictions, the contexts in which relevant parties
exist should be taken into account. (3) Community participation serves the

considerable traction as a psychologically grounded solution for explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). Recent innovations introduce the notion of
computational plausibility for automatically generated CFEs, enhancing their
robustness by exclusively creating plausible explanations. However, practical
benefits of such a constraint on user experience and behavior is yet unclear.
In this study, we evaluate objective and subjective usability of
computationally plausible CFEs in an iterative learning design targeting novice
users. We rely on a novel, game-like experimental design, revolving around an
abstract scenario. Our results show that novice users actually benefit less
from receiving computationally plausible rather than closest CFEs that produce
minimal changes leading to the desired outcome. Responses in a post-game survey
reveal no differences in terms of subjective user experience between both
groups. Following the view of psychological plausibility as comparative
similarity, this may be explained by the fact that users in the closest
condition experience their CFEs as more psychologically plausible than the
computationally plausible counterpart. In sum, our work highlights a
little-considered divergence of definitions of computational plausibility and
psychological plausibility, critically confirming the need to incorporate human
behavior, preferences and mental models already at the design stages of XAI

  Context? A Naturalistic Study",2022-05-12T14:30:50Z,"Arash Tavakoli, Nathan Lai, Vahid Balali, Arsalan Heydarian","Understanding and mitigating drivers' negative emotions, stress levels, and
anxiety is of high importance for decreasing accident rates, and enhancing road
safety. While detecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly
help with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in
drivers' negative emotions and high stress level, might better help with
planning interventions. While studies have provided significant insight into
detecting drivers' emotions and stress levels, not many studies focused on the
reasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study,
by using a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the
driving scene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between
the ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'
psychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). Our
results indicate that different road objects might be associated with varying
levels of increase in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative
facial emotions detected through computer vision. Larger vehicles on the road,
such as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest amount of increase in
drivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, shorter distances and
higher standard deviation in the distance to the lead vehicle are associated
with a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a possible
increase in stress level. Our finding indicates more positive emotions, lower
facial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of
driving, which often happens in highway environments. This research
collectively shows that driving at higher speeds happening in highways by
avoiding certain road objects might be a better fit for keeping drivers in a
calmer, more positive state.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06116v2
"A rigorous multi-population multi-lane hybrid traffic model and its
  mean-field limit for dissipation of waves via autonomous vehicles",2022-05-13T22:17:04Z,"Nicolas Kardous, Amaury Hayat, Sean T. McQuade, Xiaoqian Gong, Sydney Truong, Tinhinane Mezair, Paige Arnold, Ryan Delorenzo, Alexandre Bayen, Benedetto Piccoli","In this paper, a multi-lane multi-population microscopic model, which
presents stop and go waves, is proposed to simulate traffic on a ring-road.
Vehicles are divided between human-driven and autonomous vehicles (AV). Control
strategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small number of AVs
(less than 5\% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that
can smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves. This
in turn may reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
  The lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as
parameters in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of
these parameters in the lane-change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic
accurately, because different parameter values can lead to drastically
different traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the
speed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. Despite this
modeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs,
the stabilization of uniform flow steady-state is effective for any realistic
value of the parameters, and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue.
Our approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models, which
allows a limit procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology,
mean-field. In simple words, from increasing the human-driven population to
infinity, a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations are
obtained. Moreover, control problems also pass to the limit, allowing the
design to be tackled at different scales.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06913v1
"Narrowing the LOCAL$\unicode{x2013}$CONGEST Gaps in Sparse Networks via
  Expander Decompositions",2022-05-17T05:06:24Z,"Yi-Jun Chang, Hsin-Hao Su","Many combinatorial optimization problems can be approximated within $(1 \pm
\epsilon)$ factors in $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$ rounds in the LOCAL
model via network decompositions [Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus, STOC 2018]. These
approaches require sending messages of unlimited size, so they do not extend to
the CONGEST model, which restricts the message size to be $O(\log n)$ bits.
  In this paper, we develop a generic framework for obtaining $\text{poly}(\log
n, 1/\epsilon)$-round $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for many
combinatorial optimization problems, including maximum weighted matching,
maximum independent set, and correlation clustering, in graphs excluding a
fixed minor in the CONGEST model. This class of graphs covers many sparse
network classes that have been studied in the literature, including planar
graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and bounded-treewidth graphs.
  Furthermore, we show that our framework can be applied to give an efficient
distributed property testing algorithm for an arbitrary minor-closed graph
property that is closed under taking disjoint union, significantly generalizing
the previous distributed property testing algorithm for planarity in [Levi,
Medina, and Ron, PODC 2018 & Distributed Computing 2021].
  Our framework uses distributed expander decomposition algorithms [Chang and
Saranurak, FOCS 2020] to decompose the graph into clusters of high conductance.
We show that any graph excluding a fixed minor admits small edge separators.
Using this result, we show the existence of a high-degree vertex in each
cluster in an expander decomposition, which allows the entire graph topology of
the cluster to be routed to a vertex. Similar to the use of network
decompositions in the LOCAL model, the vertex will be able to perform any local
computation on the subgraph induced by the cluster and broadcast the result
over the cluster.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08093v1
"Accounting for stellar activity signals in radial-velocity data by using
  Change Point Detection techniques",2022-05-23T08:50:08Z,"U. Simola, A. Bonfanti, X. Dumusque, J. Cisewski-Kehe, S. Kaski, J. Corander","Active regions on the photosphere of a star have been the major obstacle for
detecting Earth-like exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) method. A
commonly employed solution for addressing stellar activity is to assume a
linear relationship between the RV observations and the activity indicators
along the entire time series, and then remove the estimated contribution of
activity from the variation in RV data (overall correction method). However,
since active regions evolve on the photosphere over time, correlations between
the RV observations and the activity indicators will correspondingly be
anisotropic. We present an approach that recognizes the RV locations where the
correlations between the RV and the activity indicators significantly change in
order to better account for variations in RV caused by stellar activity. The
proposed approach uses a general family of statistical breakpoint methods,
often referred to as change point detection (CPD) algorithms; several
implementations of which are available in R and python. A thorough comparison
is made between the breakpoint-based approach and the overall correction
method. To ensure wide representativity, we use measurements from real stars
that have different levels of stellar activity and whose spectra have different
signal-to-noise ratios. When the corrections for stellar activity are applied
separately to each temporal segment identified by the breakpoint method, the
corresponding residuals in the RV time series are typically much smaller than
those obtained by the overall correction method. Consequently, the generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodogram contains a smaller number of peaks caused by active
regions. The CPD algorithm is particularly effective when focusing on active
stars with long time series, such as alpha Cen B.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11136v2

  of temperature and helium-gas pressure",2022-05-27T16:08:39Z,"Yassine Agarmani, Steffi Hartmann, Jan Zimmermann, Elena Gati, Caroline Delleske, Ulrich Tutsch, Bernd Wolf, Michael Lang","We report the realization of an advanced technique for measuring relative
length changes $\Delta L/L$ of mm-sized samples under control of temperature
($T$) and helium-gas pressure ($P$). The system, which is an extension of the
apparatus described in Manna et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 83, 085111 (2012),
consists of two $^4$He-bath cryostats each of which houses a pressure cell and
a capacitive dilatometer. The interconnection of the pressure cells, the
temperature of which can be controlled individually, opens up various modes of
operation to perform measurements of $\Delta L/L$ under variation of
temperature and pressure. Special features of this apparatus include the
possibilities (1) to increase the pressure to values much in excess of the
external pressure reservoir, (2) to substantially improve the pressure
stability during temperature sweeps, (3) to enable continuous pressure sweeps
both with decreasing and increasing pressure, and (4) to simultaneously measure
the dielectric constant of the pressure-transmitting medium helium,
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}^{\mathrm{He}}(T,P)$, along the same $T$-$P$
trajectory as used for taking the $\Delta L(T,P)/L$ data. The performance of
the setup is demonstrated by measurements of relative length changes $(\Delta

"The role of ecosystem transpiration in creating alternate moisture
  regimes by influencing atmospheric moisture convergence",2022-05-29T12:46:22Z,"Anastassia M. Makarieva, Andrei V. Nefiodov, Antonio Donato Nobre, Mara Baudena, Ugo Bardi, Douglas Sheil, Scott R. Saleska, Ruben D. Molina, Anja Rammig","The terrestrial water cycle links the soil and atmosphere moisture reservoirs
through four fluxes: precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and atmospheric
moisture convergence (net import of water vapor to balance runoff). Each of
these processes is essential for human and ecosystem well-being. Predicting how
the water cycle responds to changes in vegetation cover remains a challenge.
Recently, changes in plant transpiration across the Amazon basin were shown to
be associated disproportionately with changes in rainfall, suggesting that even
small declines in transpiration (e.g., from deforestation) would lead to much
larger declines in rainfall. Here, constraining these results by the law of
mass conservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere, forest
transpiration can control atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased
transpiration enhances atmospheric moisture import and resulting water yield.
Conversely, in a sufficiently dry atmosphere increased transpiration reduces
atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. This previously unrecognized
dichotomy can explain the otherwise mixed observations of how water yield
responds to re-greening, as we illustrate with examples from China's Loess
Plateau. Our analysis indicates that any additional precipitation recycling by
additional vegetation increases precipitation but decreases local water yield
and steady-state runoff. Therefore, in the drier regions and early stages of
ecological restoration, the role of vegetation can be confined to precipitation
recycling, while once a wetter stage is achieved, additional vegetation
enhances atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. Evaluating the
transition between regimes, and recognizing the potential of vegetation for
enhancing moisture convergence, are crucial for characterizing the consequences
of deforestation and for motivating and guiding ecological restoration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14646v4

evolution in terms of its diameter variation on Computed Tomography (CT) scans
and then provide a follow-up recommendation according to the predicted result
of the growing trend of the nodule. In order to improve the performance of
growth trend prediction for lung nodules, it is vital to compare the changes of
the same nodule in consecutive CT scans. Motivated by this, we screened out
4,666 subjects with more than two consecutive CT scans from the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST) dataset to organize a temporal dataset called NLSTt. In
specific, we first detect and pair regions of interest (ROIs) covering the same
nodule based on registered CT scans. After that, we predict the texture
category and diameter size of the nodules through models. Last, we annotate the
evolution class of each nodule according to its changes in diameter. Based on
the built NLSTt dataset, we propose a siamese encoder to simultaneously exploit
the discriminative features of 3D ROIs detected from consecutive CT scans. Then
we novelly design a spatial-temporal mixer (STM) to leverage the interval
changes of the same nodule in sequential 3D ROIs and capture spatial
dependencies of nodule regions and the current 3D ROI. According to the
clinical diagnosis routine, we employ hierarchical loss to pay more attention
to growing nodules. The extensive experiments on our organized dataset

nuclear transients. In early 2018, this well-known AGN underwent a
changing-look event, in which broad optical emission lines appeared and the
optical flux increased. Yet, by July 2018, the X-ray flux had dropped by over
two orders of magnitude, indicating a dramatic change to the inner accretion
flow. With three years of observations with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, we
present the X-ray evolution of 1ES 1927+654, which can be broken into three
phases-(1) an early super-Eddington phase with rapid variability in X-ray
luminosity and spectral parameters, (2) a stable super-Eddington phase at the
peak X-ray luminosity, and (3) a steady decline back to the pre-outburst
luminosity and spectral parameters. For the first time, we witnessed the
formation of the X-ray corona, as the X-ray spectrum transitioned from
thermally-dominated to primarily Comptonized. We also track the evolution of
the prominent, broad 1 keV feature in the early X-ray spectra and show that
this feature can be modeled with blueshifted reflection (z = -0.33) from a
single-temperature blackbody irradiating spectrum using xillverTDE, a new
flavor of the xillver models. Thus, we propose that the 1 keV feature could
arise from reflected emission off the base of an optically thick outflow from a
geometrically thick, super-Eddington inner accretion flow, connecting the inner
accretion flow with outflows launched during extreme accretion events (e.g.
tidal disruption events). Lastly, we compare 1ES 1927+654 to other nuclear
transients and discuss applications of xillverTDE to super-Eddington accretors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05140v1

using proper motions measured with the Hubble Space Telescope. For most
clusters in the sample, this is the first energy equipartition study ever
performed. This study is also the largest of its kind, albeit with only 9
clusters. We begin by rigorously cleaning the catalogues to remove poor-quality
measurements and to ensure high signal-to-noise for the study. Using the
cleaned catalogues, we investigate how velocity dispersion $\sigma$ changes
with stellar mass $m$. We fit two functional forms: the first, a classic
power-law of the form $\sigma \propto m^{-\eta}$ where $\eta$ is the degree of
energy equipartition, and the second from Bianchini et al. (2016) parameterised
by an equipartition mass $m_{eq}$ where $\eta$ changes with stellar mass. We
find that both functions fit well but cannot distinguish with statistical
significance which function provides the best fit. All clusters exhibit varying
degrees of partial equipartition; no cluster is at or near full equipartition.
We search for correlations of $\eta$ and $m_{eq}$ with various cluster
properties. The most significant correlation is observed with the number of
core or median relaxation times ($N_{core}$ or $N_{half}$) the cluster has
experienced. Finally, we determine the radial equipartition profile for each
cluster, that is, how the degree of equipartition changes with projected
distance from the cluster centre. We do not detect statistically significant
trends in the degree of equipartition with radius. Overall, our observational
findings are in broad agreement with theoretical predictions from N-body models

changes has become a norm for learning various language downstream tasks.
However, for non-language downstream tasks, a common practice is to employ
task-specific designs for input, output layers, and loss functions. For

replacing the word embedding layer with an image patch embedding layer, the
word token output layer with a 10-way output layer, and the word prediction
loss with a 10-way classification loss, respectively. A natural question
arises: Can LM fine-tuning solve non-language downstream tasks without changing
the model architecture or loss function? To answer this, we propose
Language-Interfaced Fine-Tuning (LIFT) and study its efficacy and limitations

with existing SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS spectroscopy where the H$\beta$ emission line
profile does not completely disappear in any epochs. Additionally, we have
gathered older/newer spectral epochs from all the available SDSS data releases
to make the database more complete. We use PyQSOFit and perform a homogeneous
spectral decomposition of all of our SDSS spectra and tabulate the AGN
continuum and emission line properties per epoch per source, chronologically.
This further allows us to categorize the sources in our sample as
\textit{Turn-On} or \textit{Turn-Off} and subsequently check for repeated
occurrences of such phases. We then estimate the black hole mass (M$_{\rm BH}$)
and the Eddington ratio (L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$) per epoch per source
where the required parameters are available and well-estimated. We realize the
movement of the source in the M$_{\rm BH}$ versus L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$

corresponding particle interpretation for these fluctuations is flexible, and
we clarify the role of this choice at the level of calculations and their
diagrammatic interpretation. We consider several possibilities aside from the
standard Bunch Davies vacuum prescription for the initial state, and trace the
change in pole structure as one begins adding excitations; starting from just a
single particle, to highly excited states and special cases such as a coherent
state. We illustrate - with the example of coherent states - the subtleties in
concluding a Bunch Davies initial state from the absence of physical poles in
the bispectrum, which is interesting in light of some recent literature.
Initial states with a finite number of excitations are plagued with
disconnected diagrams isolated in phase space, and we highlight their
implications on the observation of these signals, and how the situation changes
as one begins to excite more and more particles. We also comment about the
implications of various initial conditions on the squeezed limit of the

The Fast Flavor Instability in Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows,2022-07-21T18:00:03Z,"Rodrigo Fernández, Sherwood Richers, Nicole Mulyk, Steven Fahlman","We examine the effect of neutrino flavor transformation by the fast flavor
instability (FFI) on long-term mass ejection from accretion disks formed after
neutron star mergers. Neutrino emission and absorption in the disk set the
composition of the disk ejecta, which subsequently undergoes $r$-process
nucleosynthesis upon expansion and cooling. Here we perform 28 time-dependent,
axisymmetric, viscous-hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around
hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) of variable lifetime, using a 3-species
neutrino leakage scheme for emission and an annular-lightbulb scheme for
absorption. We include neutrino flavor transformation due the FFI in a
parametric way, by modifying the absorbed neutrino fluxes and temperatures,
allowing for flavor mixing at various levels of flavor equilibration, and also
in a way that aims to respect the lepton-number preserving symmetry of the
neutrino self-interaction Hamiltonian. We find that for a promptly-formed black
hole (BH), the FFI lowers the average electron fraction of the disk outflow due
to a decrease in neutrino absorption, driven primarily by a drop in electron
neutrino/antineutrino flux upon flavor mixing. For a long-lived HMNS, the disk
emits more heavy lepton neutrinos and reabsorbs more electron neutrinos than
for a BH, with a smaller drop in flux compensated by a higher neutrino
temperature upon flavor mixing. The resulting outflow has a broader electron
fraction distribution, a more proton-rich peak, and undergoes stronger
radiative driving. Disks with intermediate HMNS lifetimes show results that

outflow is moderate, with changes in mass ejection, average velocity, and
average electron fraction of order $\sim 10\%$, and changes in the
lanthanide/actinide mass fraction of up to a factor $\sim 2$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10680v2
"Can radial motions in the stellar halo constrain the rate of change of
  mass in the Galaxy?",2022-07-24T13:33:01Z,"Sanjib Sharma, Joss Bland-Hawthorn, Joseph Silk, Celine Boehm","A change in the mass of the Galaxy with time will leave its imprint on the
motions of the stars, with stars having radially outward (mass loss) or inward
(mass accretion) bulk motions. Here we test the feasibility of using the mean
radial motion of stars in the stellar halo to constrain the rate of change of
mass in the Galaxy, for example, due to decay of dark matter into invisible
dark sector particles or more conservatively from the settling of baryons. In
the current $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of structure formation, the stellar halo is
formed by accretion of satellites onto the host galaxy. Over time, as the
satellites disrupt and phase mix, the mean radial motion $\langle V_{R}
\rangle$ of the stellar halo is eventually expected to be close to zero. But
most halos have substructures due to incomplete mixing of specific accretion
events and this can lead to nonzero $\langle V_{R} \rangle$ in them. Using
simulations, we measure the mean radial motion, $\langle V_{R} \rangle$, of
stars in 13 $\Lambda$CDM stellar halos lying in a spherical shell of radius 30
kpc. We find that for most halos, the shell motion is quite small, with 75\% of
halos having $\langle V_{R}\rangle \lesssim 1.2 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$. When
substructures are removed by using a clustering algorithm, $\langle
V_{R}\rangle$ is reduced even further, with 75\% of halos having $\langle
V_{R}\rangle \lesssim 0.6 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$. A value of $\langle V_{R}\rangle
\approx 0.6 \ {\rm km}s^{-1}$ can be attained corresponding to a galactic mass
loss rate of 2\% per Gyr. We show that this can place constraints on dark
matter decay parameters such as the decay lifetime and the kick velocity that
is imparted to the daughter particle. The advent of all-sky stellar surveys
involving millions to billions of stars is encouraging for detecting signatures
of dark matter decay.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11739v1
"4-component relativistic Hamiltonian with effective QED potentials for
  molecular calculations",2022-07-28T14:14:51Z,"Ayaki Sunaga, Maen Salman, Trond Saue","We report the implementation of effective QED potentials for all-electron
4-component relativistic molecular calculations using the DIRAC code. The
potentials are also available for 2-component calculations, proper
picture-change being mandatory. Specificially, we have implemented the Uehling
potential [E. A. Uehling, Phys. Rev. 48 , 55 (1935)] for vacuum polarization
and two effective potentials [P. Pyykk\""o and L.-B. Zhao, J. Phys. B 36 , 1469

for electron self-energy. We provide extensive theoretical background for these
potentials. We report the following sample applications: i) we confirm the
conjecture of Pyykk\""o that QED effects are observable for the AuCN molecule by
directly calculating ground-state rotational constants $B_0$ of the three
isotopomers studied by MW spectroscopy; QED brings the corresponding
substitution Au-C bond length $r_s$ from 0.23 to 0.04 pm agreement with
experiment, ii) spectroscopic constants of van der Waals dimers M$_2$ (M=Hg,
Rn, Cn, Og) iii) there is a significant change of valence s population of Pb in
the reaction PbH$_4$ -> PbH$_2$ + H$_2$, which is thereby a good candidate for
observing QED effects in chemical reactions, as proposed in [K. G. Dyall et
al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 348 , 497 (2001)]. QED contributes 0.32 kcal/mol to the
reaction energy, thereby reducing its magnitude by -1.27 %. For corresponding
hydrides of superheavy flerovium, the electronic structures are quite similar.
Interestingly, the QED contribution to the reaction energy is of quite similar
magnitude (0.35 kcal/mol), whereas the relative change is significantly smaller
(-0.50 %). This curious observation can be explained by the faster increase of
negative vacuum polarization over positive electron self-energy contributions
as a function of nuclear charge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14101v1

  Stellar Object G036.70+00.09",2022-08-02T14:11:49Z,"Mizuho Uchiyama, Kohei Ichikawa, Koichiro Sugiyama, Yoshihiro Tanabe, Yoshinori Yonekura","We present the discovery of the simultaneous flux variation of a massive
young stellar object (MYSO) G036.70+00.09 (G036.70) both in the maser emission
and mid-infrared (MIR;$\lambda=3$--$5$~$\mu$m) bands. Utilizing the ALLWISE and
NEOWISE archival databases covering a long time span of approximately 10 years
with a cadence of 6 months, we confirmed that G036.70 indicates a stochastic
year-long MIR variability with no signs of the WISE band color change of W1
(3.4~$\mu$m) $-$W2 (4.6~$\mu$m). Cross-matching the MIR data set with the
high-cadence 6.7~GHz class II methanol maser flux using a Hitachi 32-m radio
telescope that discovered its periodicity in the methanol maser of 53.0--53.2
days, we also determine the flux correlations between the two bands at two
different timescales, year-long and day-long, both of which have never been
reported in MYSOs except when they are in a state of the accretion burst phase.
The results of our study support the scenario that a class II methanol maser is
pumped up by infrared emission from accreting disks of MYSOs. We also discuss
the possible origins of MIR and maser variability. To explain the two observed
phenomena, a stochastic year-long MIR variability with no signs of significant
color change and maser-MIR variability correlation, change in mass accretion
rate and line-of-sight extinction because of nonaxisymmetric dust density
distribution in a rotating accretion disk are possible origins. Observations
through spectroscopic monitoring of accretion-related emission lines are
essential for determining the origin of the observed variability in G036.70.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01473v1

the interesting changing-look AGN (CLAGN) Mrk~590 using two decades of
multi-wavelength observations from \xmm{}, \suzaku{}, \swift{} and \nustar{}.
In the light of vanishing soft excess in this CLAGN, we test two models, ""the
warm Comptonization"" and ""the ionized disk reflection"" using extensive UV/X-ray
spectral analysis. Our main findings are: (1) the soft X-ray excess emission,
last observed in 2004, vanished in 2011, and never reappeared in any of the
later observations, (2) we detected a significant variability ($\sim300\%$) in
the observed optical-UV and power-law flux between observations with the lowest
state ($L_{\rm bol} = 4.4\times 10^{43}\, erg\, s^{-1}$, in 2016) and the
highest state ($L_{\rm bol} = 1.2\times 10^{44}\, erg\, s^{-1}$, in 2018), (3)
the UV and power-law fluxes follow same temporal pattern, (4) the photon index
showed a significant variation ($\Gamma=1.88^{+0.02}_{-0.08}$ and
$\Gamma=1.58^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ in 2002 and 2021 respectively) between
observations, (5) no Compton hump was detected in the source spectra but a
narrow Fe$K_{\alpha}$ line is present in all observations, (6) we detected a
high-energy cut-off in power-law continuum ($92^{+55}_{-25} \rm keV$ and
$60^{+10}_{-08} \rm keV$) with the latest \nustar{} observations, (7) the warm
Comptonization model needs an additional diskbb component to describe the
source UV bump, (8) there is no correlation between the Eddington rate and the
soft excess as found in other changing-look AGNs. We conclude that given the
spectral variability in UV/X-rays, the ionized disk reflection or the warm
Comptonization models may not be adequate to describe the vanishing soft excess

When costly migration helps to improve cooperation,2022-08-10T08:29:59Z,"Hsuan-Wei Lee, Colin Cleveland, Attila Szolnoki","Motion is a typical reaction among animals and humans trying to reach better
conditions in a changing world. This aspect has been studied intensively in
social dilemmas where competing players' individual and collective interests
are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where
players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are
present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change
their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly,
these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain
their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly.
Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by
its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly
biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of
parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher
cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population
density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the
presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern
changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow.
In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called
Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they
subsequentially transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence,
paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a
higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be
isolated otherwise.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05214v2
The Sense of Logging in the Linux Kernel,2022-08-13T13:04:17Z,"Keyur Patel, Joao Faccin, Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj, Ingrid Nunes","Logging plays a crucial role in software engineering because it is key to
perform various tasks including debugging, performance analysis, and detection
of anomalies. Despite the importance of log data, the practice of logging still
suffers from the lack of common guidelines and best practices. Recent studies
investigated logging in C/C++ and Java open-source systems. In this paper, we
complement these studies by conducting the first empirical study on logging
practices in the Linux kernel, one of the most elaborate open-source
development projects in the computer industry. We analyze 22 Linux releases
with a focus on three main aspects: the pervasiveness of logging in Linux, the
types of changes made to logging statements, and the rationale behind these
changes. Our findings show that logging code accounts for 3.73% of the total
source code in the Linux kernel, distributed across 72.36% of Linux files. We
also found that the distribution of logging statements across Linux subsystems
and their components vary significantly with no apparent reasons, suggesting
that developers use different criteria when logging. In addition, we observed a
slow decrease in the use of logging-reduction of 9.27% between versions v4.3
and v5.3. The majority of changes in logging code are made to fix language
issues, modify log levels, and upgrade logging code to use new logging
libraries, with the overall goal of improving the precision and consistency of
the log output. Many recommendations are derived from our findings such as the
use of static analysis tools to detect log-related issues, the adoption of
common writing styles to improve the quality of log messages, the development
of conventions to guide developers when selecting log levels, the establishment
of review sessions to review logging code, and so on. [...]",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06640v1
"Holistic Natural Systems -- Design & Steering, Guiding New Science for
  Transformation",2022-08-15T00:02:24Z,Jessie Henshaw,"Like all natural systems, great societies and their cultures emerge by a
growth process from their environments, developing, organized, and behaving as
wholes with their internal designs linked with their external worlds. So the
general patterns of how growth produces both successful and failing new designs
for new systems can be a great teacher of what does and does not successfully
work. Our own world culture imperils its survival by being unresponsive to
change as our world economy has; driven to endlessly maximize its compound
growth and so growing conflict with internal and external systems. New methods
now let us compare different kinds of growth systems in their natural contexts
to expose their different ways of coupling with their contexts and steering in
response to their futures. Some work out fine by respecting internal limits and
finding a fit with external parts, and so working adaptively for survival as a
whole. For living systems, steering is much improved by rich experience of
external contexts, allowing more prompt attention and response to new risks and
opportunities. Recognizing emerging systems starts with noticing change
associated with a growing center of relationships, a nucleus of activity in a
nourishing place, something sprouting. Storms, trees, relationships, organisms,
businesses, organizations, cultures, etc., all start as emerging centers of
design that develop by capturing resources from their contexts to expand their
ability to capture more. As such, growth begins and develops as a natural
exploratory process, starting with compound growth and needing to creatively
respond to its natural limits to achieve long life and a stable place in the
world. The coupling of internal human thoughts and external worlds matters,
too; however, only indirectly connected with our contexts, our fixed images of
a changing world can blind us to the meanings of life.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06945v1

  test for astrochemical models",2022-08-16T11:22:28Z,"B. Müller, B. M. Giuliano, A. Vasyunin, G. Fedoseev, P. Caselli","Context. The gas and ice-grain chemistry of the pre-stellar core L1544 has
been the subject of several observations and modelling studies conducted in the
past years. The chemical composition of the ice mantles reflects the
environmental physical changes along the temporal evolution. The investigation
outcome hints at a layered structure of interstellar ices with mainly H$_2$O in
the inner layers and an increasing amount of CO near the surface. The
morphology of interstellar ice analogues can be investigated experimentally.
Aims. This research presents a new approach of a three-dimensional fit where
observational results are first fitted with a gas-grain chemical model. Then,
based on the numerical results the laboratory IR spectra are recorded for
interstellar ice analogues in a layered and in a mixed morphology. These
results can then be compared with future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
observations. Special attention is paid to the inclusion of the IR inactive
species N$_2$ and O$_2$. Methods. Ice analogue spectra containing the most
abundant predicted molecules were recorded at a temperature of 10 K using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. In the case of layered ice we
deposited a H$_2$O-CO-N$_2$-O$_2$ mixture on top of a H2O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$ ice,
while in the case of mixed ice we examined a H$_2$O-CH$_3$OH-N$_2$-CO
composition. Results. Following the changing composition and structure of the
ice, we find differences in the absorption bands for most of the examined
vibrational modes. The extent of observed changes in the IR band profiles will
allow us to analyse the structure of ice mantles in L1544 from future
observations by the JWST. Conclusions. The comparison of our spectroscopic
measurements with upcoming JWST observations is crucial in order to put
stringent constraints on the chemical and physical structure of dust icy
mantles, and to explain surface chemistry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07672v2

in all aspects of materials research. Despite the enormous breadth of
information that can be extracted from these techniques, the challenge of
radiation-induced sample change and damage remains prevalent. This is largely
due to the emergence of modern, high-intensity X-ray source technologies and
growing potential to carry out more complex, longer duration in-situ or
in-operando studies. The tunability of synchrotron beamlines enables the
routine application of photon energy-dependent experiments. This work explores
the structural stability of [Rh(COD)Cl]2, a widely used catalyst and precursor
in the chemical industry, across a range of beamline parameters that target
X-ray energies of 8 keV, 15 keV, 18 keV and 25 keV, on a powder X-ray
diffraction synchrotron beamline at room temperature. Structural changes are
discussed with respect to absorbed X-ray dose at each experimental setting
associated with the respective photon energy. In addition, the X-ray radiation
hardness of the catalyst is discussed, by utilising the diffraction data at the
different energies to determine a dose limit, which is often considered in
protein crystallography and typically overlooked in small molecule
crystallography. This work not only gives fundamental insight into how damage

Null and time-like geodesics in Kerr-Newman black hole exterior,2022-08-25T07:41:06Z,"Chen-Yu Wang, Da-Shin Lee, Chi-Yong Lin","We study the null and time-like geodesics of the light and the neutral
particles respectively in the exterior of Kerr-Newman black holes. The geodesic
equations are known to be written as a set of first-order differential
equations in Mino time from which the angular and radial potentials can be
defined. We classify the roots for both potentials, and mainly focus on those
of the radial potential with an emphasis on the effect from the charge of the
black holes. We then obtain the solutions of the trajectories in terms of the
elliptical integrals and the Jacobian elliptic functions for both null and
time-like geodesics, which are manifestly real functions of the Mino time that
the initial conditions can be explicitly specified. We also describe the
details of how to reduce those solutions into the cases of the spherical
orbits. The effect of the black hole's charge decreases the radii of the
spherical motion of the light and the particle for both direct and retrograde
motions. In particular, we focus on the light/particle boomerang of the
spherical orbits due to the frame dragging from the back hole's spin with the
effect from the charge of the black hole. To sustain the change of the
azimuthal angle of the light rays, say for example $\Delta \phi=\pi$ during the
whole trip, the presence of the black hole's charge decreases the radius of the
orbit and consequently reduces the needed values of the black hole's spin. As
for the particle boomerang, the particle's inertia renders smaller change of
the angle $\Delta \phi$ as compared with the light boomerang. Moreover, the
black hole's charge also results in the smaller angle change $\Delta \phi$ of
the particle than that in the Kerr case. The implications of the obtained
results to observations are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11906v1

and re-use deep neural network models that are trained only on images for
similar analytics tasks on videos. In this paper, we show that this leap of
faith that deep learning models that work well on images will also work well on
videos is actually flawed. We show that even when a video camera is viewing a
scene that is not changing in any human-perceptible way, and we control for
external factors like video compression and environment (lighting), the
accuracy of video analytics application fluctuates noticeably. These
fluctuations occur because successive frames produced by the video camera may
look similar visually, but these frames are perceived quite differently by the
video analytics applications. We observed that the root cause for these
fluctuations is the dynamic camera parameter changes that a video camera
automatically makes in order to capture and produce a visually pleasing video.
The camera inadvertently acts as an unintentional adversary because these
slight changes in the image pixel values in consecutive frames, as we show,
have a noticeably adverse impact on the accuracy of insights from video
analytics tasks that re-use image-trained deep learning models. To address this
inadvertent adversarial effect from the camera, we explore the use of transfer
learning techniques to improve learning in video analytics tasks through the
transfer of knowledge from learning on image analytics tasks. In particular, we
show that our newly trained Yolov5 model reduces fluctuation in object
detection across frames, which leads to better tracking of objects(40% fewer

previously identified as an unusual field object based on its strong IR excess
and variable near-IR spectrum. Multiple epochs of low-resolution (R~150)
near-IR spectra show large-amplitude (~0.1-0.5 mag) continuum variations on
timescales of days to 12 years, unlike the small-amplitude variability typical
for field ultracool dwarfs. The variations between epochs are well-modeled as
changes in the relative extinction ($\Delta{A_V}\approx2$ mag). Likewise,
Pan-STARRS optical photometry varies on timescales as long as 11 years (and
possibly as short as an hour) and implies similar amplitude $A_V$ changes.
NEOWISE mid-IR light curves also suggest changes on 6-month timescales, with
amplitudes consistent with the optical/near-IR extinction variations. However,
near-IR spectra, near-IR photometry, and optical photometry obtained in the
past year indicate the source can also be stable on hourly and monthly
timescales. From comparison to objects of similar spectral type, the total
extinction of 2MASS J0619-2903 seems to be $A_V\approx4-6$ mag, with perhaps
epochs of lower extinction. Gaia EDR3 finds that 2MASS J0619-2903 has a
wide-separation (1.2' = 10450 AU) stellar companion, with an isochronal age of
$31^{+22}_{-10}$ Myr and a mass of $0.30^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ Msun. Adopting this
companion's age and EDR3 distance (145.2$\pm$0.6 pc), we estimate a mass of
0.11-0.17 Msun for 2MASS J0619-2903. Altogether, 2MASS J0619-2903 appears to
possess an unusually long-lived primordial circumstellar disk, perhaps making

Libraries (TPLs), Maven adopts Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to standardize the
underlying meaning of versions, but users could still confront abnormal
execution and crash after upgrades even if compilation and linkage succeed. It
is caused by semantic breaking (SemB) issues, such that APIs directly used by
users have identical signatures but inconsistent semantics across upgrades. To
strengthen compliance with SemVer rules, developers and users should be alerted
of such issues. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect them statically,
because semantic changes in the internal methods of APIs are difficult to
capture. Dynamic testing can confirmingly uncover some, but it is limited by
inadequate coverage.
  To detect SemB issues over compatible upgrades (Patch and Minor) by SemVer
rules, we conduct an empirical study on 180 SemB issues to understand the root
causes, inspired by which, we propose Sembid (Semantic Breaking Issue Detector)
to statically detect such issues of TPLs for developers and users. Since APIs
are directly used by users, Sembid detects and reports SemB issues based on
APIs. For a pair of APIs, Sembid walks through the call chains originating from
the API to locate breaking changes by measuring semantic diff. Then, Sembid
checks if the breaking changes can affect API's output along call chains. The
evaluation showed Sembid achieved 90.26% recall and 81.29% precision and
outperformed other API checkers on SemB API detection. We also revealed Sembid
detected over 3 times more SemB APIs with better coverage than unit tests, the
commonly used solution. Furthermore, we carried out an empirical study on

  Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting",2022-09-01T10:06:22Z,"Hui He, Qi Zhang, Kun Yi, Kaize Shi, Zhendong Niu, Longbing Cao","Due to the non-stationary nature, the distribution of real-world multivariate
time series (MTS) changes over time, which is known as distribution drift. Most
existing MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from distribution drift and
degrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address
distribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting
per the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in
MTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution
changes, especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose
a novel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model
the dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical
observations and future data in MTSs and infer the dependencies as a temporal
conditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel
temporal Hawkes attention mechanism represents temporal factors subsequently
fed into feed-forward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of
latent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically
adjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution
changes by leveraging a gated attention mechanism. Moreover, we introduce
conditional continuous normalization flow to transform the prior Gaussian to a
complex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the
temporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and
effectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further
illustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and
visualization in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00654v4

process of slow recombination. Models for this still have significant
uncertainties. The recombination cannot normally be observed in isolation,

because of the required very long time scales. The extended nebula around the
very late helium flash (VLTP) star V4334 Sgr provides a unique laboratory for
this kind of study. The sudden loss of the ionizing UV radiation after the VLTP
event has allowed the nebula to recombine free from other influences. More than
290 long slit spectra taken with FORS1/2 at the ESO VLT between 2007 and 2022
are used to follow the time evolution of lines of H, He, N, S, O, Ar. Hydrogen

  Subsequence Clustering Algorithm",2022-09-09T09:59:56Z,"Jonas Köhne, Lars Henning, Clemens Gühmann","This paper introduces an algorithm for the detection of change-points and the
identification of the corresponding subsequences in transient multivariate
time-series data (MTSD). The analysis of such data has become more and more
important due to the increase of availability in many industrial fields.
Labeling, sorting or filtering highly transient measurement data for training
condition based maintenance (CbM) models is cumbersome and error-prone. For
some applications it can be sufficient to filter measurements by simple
thresholds or finding change-points based on changes in mean value and
variation. But a robust diagnosis of a component within a component group for
example, which has a complex non-linear correlation between multiple sensor
values, a simple approach would not be feasible. No meaningful and coherent
measurement data which could be used for training a CbM model would emerge.
Therefore, we introduce an algorithm which uses a recurrent neural network
(RNN) based Autoencoder (AE) which is iteratively trained on incoming data. The
scoring function uses the reconstruction error and latent space information. A
model of the identified subsequence is saved and used for recognition of
repeating subsequences as well as fast offline clustering. For evaluation, we
propose a new similarity measure based on the curvature for a more intuitive

Hirsbrunner, Jorge Olivares Rodriguez, Lin Jiao, Lianyang Dong, Nadya Mason, Dale Van Harlingen, John Harter, Stephen Wilson, Taylor L. Hughes, Vidya Madhavan","The Fe-based superconductor Fe (Se,Te) combines non-trivial topology with
unconventional superconductivity and may be an ideal platform to realize exotic
states such as high-order topological corner modes and Majorana modes. Thin
films of Fe (Se,Te) are important for device fabrication, phase sensitive
transport measurements and for realizing proposals to engineer higher-order
modes. However, while bulk Fe (Se,Te) has been extensively studied with a
variety of techniques, the nature of the superconducting order parameter in the
monolayer limit has not yet been explored. In this work, we study monolayer
films of Fe (Se,Te) on Bi2Te3 with scanning tunneling spectroscopy and
Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). We discover that the monolayer Fe
(Se,Te)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures host a robust, multigap superconducting state
that strongly resembles the bulk. BQPI maps at the gap energies show a strong
spatial modulation, oriented 45 degrees to the Fe-Se bond direction. Analysis
of the phase-referenced quasiparticle interference signal reveals a
sign-changing s-wave order parameter similar to the bulk. Moreover, we observe
a unique pattern of sign changes in the BQPI signal which have not been
observed in the bulk. Our work establishes monolayer Fe (Se,Te)/Bi2Te3 as a
robust multi-band unconventional superconductor and sets the stage for
explorations of non-trivial topology in this highly-tunable system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04982v1
"A magnetic valve at L1 revealed in TESS photometry of the asynchronous
  polar BY Cam",2022-09-12T18:09:51Z,"Paul A. Mason, Colin Littlefield, Lorena C. Monroy, John F. Morales, Pasi Hakala, Peter Garnavich, Paula Szkody, Mark R. Kennedy, Gavin Ramsay, Simone Scaringi","We present TESS photometry of the asynchronous polar BY Cam, which undergoes
a beat-cycle between the 199.384-min white dwarf (WD) spin period and the
201.244-min orbital period. This results in changes in the flow of matter onto
the WD. The TESS light curve covers 92% of the beat cycle once and 71% of the
beat cycle twice. The strongest photometric signal, at 197.560-min, is ascribed
to a side-band period. During times of light-curve stability, the photometry
modulates at the spin frequency, supporting our WD spin-period identification.
Both one-pole and two-pole accretion configurations repeat from one beat cycle
to the next with clear and repeatable beat-phase dependent intensity
variations. To explain these, we propose the operation of a magnetic valve at
L1. The magnetic valve modulates the mass-transfer rate, as evidenced by a
factor of 5 variation in orbital-averaged intensity, over the course of the
beat cycle in a repeatable manner. The accretion stream threading distance from
the WD is also modulated at the beat-period, because of the variation of the WD
magnetic field with respect to the stream and because of changes in the mass
transfer rate due to the operation of the magnetic valve. Changes in the
threading distance result in significant shifts in the position of accreting
spots around the beat cycle. As a consequence, only the faintest photometric
minima allow for an accurate ephemeris determination. Three regions on the
white dwarf appear to receive most of the accretion flow, suggestive of a
complex WD magnetic field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05524v1
"INV-Flow2PoseNet: Light-Resistant Rigid Object Pose from Optical Flow of
  RGB-D Images using Images, Normals and Vertices",2022-09-14T11:40:00Z,"Torben Fetzer, Gerd Reis, Didier Stricker","This paper presents a novel architecture for simultaneous estimation of
highly accurate optical flows and rigid scene transformations for difficult
scenarios where the brightness assumption is violated by strong shading
changes. In the case of rotating objects or moving light sources, such as those
encountered for driving cars in the dark, the scene appearance often changes
significantly from one view to the next. Unfortunately, standard methods for
calculating optical flows or poses are based on the expectation that the
appearance of features in the scene remain constant between views. These
methods may fail frequently in the investigated cases. The presented method
fuses texture and geometry information by combining image, vertex and normal
data to compute an illumination-invariant optical flow. By using a
coarse-to-fine strategy, globally anchored optical flows are learned, reducing
the impact of erroneous shading-based pseudo-correspondences. Based on the
learned optical flows, a second architecture is proposed that predicts robust
rigid transformations from the warped vertex and normal maps. Particular
attention is payed to situations with strong rotations, which often cause such
shading changes. Therefore a 3-step procedure is proposed that profitably
exploits correlations between the normals and vertices. The method has been
evaluated on a newly created dataset containing both synthetic and real data
with strong rotations and shading effects. This data represents the typical use
case in 3D reconstruction, where the object often rotates in large steps
between the partial reconstructions. Additionally, we apply the method to the
well-known Kitti Odometry dataset. Even if, due to fulfillment of the brighness
assumption, this is not the typical use case of the method, the applicability
to standard situations and the relation to other methods is therefore
established.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06562v1

topic. It has been commonly accepted that the flight time of the polar flights
may increase during solar proton events because the flights have to change
their route to avoid the high-energy particles. However, apart from such
phenomenon, researches related to the flight time during space weather events
is very rare. Based on the analyses of 39 representative international air
routes around westerlies, it is found that 97.44% (94.87%) of the commercial
airplanes on the westbound (eastbound) air routes reveal shorter (longer)
flight time during solar proton events compared to those during quiet periods,
and the averaged magnitude of change in flight time is ~10 min or 0.21%-4.17%
of the total flight durations. Comparative investigations reassure the
certainty of such phenomenon that the directional differences in flight time
are still incontrovertible regardless of over-land routes (China-Europe) or
over-sea routes (China-Western America). Further analyses suggest that the
solar proton events associated atmospheric heating will change the flight
durations by weakening certain atmospheric circulations, such as the polar jet
stream. While the polar jet stream will not be obviously altered during solar
flares so that the directional differences in flight time are not found.
Besides the conventional space weather effects already known, this paper is the
first report that indicates a distinct new scenario of how the solar proton
events affect flight time. These analyses are also important for aviation since
our discoveries could help the airways optimize the air routes to save
passenger time costs, reduce fuel costs and even contribute to the global
warming issues.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07703v1

  modulators",2022-09-17T14:03:42Z,"Ipshita Datta, Andres Gil-Molina, Sang Hoon Chae, James Hone, Michal Lipson","Compact, high-speed electro-optic phase modulators play a vital role in
various large-scale applications including phased arrays, quantum and neural
networks, and optical communication links. Conventional phase modulators suffer
from a fundamental tradeoff between device length and optical loss that limits
their scaling capabilities. High-finesse ring resonators have been
traditionally used as compact intensity modulators, but their use for phase
modulation have been limited due to the high insertion loss associated with the
phase change. Here, we show that high-finesse resonators can achieve a strong
phase change with low insertion loss by simultaneous modulation of the real and
imaginary parts of the refractive index, to the same extent i.e. $\frac{\Delta
n}{\Delta k} \sim 1$. To implement this strategy, we utilize a hybrid platform
that combines a low-loss SiN ring resonator with electro-absorptive graphene
(Gr) and electro-refractive WSe$_2$. We achieve a phase modulation efficiency
($V_{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cdot L_{\frac{\pi}{2}}$) of 0.045 V $\cdot$ cm with an
insertion loss (IL$_{\frac{\pi}{2}}$) of 4.7 dB for a phase change of
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians, in a 25 $\mu$m long Gr-Al$_2$O$_3$-WSe$_2$ capacitor
embedded on a SiN ring of 50 $\mu$m radius. We find that our
Gr-Al$_2$O$_3$-WSe$_2$ capacitor can support an electro-optic bandwidth of 14.9

L_{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ of our SiN-2D platform is at least an order of magnitude
lower than that of electro-optic phase modulators based on silicon, III-V on

  Predictions",2022-09-18T01:52:16Z,"Lingjiao Chen, Zhihua Jin, Sabri Eyuboglu, Christopher Ré, Matei Zaharia, James Zou","Commercial ML APIs offered by providers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft
have dramatically simplified ML adoption in many applications. Numerous
companies and academics pay to use ML APIs for tasks such as object detection,
OCR and sentiment analysis. Different ML APIs tackling the same task can have
very heterogeneous performance. Moreover, the ML models underlying the APIs
also evolve over time. As ML APIs rapidly become a valuable marketplace and a
widespread way to consume machine learning, it is critical to systematically
study and compare different APIs with each other and to characterize how APIs
change over time. However, this topic is currently underexplored due to the
lack of data. In this paper, we present HAPI (History of APIs), a longitudinal
dataset of 1,761,417 instances of commercial ML API applications (involving
APIs from Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and other providers) across diverse
tasks including image tagging, speech recognition and text mining from 2020 to
2022. Each instance consists of a query input for an API (e.g., an image or
text) along with the API's output prediction/annotation and confidence scores.
HAPI is the first large-scale dataset of ML API usages and is a unique resource
for studying ML-as-a-service (MLaaS). As examples of the types of analyses that
HAPI enables, we show that ML APIs' performance change substantially over
time--several APIs' accuracies dropped on specific benchmark datasets. Even
when the API's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift
across different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. Such changes can
substantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ML API as a
component. We further use HAPI to study commercial APIs' performance
disparities across demographic subgroups over time. HAPI can stimulate more

  variations in radiotherapy",2022-09-20T09:56:53Z,"Oscar Pastor-Serrano, Steven Habraken, Mischa Hoogeman, Danny Lathouwers, Dennis Schaart, Yusuke Nomura, Lei Xing, Zoltán Perkó","In radiotherapy, the internal movement of organs between treatment sessions
causes errors in the final radiation dose delivery. Motion models can be used
to simulate motion patterns and assess anatomical robustness before delivery.
Traditionally, such models are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and
are either patient-specific (requiring several scans per patient) or
population-based, applying the same deformations to all patients. We present a
hybrid approach which, based on population data, allows to predict
patient-specific inter-fraction variations for an individual patient. We
propose a deep learning probabilistic framework that generates deformation
vector fields (DVFs) warping a patient's planning computed tomography (CT) into
possible patient-specific anatomies. This daily anatomy model (DAM) uses few
random variables capturing groups of correlated movements. Given a new planning
CT, DAM estimates the joint distribution over the variables, with each sample
from the distribution corresponding to a different deformation. We train our
model using dataset of 312 CT pairs from 38 prostate cancer patients. For 2
additional patients (22 CTs), we compute the contour overlap between real and
generated images, and compare the sampled and ground truth distributions of
volume and center of mass changes. With a DICE score of 0.86 and a distance
between prostate contours of 1.09 mm, DAM matches and improves upon PCA-based
models. The distribution overlap further indicates that DAM's sampled movements
match the range and frequency of clinically observed daily changes on repeat
CTs. Conditioned only on a planning CT and contours of a new patient without
any pre-processing, DAM can accurately predict CTs seen during following
treatment sessions, which can be used for anatomically robust treatment
planning and robustness evaluation against inter-fraction anatomical changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09583v1

H2O-CO2-CaCl2 and H2O-CO2-NaCl, an equation of state for the four-component
fluid system H2O-CO2-NaCl-CaCl2 is derived in terms of the Gibbs excess free
energy. A corresponding numerical thermodynamic model is build. The main part
of the numerical parameters of the model coincides with the corresponding
parameters of the ternary systems. The NaCl-CaCl2 interaction parameter was
obtained from the experimental liquidus of the salt mixture. Similar to the
thermodynamic models for H2O-CO2-CaCl2 and H2O-CO2-NaCl, the range of
applicability of the model is pressure 1-20 kbar and temperature from 500C to
1400C. The model makes it possible to predict the physicochemical properties of
the fluid involved in most processes of deep petrogenesis: the phase state of
the system (homogeneous or multiphase fluid, presence or absence of solid
salts), chemical activities of the components, densities of the fluid phases,
and concentrations of the components in the coexisting phases. The model was
used for a detailed study of the phase state and activity of water on the
H2O-CO2-salt sections when changing the ratio xNaCl/(xNaCl+xCaCl2) from 1 to 0.
Changes in the composition and density of coexisting fluid phases at a constant
activity of water and changes in the total composition of the system are
studied. A set of phase diagrams on sections H2O-NaCl-CaCl2 for different mole
fractions of CO2 is obtained. Pressure dependencies of the maximal activity of
water in the field of coexisting unmixable fluid phases are obtained for
several salt compositions of the system. Due to removal of restrictions
resulting from a smaller number of components in ternary systems, the
thermodynamic behavior of systems with a mixed composition of the salt is
significantly differ from the behavior of those with a single salt component.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10349v1

by calculating a set of evolutionary tracks of stars with an initial mass of 4
to 7 $M_\odot$, varying the initial rotation rate and metallicity, using the
stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).
Using Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP), a recently added functionality of MESA,
we obtained theoretical instability strip (IS) edges and linear periods for the
radial fundamental mode. Period-age, period-age-temperature, period-luminosity,
and period-luminosity-temperature relationships were derived for three rotation
rates and metallicities, showing a dependence on crossing number, position in
the IS, rotation, and metallicity. We calculated period change rates (PCRs)
based on the linear periods from RSP. We compared our models with literature
results using the Geneva code, and found large differences, as expected due to
the different implementations of rotation between codes. In addition, we
compared our theoretical PCRs with those measured in our recent work for Large
Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. We found good overall agreement, even though our
models do not reach the short-period regime exhibited by the empirical data.
Implementations of physical processes not yet included in our models, such as
pulsation-driven mass loss, an improved treatment of convection that may lead
to a better description of the instability strip edges, as well as
consideration of a wider initial mass range, could all help improve the
agreement with the observed PCRs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10609v2
Mixing and diffusion in protoplanetary disc chemistry,2022-09-25T14:35:46Z,"P. Woitke, A. M. Arabhavi, I. Kamp, W. -F. Thi","We develop a simple iterative scheme to include vertical turbulent mixing and
diffusion in ProDiMo thermo-chemical models for protoplanetary discs. The
models are carefully checked for convergence toward the time-independent
solution of the reaction-diffusion equations, as e.g. used in exoplanet
atmosphere models. A series of five T Tauri disc models is presented where we
vary the mixing parameter {\alpha} mix from 0 to 0.01 and take into account (a)
the radiative transfer feedback of the opacities of icy grains that are mixed
upward and (b) the feedback of the changing molecular abundances on the gas
temperature structure caused by exothermic reactions and increased line
heating/cooling. We see considerable changes of the molecular and ice
concentrations in the disc. The most abundant species (H2, CH4, CO, the neutral
atoms in higher layers, and the ices in the midplane) are transported both up
and down, and at the locations where these abundant chemicals finally
decompose, for example by photo processes, the release of reaction products has
important consequences for all other molecules. This generally creates a more
active chemistry, with a richer mixture of ionised, atomic, molecular and ice
species and new chemical pathways that are not relevant in the unmixed case. We
discuss the impact on three spectral observations caused by mixing and find
that (i) icy grains can reach the observable disc surface where they cause ice
absorption and emission features at IR to far-IR wavelengths, (ii) mixing
increases the concentrations of certain neutral molecules observable by mid-IR
spectroscopy, in particular OH, HCN and C2H2, and (iii) mixing can change the
optical appearance of CO in ALMA line images and channel maps, where strong
mixing would cause the CO molecules to populate the distant midplane.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12233v1

to exposed densities of $^{12}$C ions. The SEIKO FSP 1000 imaging microscope

  Scheduling",2022-10-04T04:20:20Z,"Yunsung Lee, Gyuseong Lee, Kwangrok Ryoo, Hyojun Go, Jihye Park, Seungryong Kim","There are two de facto standard architectures in recent computer vision:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Strong
inductive biases of convolutions help the model learn sample effectively, but
such strong biases also limit the upper bound of CNNs when sufficient data are
available. On the contrary, ViT is inferior to CNNs for small data but superior
for sufficient data. Recent approaches attempt to combine the strengths of
these two architectures. However, we show these approaches overlook that the
optimal inductive bias also changes according to the target data scale changes
by comparing various models' accuracy on subsets of sampled ImageNet at
different ratios. In addition, through Fourier analysis of feature maps, the
model's response patterns according to signal frequency changes, we observe
which inductive bias is advantageous for each data scale. The more
convolution-like inductive bias is included in the model, the smaller the data
scale is required where the ViT-like model outperforms the ResNet performance.
To obtain a model with flexible inductive bias on the data scale, we show
reparameterization can interpolate inductive bias between convolution and
self-attention. By adjusting the number of epochs the model stays in the
convolution, we show that reparameterization from convolution to self-attention
interpolates the Fourier analysis pattern between CNNs and ViTs. Adapting these
findings, we propose Progressive Reparameterization Scheduling (PRS), in which
reparameterization adjusts the required amount of convolution-like or
self-attention-like inductive bias per layer. For small-scale datasets, our PRS
performs reparameterization from convolution to self-attention linearly faster

CL-AGNs (redshift $z<0.5$) exhibiting spectral-type changes on a timescale of
$\sim 10$yr. Follow-up spectroscopy was conducted with the Lick Shane 3m and
Keck 10m telescopes for three of the objects. Detailed analysis of these
spectra enables us to arrive at the following two main results. (1) By
compiling a sample of 65 CL-AGNs with good measurements, we reinforce the
previous claim that CL-AGNs tend to be biased against both a high Eddington

causes changes in the geometrical and mechanical properties. Such changes are
strongly affected by the inter-fibre bonds, which are responsible for the
transfer of the hygro-mechanical response from one fibre to its neighbours in
the network, resulting in sheet-scale deformation. Most models developed in
literature assume perfect bonding between fibres. In the 3D reality, there is
some flexibility in the bond region, even for the perfectly bonded fibres,
because of the possibility of deformation gradients through the fibre
thickness. In earlier 2D idealizations, perfectly bonded fibres were assumed,
implying full kinematic constraint through the entire thickness of the sheet.
The purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of this assumption.
Using a homogenization approach, a random network of fibres is generated with
different coverages and modelled using finite elements. In order to understand
the role of bonding between fibres on the hygro-expansive behaviour of a
network, a bond model is developed. In this model, the fibres are modelled
using 2D regular bulk finite elements and the bonds are represented by
interfacial elements of finite stiffness, which are introduced between each
pair of fibres bonded in the network. These embedded interfacial elements form
a connection between two respective fibres, allowing relative displacements
between their mid-planes. The hygro-elastic response of networks obtained with
this bond model is investigated by varying the bond stiffness and the network
coverage under the application of mechanical loading and changes in moisture
content. Furthermore, the bond model is used to analyse the influence of
inter-fibre bonds on the anisotropic response of the paper fibre network.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05736v1
Free energy model of emotional valence in dual-process perceptions,2022-10-19T02:52:13Z,"Hideyoshi Yanagisawa, Xiaoxiang Wu, Kazutaka Ueda, Takeo Kato","An appropriate level of arousal induces positive emotions, and a high arousal
potential may provoke negative emotions. To explain the effect of arousal on
emotional valence, we propose a novel mathematical framework of arousal
potential variations in the dual process of human cognition: automatic and
controlled. A suitable mathematical formulation to explain the emotions in the
dual process is still absent. Our model associates free energy with arousal
potential and its variations to explain emotional valence. Decreasing and
increasing free energy consequently induce positive and negative emotions,
respectively. We formalize a transition from the automatic to the controlled
process in the dual process as a change of Bayesian prior. Further, we model
emotional valence using free energy increase (FI) when one tries changing one's
Bayesian prior and its reduction (FR) when one succeeds in recognizing the same
stimuli with a changed prior and define three emotions: ""interest,""
""confusion,"" and ""boredom"" using the variations. The results of our
mathematical analysis comparing various Gaussian model parameters reveals the
following: 1) prediction error (PR) increases FR (representing ""interest"") when
the first prior variance is greater than the second prior variance, 2) PR
decreases FR when the first prior variance is less than the second prior
variance, and 3) the distance between priors' means always increases FR. We
also discuss the association of the outcomes with emotions in the controlled
process. The proposed mathematical model provides a general framework for
predicting and controlling emotional valence in the dual process that varies

changing structures. A hierarchical approach takes advantage of the implicit
relationships in complex systems and localized context. The features in complex
systems may vary drastically in data distribution, capturing different aspects
from multiple data sources, and when put together provide a more complete view
of the system. In this paper, two datasets are considered, the 1st comprising
of system metrics from machines running on a cloud service, and the 2nd of
application metrics from a large-scale distributed software system with
inherent hierarchies and interconnections amongst its system nodes. Comparing
algorithms, across the changepoint based PELT algorithm, cognitive
learning-based Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithms, Support Vector Machines
and Conditional Random Fields provides a basis for proposing a Hierarchical
Global-Local Conditional Random Field approach to accurately capture anomalies
in complex systems across various features. Hierarchical algorithms can learn
both the intricacies of specific features, and utilize these in a global
abstracted representation to detect anomalous patterns robustly across
multi-source feature data and distributed systems. A graphical network analysis
on complex systems can further fine-tune datasets to mine relationships based
on available features, which can benefit hierarchical models. Furthermore,
hierarchical solutions can adapt well to changes at a localized level, learning
on new data and changing environments when parts of a system are over-hauled,

given: (i) The Green's function method, (ii) the generalized Bloch theorem, and
(iii) the supercell approach. First, the shell-resolved exchange constants are
calculated for the three Fe atoms within the unit cell of the freestanding
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayer. We find that the results between methods (i) and (ii)
are in good qualitative agreement and also with previously reported values. An
electric field of ${\cal E}= \pm 0.5$~V/{\AA} applied perpendicular to the
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene heterostructure leads to significant changes of the
exchange constants. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene is mainly dominated by the nearest neighbors,
resulting in a good quantitative agreement between methods (i) and (ii).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DMI is highly tunable by strain, stacking,
and electric field, leading to a large DMI comparable to that of
ferromagnetic/heavy metal (FM/HM) interfaces. The geometrical change and
hybridization effect explain the origin of the high tunability of the DMI at
the interface. The electric-field driven DMI obtained by method (iii) is in
qualitative agreement with the more accurate \textit{ab initio} method used in
approach (ii). However, the field-effect on the DMI is overestimated by method
(iii) by about 50\%. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy can also be
drastically changed by the application of compressive or tensile strain in the
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene heterostructure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15351v2
"Outlook for detecting the gravitational wave displacement and spin
  memory effects with current and future gravitational wave detectors",2022-10-28T16:56:08Z,"Alexander M. Grant, David A. Nichols","Gravitational wave memory effects arise from non-oscillatory components of
gravitational wave signals, and they are predictions of general relativity in
the nonlinear regime that have close connections to the asymptotic properties
of isolated gravitating systems. There are many types of memory effects that
have been studied in the literature. In this paper we focus on the
""displacement"" and ""spin"" memories, which are expected to be the largest of
these effects from sources such as the binary black hole mergers which have
already been detected by LIGO and Virgo. The displacement memory is a change in
the relative separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of
gravitational waves, whereas the spin memory is a portion of the change in
relative separation of observers with initial relative velocity. As both of
these effects are small, LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA can only detect memory effects
from individual events that are much louder (and thus rarer) than those that
have been detected so far. By combining data from multiple events, however,
these effects could be detected in a population of binary mergers. In this
paper, we present new forecasts for how long current and future detectors will
need to operate in order to measure these effects from populations of binary
black hole systems that are consistent with the populations inferred from the
detections from LIGO and Virgo's first three observing runs. We find that a
second-generation detector network of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA operating at the
O4 (""design"") sensitivity for 1.5 years and then operating at the O5 (""plus"")
sensitivity for an additional year can detect the displacement memory. For
Cosmic Explorer, we find that displacement memory could be detected for
individual loud events, and that the spin memory could be detected in a
population within 2 years of observation time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16266v4
TPHO: a time-dependent photoionisation model for AGN outflows,2022-10-28T18:00:29Z,"Daniele Rogantini, Missagh Mehdipour, Jelle Kaastra, Elisa Costantini, Anna Juráňová, Erin Kara","Outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered a promising candidate
for driving AGN feedback at large scales. However, without information on the
density of these outflows, we cannot determine how much kinetic power they are
imparting to the surrounding medium. Monitoring the response of the ionisation
state of the absorbing outflows to changes in the ionising continuum provides
the recombination timescale of the outflow, which is a function of the electron
density. We have developed a new self-consistent time-dependent photoionisation
model, TPHO, enabling the measurement of the plasma density through
time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy. The algorithm solves the full-time-dependent
energy and ionisation balance equations in a self-consistent fashion for all
the ionic species. The model can therefore reproduce the time-dependent
absorption spectrum of ionized outflows responding to changes in the ionizing
radiation of the AGN. We find that when the ionised gas is in a non-equilibrium
state its transmitted spectra are not accurately reproduced by standard
photoionisation models. Our simulations with the current X-ray grating
observations show that the spectral features identified as a
multiple-components warm absorber, might be in fact features of a time-changing
warm absorber and not distinctive components. The TPHO model facilitates
accurate photoionisation modelling in the presence of a variable ionising
source, thus providing constraints on the density and in turn the location of
the AGN outflows. Ascertaining these two parameters will provide important
insight into the role and impact of ionised outflows in AGN feedback.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16338v1

Transcriptome Complexities Across Eukaryotes,2022-11-04T16:13:36Z,"James E. Titus-McQuillan, Adalena V. Nanni, Lauren M. McIntyre, Rebekah L. Rogers","Genomic complexity is a growing field of evolution, with case studies for
comparative evolutionary analyses in model and emerging non-model systems.
Understanding complexity and the functional components of the genome is an
untapped wealth of knowledge ripe for exploration. With the ""remarkable lack of
correspondence"" between genome size and complexity, there needs to be a way to
quantify complexity across organisms. In this study we use a set of complexity
metrics that allow for evaluation of changes in complexity using TranD. We
ascertain if complexity is increasing or decreasing across transcriptomes and
at what structural level, as complexity is varied. We define three metrics --
TpG, EpT, and EpG in this study to quantify the complexity of the transcriptome
that encapsulate the dynamics of alternative splicing. Here we compare
complexity metrics across 1) whole genome annotations, 2) a filtered subset of
orthologs, and 3) novel genes to elucidate the impacts of ortholog and novel
genes in transcriptome analysis. We also derive a metric from Hong et al.,
2006, Effective Exon Number (EEN), to compare the distribution of exon sizes
within transcripts against random expectations of uniform exon placement. EEN
accounts for differences in exon size, which is important because novel genes
differences in complexity for orthologs and whole transcriptome analyses are
biased towards low complexity genes with few exons and few alternative
transcripts. With our metric analyses, we are able to implement changes in
complexity across diverse lineages with greater precision and accuracy than
previous cross-species comparisons under ortholog conditioning. These analyses
represent a step forward toward whole transcriptome analysis in the emerging
field of non-model evolutionary genomics, with key insights for evolutionary
inference of complexity changes on deep timescales across the tree of life. We
suggest a means to quantify biases generated in ortholog calling and correct
complexity analysis for lineage-specific effects. With these metrics, we
directly assay the quantitative properties of newly formed lineage-specific
genes as they lower complexity in transcriptomes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02546v1

starting as early as $\thicksim$ 10 seconds after gamma-ray trigger. The
earliest measurements of optical spectral shape have been made only much later,
typically on hour time scales, never starting less than a minute after trigger,
until now. Beginning only 58 seconds after the \emph{Swift} BAT triggerred on
GRB201015A, we observed a sharp rise in optical flux to a peak, followed by a
power law temporal decay, $\propto t^{-0.81 \pm 0.03}$. Flux was measured
simultaneously in three optical bands, g\p, r\p, and i\p, using our Burst
Simultaneous Three-channel Imager (BSTI) on the NUTTelA-TAO telescope. Our data
during the decay show strong colour evolution from red to blue, with a change
in the optical log slope of $+0.72 \pm 0.14$; during this time the X-ray log
slope remained constant. We did not find evidence for a two-component jet
structure or a transition from reverse to forward shock or a prompt emission
component that would explain this change in slope. We find that the majority of
the optical spectral slope evolution is consistent with a monotonic decay of
extinction, evidence of dust destruction. Assuming a constant source spectral
slope and an SMC-like extinction curve, we derive a change in the local
extinction $A_\mathrm{v}^\mathrm{local}$ from $\thicksim$0.8 mag to 0.3 mag in

linearly with $T$ from the onset of superconductivity to the crystal melting
temperature, indicative of a Planckian dissipation life time
$\tau_{\hbar}\simeq \hbar /(k_B T)$. At the same time, the optical conductivity
ceases to be of Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change of the
underlying dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity
unaffected. We use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled,
densely entangled metals to study DC thermo-electrical transport and the
optical conductivities of the local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic
strange metal in the presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to
compare with experiment. We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at
low temperatures for a range of lattice strengths and wavevectors, even as it
transitions between different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential
the optical conductivity evolves with increasing temperature from a Drude form
to a bad-metal characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC
transport, similar to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak and
its temperature evolution can be understood as a consequence of Umklapp
hydrodynamics: hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch modes in the presence of a
lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent metal is realized instead
where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in transport. In this regime
the thermal diffusivity can be explained by Planckian dissipation originating
in universal microscopic chaos, similar to holographic metals with strong
homogeneous momentum relaxation. The charge diffusivity does not submit to this
chaos explanation, even though the continuing linear-in-$T$ DC resistivity
saturates to an apparent universal slope, numerically equal to a Planckian

Assessing Neural Network Robustness via Adversarial Pivotal Tuning,2022-11-17T18:54:35Z,"Peter Ebert Christensen, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson, Andrea Dittadi, Serge Belongie, Sagie Benaim","The robustness of image classifiers is essential to their deployment in the
real world. The ability to assess this resilience to manipulations or
deviations from the training data is thus crucial. These modifications have
traditionally consisted of minimal changes that still manage to fool
classifiers, and modern approaches are increasingly robust to them. Semantic
manipulations that modify elements of an image in meaningful ways have thus
gained traction for this purpose. However, they have primarily been limited to
style, color, or attribute changes. While expressive, these manipulations do
not make use of the full capabilities of a pretrained generative model. In this
work, we aim to bridge this gap. We show how a pretrained image generator can
be used to semantically manipulate images in a detailed, diverse, and
photorealistic way while still preserving the class of the original image.
Inspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method
called Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). Given an image, APT first finds a
pivot latent space input that reconstructs the image using a pretrained
generator. It then adjusts the generator's weights to create small yet semantic
manipulations in order to fool a pretrained classifier. APT preserves the full
expressive editing capabilities of the generative model. We demonstrate that
APT is capable of a wide range of class-preserving semantic image manipulations
that fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. Finally, we show that
classifiers that are robust to other benchmarks are not robust to APT
manipulations and suggest a method to improve them. Code available at:

both ground and aerial vehicles. Such a formulation of the path planning
problem requires a linear objective function and constraints, limiting the
fidelity of the the tracking of vehicle states. One such parameter is the state
of charge of the battery used to power the vehicle. Accurate battery state
estimation requires nonlinear differential equations to be solved. This state
estimation is important in path planning to ensure flyable paths, however when
using MILPs to formulate the path planning problem these nonlinear equations
cannot be implemented. Poor accuracy in battery estimation during the path
planning runs the risk of the planned path being feasible by the estimation
model but in reality will deplete the battery to a critical level. To the end
of higher accuracy battery estimation within a MILP, we present here a simple
linear battery model which predicts the change in state-of-charge (SOC) of a
battery given a power draw and duration. This model accounts for changes in
battery voltage due to applied electrical load and changes in battery SOC. The
battery model is presented and then tested against alternate battery models in
numerical and in experimental tests. Further, the effect the proposed linear
model has over a simpler SOC estimation on the time-to-solve a resource

non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations to estimate the coronal

helicity, in both photospheric fluxes and coronal content, that persist for a
few hours after eruptions, but no clear changes, notably in relative helicity,
for confined events; (2) significant increases in the twist of photospheric
fields in eruptive events, with twist uncertainties too large in confined
events to constrain twist changes (and lower overall twist in confined events);
and (3) on longer time scales (event time +12 hours), replenishment of free

then in 2017 partially re-ignited into a repeat flaring state, unusual for an
AGN. Our \emph{Swift} observations since 2013 allow us to characterise the
accretion-generated emission and its reprocessing in the central engine of a
changing-look AGN. The X-ray and UV variability amplitudes are higher than
those typically observed in `steady-state' AGN at similar moderate accretion
rates; instead, the variability is similar to that of highly accreting AGN. The
unusually strong X-ray to UV correlation suggests that the UV-emitting region
is directly illuminated by X-ray outbursts. We find evidence that the X-rays
are reprocessed by two UV components, with the dominant one at $\sim$3 days and
a faint additional reprocessor at near-zero lag. However, we exclude a
significant contribution from diffuse broad line region continuum, known to
contribute for bona-fide AGN. A near-zero lag is expected for a standard
`lamp-post' disk reprocessing model with a driving continuum source near the
black hole. That the overall UV response is dominated by the $\sim$3-day lagged
component suggests a complicated reprocessing geometry, with most of the UV
continuum not produced in a compact disk, as also found in recent studies of
NGC 5548 and NGC 4151. Nonetheless, the observed flares display characteristic

Energy conservation drives the expansion of the universe,2022-11-25T14:54:51Z,J. M. Greben,"We develop a cosmological theory in which the evolution of the universe is
controlled by the cosmological constant and dominated by the associated vacuum
energy. The universe starts as a classical de Sitter space with an infinite
effective vacuum energy density, which decreases subsequently like 1/t^3. The
corresponding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor also decreases over
time, showing that the common assumption that it describes the expansion of the
universe is incorrect and should be abandoned. Instead, the (cubic) expansion
of the universe is needed to satisfy energy conservation. Once the vacuum
energy density has decreased to the Planck level the first elementary particles
can be created through a direct conversion of vacuum energy. After this epoch,
the enormous kinetic energy enables a quick magnification of the number of
particles through ordinary production processes in tandem with the expansion of
space.
  The dominance of vacuum (dark) energy is supposed to persist into later
epochs, which enables a perturbative treatment of matter and radiation leading
to linear equations, which replace the usual FRW equations. The presence of
matter changes the vacuum metric, inducing a secondary matter term which might
explain the phenomenon of dark matter. Together with a similar induced
radiation term, it provides a possible explanation for the recent acceleration
of the expansion of the universe. The theory unifies particle physics and
cosmology by expressing particle physics units in terms of the gravitational
and cosmological constant. This relationship also explains a number of
numerical coincidences which have long puzzled physicists.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01269v2
Importance of high-frequency bands for thermal dust removal in ECHO,2022-12-06T10:18:05Z,"Aparajita Sen, Soumen Basak, Tuhin Ghosh, Debabrata Adak, Srijita Sinha","The Indian Consortium of Cosmologists has proposed a cosmic microwave

the thermal dust and the Galactic synchrotron. To facilitate the adequate
subtraction of thermal dust, the instrument design of ECHO has included nine
dust-dominated high-frequency bands over the frequency range of 220-850 GHz. In
this work, we closely reexamine the utility of the high-frequency ECHO bands in
foreground subtraction using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination component
separation method. We consider three dust models: a physical dust model, a dust
spectral energy distribution (SED) with a single modified black body (MBB)
emission law and a multilayer dust model with frequency-frequency
decorrelation. We consider eleven ECHO bands in the 28-190 GHz range as our
baseline configuration and investigate the changes in the level foreground and
noise residuals as subsequent dust-dominated high-frequency bands are added. We
find that adding the high-frequency bands leads to a consistent decrease in the
level of residual foreground and noise, and the sensitivity of r measurement
improves. Most of the reduction in both residual levels and enhancement in the
sensitivity is achieved in the 28-600 GHz frequency range. Negligible change in

trajectory data that allows an effective visualization and characterization of
city-wide traffic dynamics. With the advance of sensor, mobile, and Internet of
Things (IoT) technologies, vehicle and passenger trajectories are being
increasingly collected on a massive scale and are becoming a critical source of
insight into traffic pattern and traveller behaviour. To leverage such
trajectory data to better understand traffic dynamics in a large-scale urban
network, this study develops a trajectory-based network traffic analysis method
that converts individual trajectory data into a sequence of graphs that evolve
over time (known as dynamic graphs or time-evolving graphs) and analyses
network-wide traffic patterns in terms of a compact and informative
graph-representation of aggregated traffic flows. First, we partition the
entire network into a set of cells based on the spatial distribution of data
points in individual trajectories, where the cells represent spatial regions
between which aggregated traffic flows can be measured. Next, dynamic flows of
moving objects are represented as a time-evolving graph, where regions are
graph vertices and flows between them are treated as weighted directed edges.
Given a fixed set of vertices, edges can be inserted or removed at every time
step depending on the presence of traffic flows between two regions at a given
time window. Once a dynamic graph is built, we apply graph mining algorithms to
detect change-points in time, which represent time points where the graph
exhibits significant changes in its overall structure and, thus, correspond to
change-points in city-wide mobility pattern throughout the day (e.g., global
transition points between peak and off-peak periods).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02927v1

  binaries",2022-12-19T16:35:38Z,"A. Simaz Bunzel, F. García, J. A. Combi, F. Fortin, S. Chaty","An important stage in the evolution of massive binaries is the formation of a
compact object in the system. It is believed that in some cases a momentum kick
is imparted to the newly born object, changing the orbital parameters of the
binary, such as eccentricity and orbital period, and even acquiring an
asynchronous orbit between its components. In this situation, tides play a
central role in the evolution of these binaries. In this work we aim to study
how the orbital parameters of a massive binary change after the formation of a
compact object when the stellar spin of the non-degenerate companion is not
aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We used MESA, which we modified to
be able to evolve binaries with different values of the inclination between the
orbital planes before and just after the formation of the compact object. These
modifications to the equations solved by the MESA code are extended to the case
of non-solid body rotation. We find that the impact of having different initial
inclinations is mostly present in the evolution towards an equilibrium state
that is independent of the inclination. If the binary separation is small
enough such that the interaction happens when the star is burning hydrogen in
its core, this state is reached before the beginning of a mass-transfer phase,
while for a wider binary not all conditions characterizing the equilibrium are
met. These findings show that including the inclination in the equations of
tidal evolution to a binary after a kick is imparted onto a newly born compact
object changes the evolution of some parameters, such as the eccentricity and
the spin period of the star, depending on how large this inclination is.
Moreover, these results can be used to match the properties of observed X-ray
binaries to estimate the strength of the momentum kick.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09599v1

study how the characteristics of this ""depletion zone"" relate to the particle
Stokes number (St), particle diameter, and the Reynolds number of the turbulent
flow. A collision-induced modulation factor $\gamma_{c}$ is defined to
represent the degree of RDF depletion due to collisions-coagulation. In the
region where $\gamma_c(r)$ is a quasi-power-law, the corresponding power-law
exponent $\tilde{c}_1$ only depends weakly on $St$. The overall trend of
$\tilde{c}_1$ with respect to $St$ is similar to that of the classical
power-law exponent $c_{1}$ appearing in the RDF of non-colliding particles,
i.e., the exponent increase at small $St$, peak around $St \approx 0.7$, and
decrease thereafter. The same qualitative trend is also observed for the
limiting values of $\gamma_c$ at $r\to d$. A complementary investigation on the
Stokes number trend of the full RDF in the depletion zone is conducted. The
slope of RDF appears constant for $St\ll1$ but is changing when $St$ is getting
large. The position where the RDF starts to decrease is found to be
$St$-dependent. The depletion zone is insensitive to the flow Reynolds number
and $\gamma_c$ of different $Re_{\lambda}$ overlap. With changing particle
diameter $d$, the reduction of RDF occurs at scales that shift accordingly and
always starts at around $2.4d-3d$. The shape of $\gamma_c(r)$ is independent of
changes in $d$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13665v3
"Mid-infrared spectra of the shocked Murchison CM chondrite: Comparison
  with astronomical observations of dust in debris disks",2022-12-29T10:07:56Z,"A. Morlok, C. Koike, N. Tomioka, I. Mann, K. Tomoeka","We present laboratory mid-infrared transmission/absorption spectra obtained
from matrix of the hydrated Murchison CM meteorite experimentally shocked at
peak pressures of 10 to 49 GPa, and compare them to astronomical observations
of circumstellar dust in different stages of the formation of planetary
systems. The laboratory spectra of the Murchison samples exhibit characteristic
changes in the infrared features. A weakly shocked sample (shocked at 10 GPa)
shows almost no changes from the unshocked sample dominated by hydrous silicate
(serpentine). Moderately shocked samples (21 to 34 GPa) have typical serpentine
features gradually replaced by bands of amorphous material and olivine with
increasing shock pressure. A strongly shocked sample (36 GPa) shows major
changes due to decomposition of the serpentine and due to devolatilization. A
shock melted sample (49 GPa) shows features of olivine recrystallized from
melted material. The spectra of highly shocked Murchison samples (36 and 49
GPa) are similar to those of dust in the debris disks of HD113766 and HD69830,
and the transitional disk of HD100546. The moderately shocked samples (21 to 34
GPa) exhibit spectra similar to those of dust in the debris disks of Beta
Pictoris and BD+20307, and the transitional disk of GM Aur. An average of the
spectra of all Murchison samples (0 to 49 GPa) has a similarity to the spectrum
of the older protoplanetary disk of SU Auriga. In the gas-rich transitional and
protoplanetary disks, the abundances of amorphous silicates and gases have
widely been considered to be a primary property. However, our study suggests
that impact processing may play a significant role in generating secondary
amorphous silicates and gases in those disks. Infrared spectra of the shocked
Murchison samples are also suggesting that the comets also contain shocked
Murchison-like material.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14248v1
Anisotropy of Cosmic Rays and Chaotic Trajectories in the Heliosphere,2022-12-09T20:08:45Z,"Vanessa López-Barquero, Paolo Desiati","As cosmic rays (CRs) propagate in the Galaxy, they can be affected by
magnetic structures that temporarily trap them and cause their trajectories to
display chaotic behavior, therefore modifying the simple diffusion scenario.
When CRs arrive at the Earth, they do so anisotropically. These chaotic effects
can be a fundamental contributor to this anisotropy. Accordingly, this requires
a comprehensive description of chaos in trapping conditions since assessing
their repercussions on the CR arrival directions is necessary. This study
utilizes a new method described in L\'opez-Barquero and Desiati (2021) to
characterize chaotic trajectories in bound systems. This method is based on the
Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), a quantity that determines the levels of
chaos based on the trajectories' divergence rate. The FTLE is useful since it
adapts to trapping conditions in magnetic structures or even propagating media
changes. Here, we explore the effects that chaos and trapping can have on the
TeV CR anisotropy. Concretely, we apply this method to study the behavior of
CRs entering the heliosphere. Specifically, how the distinct heliospheric
structures and CR impinging directions from the ISM can affect chaos levels.
The heliosphere has an intrinsic directionality that affects CRs differently
depending on where they enter it. This feature causes preferential directions
from which particles tend to be more chaotic than others. This eventually
translates into changes in the arrival maps which are not uniformly
distributed. Instead, we expect sectors in the map to change separately from
others, creating a time variation that could be detected. Consequently, this
result points to the idea that time-variability in the maps is essential to
understanding the CR anisotropy's overall processes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10065v1

Modelling of a cyclist's power for time trials on a velodrome,2022-01-18T07:35:10Z,"Len Bos, Michael A. Slawinski, Raphaël A. Slawinski, Theodore Stanoev","We formulate a phenomenological model to study the power applied by a cyclist
on a velodrome\, -- \,for individual timetrials\, -- \,taking into account the
straights, circular arcs, connecting transition curves and banking. The
dissipative forces we consider are air resistance, rolling resistance, lateral
friction and drivetrain resistance. Also, power can be used to increase the
kinetic and gravitational potential energy. Herein, to model a steady ride\, --
\,as expected for individual timetrials\, -- \,we assume a constant
centre-of-mass speed, while allowing the cadence and power to vary during a
lap. Hence, the kinetic energy is constant and the only mechanical energy whose
change we need to consider is the increase of gravitational potential energy
due to raising the centre of mass upon exiting each curve. The effect of
dissipative forces is examined at each point of the lap; the effect of
conservative forces is examined as an average. The latter is a small\, --
\,albeit not negligible\, -- \,part of the total power, and its inclusion
within a model is a novelty presented herein. It increases the model's
empirical adequacy.
  Following derivations and justifications of expressions that constitute this
mathematical model, we present a numerical example. We show that the cadence
and power vary slightly during a steady ride. In other words, a constant
centre-of-mass speed entails nearly constant cadence and power, as expected for
a steady ride and as supported by measurements. Also, we examine changes in the
required power due to changes of various quantities, such as air density at a
velodrome, laptime and several others, as well as the model sensitivity to
input errors. Furthermore, we examine the effects on the required power of
slight and gradual changes in speed, which are pertinent to individual time
trials.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06788v14

  of self-propelled inertial disks",2022-01-19T14:34:51Z,"Soumen De Karmakar, Rajaraman Ganesh","Phase diagram of the phenomenon of motility induced phase separation (MIPS)
for a collection of self-propelled interacting disks is explored using Langevin
dynamics simulation with particular emphasis on disk wall softness and the
range of interaction amongst disks. We bring out important changes in the MIPS
phase diagram both due to softness and inertia of the disks. Specifically, we
show that overdamped softer disks phase separate while MIPS becomes possible
only for harder disks in the inertial limit. Unlike most of the earlier studies
on MIPS which consider hard-core disks, our findings may be directly applicable
to soft active matter for a range of biological systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07623v1
Adiabatic Continuity of the Spinful Quantum Hall States,2022-01-19T22:32:32Z,"Koji Kudo, Yasuhiro Hatsugai","By using the extended Hubbard model of anyons, we numerically demonstrate the
adiabatic deformation of the spinful quantum Hall (QH) states by transmutation
of statistical fluxes. While the ground state is always spin-polarized in a
series of $\nu=1$ integer QH system, the adiabatic continuity between the
singlet QH states at $\nu=2$ and $\nu=2/5$ is confirmed. These results are
consistent with the composite fermion theory with spin. The many-body Chern
number of the ground state multiplet works as an adiabatic invariant and also
explains the wild change of the topological degeneracy during the evolution.
The generalized Streda formula of spinful systems is justified.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07893v1

Dispersive Sum Rules in AdS$_2$,2022-03-21T17:47:40Z,"Waltraut Knop, Dalimil Mazac","Dispersion relations for S-matrices and CFT correlators translate UV
consistency into bounds on IR observables. In this note, we construct
dispersive sum rules for 1D CFTs. We use them to prove bounds on
higher-derivative couplings in weakly-coupled non-gravitational EFTs in
AdS$_2$. At the leading order in the bulk-point limit, the bounds agree with
the flat-space result. We compute the leading universal effect of finite AdS
radius on the bounds. Along the way, we give an explicit formula for anomalous

Far from equilibrium relaxation in the weak coupling limit,2022-03-22T11:54:54Z,"Ran Yaacoby, Oren Raz, Gianluca Teza","It is commonly assumed that a large system, weakly coupled to a thermal
environment through its boundaries, relaxes quasistatically towards the new
equilibrium even when the temperature of the environment changes abruptly. Here
we show how this intuitive picture can break down for discrete energy systems,
even in the case of infinitely weak coupling. We provide an example in the
Ising chain, showing how the interaction among degrees of freedom can create
corrugated energy landscapes that are responsible for far-from-equilibrium and
allow anomalous relaxation effects to survive infinitely weak couplings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11644v2
CNNs and Transformers Perceive Hybrid Images Similar to Humans,2022-03-19T21:37:07Z,Ali Borji,"Hybrid images is a technique to generate images with two interpretations that

enhance the numerical solution by applying a two-point refinement strategy.

attributed to a slow increase in the area of atomic contact as the interface
changes under pressure. This is however very difficult to quantify as surfaces
have roughness at all length scales, and friction is not always proportional to
the contact area. Here, we show that plastic flow of surface irregularities
