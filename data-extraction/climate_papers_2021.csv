Climate Change Conspiracy Theories on Social Media,2021-07-07T15:56:44Z,"Aman Tyagi, Kathleen M. Carley","One of the critical emerging challenges in climate change communication is
the prevalence of conspiracy theories. This paper discusses some of the major
conspiracy theories related to climate change found in a large Twitter corpus.
We use a state-of-the-art stance detection method to find whether conspiracy
theories are more popular among Disbelievers or Believers of climate change. We
then analyze which conspiracy theory is more popular than the others and how
popularity changes with climate change belief. We find that Disbelievers of
climate change are overwhelmingly responsible for sharing messages with
conspiracy theory-related keywords, and not all conspiracy theories are equally
shared. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for climate change
communication.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03318v1

between the number of tweets about climate change and major climate events; the
common topics people discuss climate change; and the trend of sentiment. Our

A Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework: A Spatial Approach,2021-08-22T15:50:55Z,"Claudia Cáceres, Yan Li, Brian Hilton","Climate change is affecting every known society, especially for small farmers
in Low-Income Countries because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality
patterns, and known temperature ranges. To build climate change resilient
communities among rural farmers, the first step is to understand the impact of
climate change on the population. This paper proposes a Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment Framework (CCVAF) to assess climate change
vulnerabilities among rural farmers. The CCVAF framework uses information and
communication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among
rural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household
level indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application
named THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change
is affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the
THRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes
to not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment
but also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a
class of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09762v1
"What shapes climate change perceptions in Africa? A random forest
  approach",2021-05-17T14:03:14Z,"Juan B Gonzalez, Alfonso Sanchez","Climate change perceptions are fundamental for adaptation and environmental
policy support. Although Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to
climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived
in the continent. Using random forest methodology, we analyse Afrobarometer
data (N = 45,732), joint with climatic data, to explore what shapes climate
change perceptions in Africa. We include 5 different dimensions of climate
change perceptions: awareness, belief in its human cause, risk perception, need
to stop it and self-efficacy. Results indicate that perceived agriculture
conditions are crucial for perceiving climate change. Country-level factors and
long-term changes in local weather conditions are among the most important
predictors. Moreover, education level, access to information, poverty,
authoritarian values, and trust in institutions shape individual climate change
perceptions. Demographic effects -- including religion -- seem negligible.
These findings suggest policymakers and environmental communicators how to
frame climate change in Africa to raise awareness, gather public support and
induce adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07867v1
"A large-scale bibliometric analysis of global climate change research
  between 2001 and 2018",2021-07-17T10:28:28Z,"Hui-Zhen Fu, Ludo Waltman","Global climate change is attracting widespread scientific, political, and
public attention owing to the involvement of international initiatives such as
the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We
present a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000
climate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change
is studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of
scientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical
distribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis,
we identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences,
paleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate
policy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time
period, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the
climate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient
energy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production
between developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands,
and national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research
interests and concerns of researchers in different countries. Our study can be
used by researchers and policy makers to reflect on the directions in which
climate change research is developing and discuss priorities for future
research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08214v1
"NLP for Climate Policy: Creating a Knowledge Platform for Holistic and
  Effective Climate Action",2021-05-12T12:30:02Z,"Pradip Swarnakar, Ashutosh Modi","Climate change is a burning issue of our time, with the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the United Nations demanding global climate
action. Realizing the urgency, in 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed an
agreement committing to taking voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the scale, magnitude, and climate action processes vary globally,
especially between developed and developing countries. Therefore, from
parliament to social media, the debates and discussions on climate change
gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design and
implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to
pool the worldwide dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and
unstructured data sources.
  The paper thematically discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in
climate policy research and contribute to society's good at large. In
particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate
policy using automated content analysis. We investigate the opinions
(sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards climate policy in the second
methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs towards
pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate
Knowledge Graph.
  The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform
would help in the formulation of a holistic climate policy and effective
climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate the policy actors'
varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to
effective climate action because policymakers can make informed decisions by
looking at the diverse public opinion on a comprehensive platform.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05621v1

Graph-based Local Climate Classification in Iran,2021-10-18T11:50:37Z,"Neda Akrami, Koorush Ziarati, Soumyabrata Dev","In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method to classify the
regions with similar climate in a local area. We refer our proposed method as
Graph Partition Based Method (GPBM). Our proposed method attempts to overcome
the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art methods in the literature. It
has no limit on the number of variables that can be used and also preserves the
nature of climate data. To illustrate the capability of our proposed algorithm,
we benchmark its performance with other state-of-the-art climate classification
techniques. The climate data is collected from 24 synoptic stations in Fars
province in southern Iran. The data includes seven climate variables stored as
time series from 1951 to 2017. Our results exhibit that our proposed method
performs a more realistic climate classification with less computational time.
It can save more information during the climate classification process and is
therefore efficient in further data analysis. Furthermore, using our method, we
can introduce seasonal graphs to better investigate seasonal climate changes.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first graph-based
climate classification system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09209v1
"Climate Change Valuation Adjustment (CCVA) using parameterized climate
  change impacts",2021-02-21T21:42:36Z,"Chris Kenyon, Mourad Berrahoui","We introduce Climate Change Valuation Adjustment (CCVA) to capture climate
change impacts on CVA+FVA that are currently invisible assuming typical market
practice. To discuss such impacts on CVA+FVA from changes to instantaneous
hazard rates we introduce a flexible and expressive parameterization to capture
the path of this impact to climate change endpoints, and transient transition
effects. Finally we provide quantification of examples of typical interest
where there is risk of economic stress from sea level change up to 2101, and
from transformations of business models. We find that even with the slowest
possible uniform approach to a climate change impact in 2101 there can still be
significant CVA+FVA impacts on interest rate swaps of 20 years or more
maturity. Transformation effects on CVA+FVA are strongly dependent on timing
and duration of business model transformation. Using a parameterized approach
enables discussion with stakeholders of economic impacts on CVA+FVA, whatever
the details behind the climate impact.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10691v3

"Quantifying uncertainty about global and regional economic impacts of
  climate change",2021-02-25T18:04:43Z,"Jenny Bjordal, Trude Storelvmo, Anthony A. Smith Jr","The economic impacts of climate change are highly uncertain. Two of the most
important uncertainties are the sensitivity of the climate system and the
so-called damage functions, which relate climate change to economic damages and
benefits. Despite broad awareness of these uncertainties, it is unclear which
of them is most important, both on the global as well as the regional level.
Here we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with
vastly different climate sensitivities, and find that uncertainty in both
climate sensitivity and economic damage per degree of warming are of similar
importance for the global economic impact. Increasing the climate sensitivity
or the sensitivity of the damage function both increases the economic damages
globally. Yet, at the country-level the effect varies depending on the initial
temperature as well as how much the country warms. Our findings emphasise the
importance of including these uncertainties in estimates of future economic
impacts, as they both are vital for the resulting impacts and thus policy
implications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13051v1

we examine a CBR system (PBI-CBR) designed to aid sustainable dairy farming by

climate changes, PBI-CBRs historical cases become less useful in predicting
future grass growth. Hence, we extend PBI-CBR using data augmentation, to
specifically handle disruptive climate events, using a counterfactual method
(from XAI). Study 1 shows that historical, extreme climate-events (climate
outlier cases) tend to be used by PBI-CBR to predict grass growth during
climate disrupted periods. Study 2 shows that synthetic outliers, generated as
counterfactuals on a outlier-boundary, improve the predictive accuracy of
PBICBR, during the drought of 2018. This study also shows that an

"Analysis of the Evolution of Parametric Drivers of High-End Sea-Level
  Hazards",2021-06-11T01:50:16Z,"Alana Hough, Tony E. Wong","Climate models are critical tools for developing strategies to manage the
risks posed by sea-level rise to coastal communities. While these models are
necessary for understanding climate risks, there is a level of uncertainty
inherent in each parameter in the models. This model parametric uncertainty
leads to uncertainty in future climate risks. Consequently, there is a need to
understand how those parameter uncertainties impact our assessment of future
climate risks and the efficacy of strategies to manage them. Here, we use
random forests to examine the parametric drivers of future climate risk and how
the relative importances of those drivers change over time. We find that the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and a factor that scales the effect of aerosols
on radiative forcing are consistently the most important climate model
parametric uncertainties throughout the 2020 to 2150 interval for both low and
high radiative forcing scenarios. The near-term hazards of high-end sea-level
rise are driven primarily by thermal expansion, while the longer-term hazards
are associated with mass loss from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Our
results highlight the practical importance of considering time-evolving
parametric uncertainties when developing strategies to manage future climate

is described as a Poisson process driven by aggregate CO2 emissions. The
severity of disasters is described using a generalized Pareto distribution
driven by the trend in regional real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

"How are cities pledging net zero? A computational approach to analyzing
  subnational climate strategies",2021-12-14T21:33:39Z,"Siddharth Sachdeva, Angel Hsu, Ian French, Elwin Lim","Cities have become primary actors on climate change and are increasingly
setting goals aimed at net-zero emissions. The rapid proliferation of
subnational governments ""racing to zero"" emissions and articulating their own
climate mitigation plans warrants closer examination to understand how these
actors intend to meet these goals. The scattered, incomplete and heterogeneous
nature of city climate policy documents, however, has made their systemic
analysis challenging. We analyze 318 climate action documents from cities that
have pledged net-zero targets or joined a transnational climate initiative with
this goal using machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP)
techniques. We use these approaches to accomplish two primary goals: 1)
determine text patterns that predict ""ambitious"" net-zero targets, where we
define an ambitious target as one that encompasses a subnational government's
economy-wide emissions; and 2) perform a sectoral analysis to identify patterns
and trade-offs in climate action themes (i.e., land-use, industry, buildings,
etc.). We find that cities that have defined ambitious climate actions tend to
emphasize quantitative metrics and specific high-emitting sectors in their
plans, supported by mentions of governance and citizen participation. Cities
predominantly emphasize energy-related actions in their plans, particularly in
the buildings, transport and heating sectors, but often at the expense of other
sectors, including land-use and climate impacts. The method presented in this
paper provides a replicable, scalable approach to analyzing climate action
plans and a first step towards facilitating cross-city learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11207v1

However, the application of PINNs in climate modeling has so far been mostly
limited to deterministic models. We leverage a novel method that combines
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), a classic technique for uncertainty

Demographic perspectives in research on global environmental change,2021-02-01T10:38:54Z,Raya Muttarak,"Human population is at the centre of research on global environmental change.
On the one hand, population dynamics influence the environment and the global

health and wellbeing of the population is already being affected by climate
change. The knowledge on population dynamics and population heterogeneity thus
is fundamental in improving our understanding of how population size,
composition and distribution influence global environmental change and how
these changes affect subgroups of population differentially by demographic
characteristics and spatial distribution. Existing theoretical concepts and
methodological tools in demography can be readily applied to the study of
population and global environmental change. In the past couple of decades,
demographic research has enriched climate change research both in the analysis
of the impact of population dynamics on the global climate system as well as
the impact of climate change on human population. What is missing in the
literature is the study that investigates how global environmental change
affect current and future demographic processes and consequently population
trends. If global environmental change does influence fertility, mortality and
migration, the three key demographic components underlying population change,
population estimates and forecast need to adjust from the climate feedback in

estimates of economic damages -- when these economists otherwise assume that
human economic productivity will be an order of magnitude higher than today --
contrast strongly with predictions made by scientists of significantly reduced
human habitability from climate change. Nonetheless, the coupled economic and
climate models used to make such predictions have been influential in the
international climate change debate and policy prescriptions. Here we review
the empirical work done by economists and show that it severely underestimates
damages from climate change by committing several methodological errors,
including neglecting tipping points, and assuming that economic sectors not
exposed to the weather are insulated from climate change. Most fundamentally,
the influential Integrated Assessment Model DICE is shown to be incapable of
generating an economic collapse, regardless of the level of damages. Given
these flaws, economists' empirical estimates of economic damages from global
warming should be rejected as unscientific, and models that have been
calibrated to them, such as DICE, should not be used to evaluate economic risks
from climate change, or in the development of policy to attenuate damages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07847v1

Reconciling high resolution climate datasets using KrigR,2021-08-09T11:42:40Z,"Richard Davy, Erik Kusch","There is an increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution climate
data for the wide community of researchers interested in climate change and its
consequences. Currently, there is a large mismatch between the spatial
resolutions of global climate model and reanalysis datasets (at best around
0.25o and 0.1o respectively) and the resolutions needed by many end-users of
these datasets, which are typically on the scale of 30 arcseconds (~900m). This
need for improved spatial resolution in climate datasets has motivated several
groups to statistically downscale various combinations of observational or
reanalysis datasets. However, the variety of downscaling methods and inputs
used makes it difficult to reconcile the resultant differences between these
high-resolution datasets. Here we make use of the KrigR R-package to
statistically downscale the world-leading ERA5(-Land) reanalysis data using
kriging. We show that kriging can accurately recover spatial heterogeneity of
climate data given strong relationships with co-variates; that by preserving
the uncertainty associated with the statistical downscaling, one can
investigate and account for confidence in high-resolution climate data; and
that the statistical uncertainty provided by KrigR can explain much of the
difference between widely used high resolution climate datasets (CHELSA,
TerraClimate, and WorldClim2) depending on variable, timescale, and region.
This demonstrates the advantages of using KrigR to generate customized high

Uncertainty in Climate Science: Not Cause for Inaction,2021-08-19T16:45:43Z,"Juan M. Restrepo, Michael E. Mann","Using observational data and an elementary rigorous statistical fact it is
easily shown that the distribution of Earth's climate is non-stationary.
Examination of records of hundreds of local Industrial Era temperature
histories in the Northern Hemisphere were used to show this fact.
Statistically, the mean of the ensemble has been rising during the Industrial
Era. All of this confirms what climate scientists already know. The issue of
predictions under uncertainties was tackled as well: a simple balance model was
tuned to track an ensemble of climate records. Stochastic parametrizations were
created to capture natural and anthropogenic CO2 forcings. The resulting
stochastic model was then tested against historical data and then used to make
future predictions. This exercise confirmed as well climate science attribution
to significant global warming during the Industrial Era to anthropogenic
activities. The variability of the model due to uncertainties is simply not
large enough to obfuscate a clear rise in the mean temperature in the
Industrial Era. Further, even if the variance of the natural CO2 contribution
is greatly increased artificially (in the model), the fluctuations cannot
account for the current change in the historical mean.
  These outcomes weaken the factual validity of the US administration,
2016-2020, claims that there are too many uncertainties in climate and climate
science to make climate predictions, and further that contemporary reports of
floods, extreme weather, even a rising global mean temperature are simply
manifestations of a climate that always fluctuates within a nature-derived

The climate in climate economics,2021-07-13T15:23:13Z,"Doris Folini, Felix Kübler, Aleksandra Malova, Simon Scheidegger","To analyze climate change mitigation strategies, economists rely on
simplified climate models - climate emulators. We propose a generic and
transparent calibration and evaluation strategy for these climate emulators
that is based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5). We
demonstrate that the appropriate choice of the free model parameters can be of
key relevance for the predicted social cost of carbon. We propose to use four
different test cases: two tests to separately calibrate and evaluate the carbon
cycle and temperature response, a test to quantify the transient climate
response, and a final test to evaluate the performance for scenarios close to
those arising from economic models. We re-calibrate the climate part of the
widely used DICE-2016: the multi-model mean as well as extreme, but still
permissible climate sensitivities and carbon cycle responses. We demonstrate
that the functional form of the climate emulator of the DICE-2016 model is fit
for purpose, despite its simplicity, but its carbon cycle and temperature
equations are miscalibrated. We examine the importance of the calibration for
the social cost of carbon in the context of a partial equilibrium setting where
interest rates are exogenous, as well as the simple general equilibrium setting
from DICE-2016. We find that the model uncertainty from different consistent
calibrations of the climate system can change the social cost of carbon by a
factor of four if one assumes a quadratic damage function. When calibrated to
the multi-model mean, our model predicts similar values for the social cost of
carbon as the original DICE-2016, but with a strongly reduced sensitivity to
the discount rate and about one degree less long-term warming. The social cost
of carbon in DICE-2016 is oversensitive to the discount rate, leading to
extreme comparative statics responses to changes in preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06162v3

challenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change and the
evolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems
are studied successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation
Theory (LDT). A great potential exists for applying LDT to problems relevant
for geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. In particular, LDT allows
for understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations of
climatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to
low-frequency, large scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT
can be used in conjunction with so-called rare events algorithms to explore
rarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special dynamical
configurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to
improve our understanding of high-impact weather and climate events.
Furthermore, LDT provides powerful tools for evaluating the probability of
noise-induced transitions between competing metastable states of the climate
system or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our
understanding of the global stability properties of the climate system and of
its predictability of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this

Episodic deluges in simulated hothouse climates,2021-11-04T19:11:07Z,"Jacob Seeley, Robin Wordsworth","Earth's distant past and potentially its future include extremely warm
""hothouse"" climate states, but little is known about how the atmosphere behaves
in such states. One distinguishing characteristic of hothouse climates is that
they feature lower-tropospheric radiative heating, rather than cooling, due to
the closing of the water vapor infrared window regions. Previous work has
suggested that this could lead to temperature inversions and significant
changes in cloud cover, but no previous modeling of the hothouse regime has
resolved convective-scale turbulent air motions and cloud cover directly, thus
leaving many questions about hothouse radiative heating unanswered. Here, we
conduct simulations that explicitly resolve convection and find that
lower-tropospheric radiative heating in hothouse climates causes the hydrologic
cycle to shift from a quasi-steady regime to a ""relaxation oscillator"" regime,
in which precipitation occurs in short and intense outbursts separated by
multi-day dry spells. The transition to the oscillatory regime is accompanied
by strongly enhanced local precipitation fluxes, a significant increase in
cloud cover, and a transiently positive (unstable) climate feedback parameter.
Our results indicate that hothouse climates may feature a novel form of
""temporal"" convective self-organization, with implications for both cloud

of the need to explore a wide range of alternative scenarios and other sources
of uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner, climate models can only
take us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially
when attempting to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand
long and numerous simulations in order to accurately represent their changing

GAN modeling Fall-Winter behavior and the other Spring-Summer. Our GANs are
trained to produce spatiotemporal samples: 32 days of precipitation over a

set of related performance metrics based upon KL divergence, and find the
generated samples to be nearly as well matched to the test data as the
validation data is to test. We also find the generated samples to accurately
estimate the mean number of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day

responsible for irreversible entropy production in the climate system. Focusing
on material processes, an entropy budget for the climate system is derived
which accounts for the multi-phase nature of the hydrological cycle. The
entropy budget facilitates a heat-engine perspective of atmospheric
circulations that has been used to propose theories for convective updraft

automatically exploring the parameter space more broadly. In Bayesian learning,
it is natural to exploit the seasonal cycle, which has large amplitude,

suffers from quasi-periodic heterogeneity in variance. However, this issue has
barely been overlooked in climate research. A contribution of this article is
that we propose a joint model of quantile regression and variability. By
accounting appropriately for the heterogeneity in these types of data, our
analysis reveals that daily maximum temperature is warming by 0.21 Celsius per
decade and daily minimum temperature by 0.13 Celsius per decade. However, our
modeling also shows nuanced patterns of climate change depends on location,

responsible for the water level variations in Lake Toba, North Sumatra
Province, Indonesia. According to several studies carried out from 1993 to
2020, changes in the water level were associated with climate variability,
climate change, and human activities. Furthermore, these studies stated that
reduced rainfall during the rainy season due to the El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the continuous increase in the maximum and average
temperatures were some of the effects of climate change in the Lake Toba
catchment area. Additionally, human interventions such as industrial
activities, population growth, and damage to the surrounding environment of the
Lake Toba watershed had significant impacts in terms of decreasing the water
level. However, these studies were unable to determine the factor that had the
most significant effect, although studies on other lakes worldwide have shown
these factors are the main causes of fluctuations or decreases in water levels.
A simulation study of Lake Toba's water balance showed the possibility of
having a water surplus until the mid-twenty-first century. The input discharge
was predicted to be greater than the output; therefore, Lake Toba could be
optimized without affecting the future water level. However, the climate
projections depicted a different situation, with scenarios predicting the
possibility of extreme climate anomalies, demonstrating drier climatic
conditions in the future. This review concludes that it is necessary to conduct
an in-depth, comprehensive, and systematic study to identify the most dominant
factor among the three that is causing the decrease in the Lake Toba water
level and to describe the future projected water level.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08918v1

significance and periodic ice jam flooding from both rivers is an important
feature of its current ecology. Past studies have debated whether a change in
ice jam flood (IJF) frequency on the Peace River has recently occurred, and
what factors might be driving any perceived changes. This study contributes to
this debate by addressing two questions: (1) what factors are most predictive
of Peace River IJFs, and (2) how might climate change impact IJF frequency?
This work starts with a physically-based conceptual model of the necessary
conditions for a large Peace River IJF, and the factors that indicate whether
those conditions are met. Logistic regression is applied to the historical
flood record to determine which combination of hydroclimatic and riverine
factors best predict IJFs and the uncertainty in those relationships given the
available data. Winter precipitation and temperature are most predictive of
Peace River IJFs, while freeze-up elevation contains little predictive power
and is not closely related to IJF occurrence. The best logistic regression
model is forced with downscaled climate change scenarios from multiple climate
models to project IJF frequency for a variety of plausible futures. Parametric
uncertainty in the best logistic regression model is propagated into the
projections using a parametric bootstrap to sample many plausible statistical
models. Although there is variability across emissions scenarios and climate
models, all projections indicate that the frequency of Peace River IJFs is
likely to decrease substantially in the coming decades, and that average
waiting times between future IJFs will likely surpass recent experience.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13282v1

"Modeling of Pan Evaporation Based on the Development of Machine Learning
  Methods",2021-10-10T10:06:16Z,Mustafa Al-Mukhtar,"For effective planning and management of water resources and implementation
of the related strategies, it is important to ensure proper estimation of
evaporation losses, especially in regions that are prone to drought. Changes in
climatic factors, such as changes in temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours,
humidity, and solar radiation can have a significant impact on the evaporation
process. As such, evaporation is a highly non-linear, non-stationary process,
and can be difficult to be modeled based on climatic factors, especially in
different agro-climatic conditions. The aim of this study, therefore, is to

Towards Representation Learning for Atmospheric Dynamics,2021-09-19T07:43:30Z,"Sebastian Hoffmann, Christian Lessig","The prediction of future climate scenarios under anthropogenic forcing is
critical to understand climate change and to assess the impact of potentially
counter-acting technologies. Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this
prediction rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but
often subtle influences. For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the
climate system, no well established metric exists and visual inspection is
currently still often used in practice. However, this ""eyeball metric"" cannot
be used for machine learning where an algorithmic description is required.
Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis
for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel,
self-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for
atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on
a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of
a randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the
wind field from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn
important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from
these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by
using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity
and divergence. Our upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its
statistics a high resolution reference closely and it significantly outperform
the state-of-the-art based on mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is
unsupervised, only requires a temporal sequence of fields, and uses a simple
auxiliary task, it has the potential to be of utility in a wide range of
applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09076v2

change will affect heavy precipitation patterns. Dividing the globe into
homogeneous sub-regions should improve the modelling of heavy precipitation by
inferring common regional distributional parameters. In addition, in the
detection and attribution (D&A) field, biases due to model errors in global
climate models (GCMs) should be considered to attribute the anthropogenic

algorithm that, compared to classical regional frequency analysis (RFA)
techniques, is covariate-free and accounts for dependence. It is based on a new
non-parametric dissimilarity that combines both the RFA constraint and the
pairwise dependence. We derive asymptotic properties of our dissimilarity
estimator, and we interpret it for generalised extreme value distributed pairs.
  As a D&A application, we cluster annual daily precipitation maxima of 16 GCMs

consistent subregions identified for all GCMs. This improves the spatial
clusters coherence and outperforms methods either based on margins or on

  drivers, and some cautious forecasts",2021-01-13T16:30:32Z,Frank Stefani,"The two main drivers of climate change on sub-Milankovic time scales are
re-assessed by means of a multiple regression analysis. Evaluating linear
combinations of the logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the
geomagnetic aa-index as a proxy for solar activity, we reproduce the sea
surface temperature (HadSST) since the middle of the 19th century with an
adjusted $R^2$ value of around 87 per cent for a climate sensitivity (of TCR
type) in the range of 0.6 K until 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$. The solution of
the regression is quite sensitive: when including data from the last decade,
the simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Ni\~no on one side and low aa-values
on the other side lead to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high
climate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If those later data are excluded, the
regression leads to a significantly higher weight of the aa-index and a
correspondingly lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility
of such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and
satellite-borne measurements. We argue that a further decade of data collection
will be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high
sensitivity values. Based on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary
synchronization of the solar dynamo, we make a first attempt to predict the
aa-index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO$_2$
scenarios. Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear
CO$_2$ increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1
K until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent

adaptive capacity at local level and how it can be enhanced. We use path
analysis technique using the lavaan package in RStudio to empirically test the
role of information. We find that information is a direct and significant
contributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. However, even with
exponential growth in use of technology, particularly information and
communication technologies (ICTs), small farmers still lack access to
information which hinders their capacity to respond to weather and climate
risks. Thus, understanding the mechanism that can facilitate exchange and use
of information by the farming community more effectively is important. We take
an ensemble view of ICTs operationalized using ICT ecosystem and find
significant interlinkages between information, technology and the ICT ecosystem
that facilitate learning and information exchange and therefore contribute to
enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and building resilience to climate shocks.
We find that ICT ecosystem does facilitate access to information and also

  rotated Maximum Covariance Analysis",2021-05-10T18:58:08Z,"Niclas Rieger, Álvaro Corral, Estrella Olmedo, Antonio Turiel","A proper description of ocean-atmosphere interactions is key for a correct
understanding of climate evolution. The interplay among the different variables
acting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long
spatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions, those teleconnections
occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the
understanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by
standard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance
Analysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows to extract common dominant
patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the
non-physical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple
correlations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we
propose an extension, complex rotated MCA, to address both limitations. We
transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal
decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase
signals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints,
leading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an
example of application, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature
and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal
and spatial interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the
seasonal cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, (v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic

impact of rainfall and storm tide. However, existing approaches lack the
ability to model the combined effect of these flood mechanisms. Thus, to
increase flood resilience, modeling techniques to improve understanding and
prediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To
address this need, this study presents a modeling system for assessing the
combined flood risk to coastal cities under changing climate conditions that
leverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable of resolving urban
drainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated
in quantifying the future impact on transportation infrastructure within
Norfolk, Virginia USA. A series of combined storms events are modeled for
current (2020) and projected future (2070) climate conditions. Results show
that pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation
network compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070,
however, tidal flooding will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even
nuisance flooding expected to happen daily due to SLR. In 2070, nuisance
flooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is more
than two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled
model was compared with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method
to assess the difference resulting from the more complex modeling presented.
Results show that the bathtub method overestimated the flooded area near the
shoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070,

"Probing the timescale dependency of local and global variations in
  surface air temperature from climate simulations and reconstructions of the
  last millennia",2021-01-31T14:08:42Z,"Beatrice Ellerhoff, Kira Rehfeld","Earth's climate can be understood as a dynamical system that changes due to
external forcing and internal couplings. Essential climate variables, such as
surface air temperature, describe this dynamics. Our current interglacial, the
Holocene (11,700 yr ago to today), has been characterized by small variations
in global mean temperature prior to anthropogenic warming. However, the
mechanisms and spatiotemporal patterns of fluctuations around this mean, called
temperature variability, are poorly understood despite their socio-economic
relevance. Here, we examine discrepancies between temperature variability from
model simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions by categorizing the scaling
behavior of local and global surface air temperature on the timescale of years
to centuries. To this end, we contrast power spectral densities (PSD) and their
power-law scaling using simulated and observation-based temperature series of
the last 6000 yr. We further introduce the spectral gain to disentangle the
externally forced and internally generated variability as a function of
timescale. It is based on our estimate of the joint PSD of radiative forcing,
which exhibits a scale break around the period of 7 yr. We find that local
temperature series from paleoclimate reconstructions show a different scaling
behavior than simulated ones, with a tendency towards stronger persistence
(i.e., correlation between successive values within a time series) on periods
of 10 to 200 yr. Conversely, the PSD and spectral gain of global mean
temperature are consistent across data sets. Our results point to the
limitation of climate models to fully represent local temperature statistics
over decades to centuries. By highlighting the key characteristics of
temperature variability, we pave a way to better constrain possible changes in
temperature variability with global warming and assess future climate risks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00458v2

This virus infects birds, humans, horses, and other mammals, and its
transmission cycle occurs in urban and rural areas. Climate conditions have
direct and indirect impacts on vector abundance and virus dynamics within the
mosquito. The significance of environmental variables as drivers in WNV
epidemiology is increasing under the current climate change scenario. In this
study, we used a machine learning algorithm to model WNV distributions in South
America. Our model evaluated eight environmental variables (type of biome,
annual temperature, seasonality of temperature, daytime temperature variation,
thermal amplitude, seasonality of precipitation, annual rainfall, and
elevation) for their contribution to the occurrence of WNV since its
introduction in South America (2004). Our results showed that environmental
variables can directly alter the occurrence of WNV, with lower precipitation
and higher temperatures associated with increased virus incidence. High-risk
areas may be modified in the coming years, becoming more evident with high
greenhouse gas emission levels. Countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay will be
greatly affected, drastically changing their current WNV distribution. Several
Brazilian areas will also increase the likelihood of presenting WNV, mainly in
the Northeast and Midwest regions and the Pantanal biome. The Galapagos Islands
will also probably increase their geographic range suitable for WNV occurrence.

Arctic have been spatially and temporally sparse. We propose a measurement
framework that would instrument existing sea ice buoys with strain gauges. This
measurement framework uses a Bayesian inference approach to infer ice loads
acting on the buoy from a set of strain gauge measurements. To test our
framework, strain measurements were collected from an experiment where a buoy
was frozen into ice that was subsequently compressed to simulate convergent sea

"Nonstationary seasonal model for daily mean temperature distribution
  bridging bulk and tails",2021-10-19T15:18:00Z,"Mitchell Krock, Julie Bessac, Michael L. Stein, Adam H. Monahan","In traditional extreme value analysis, the bulk of the data is ignored, and
only the tails of the distribution are used for inference. Extreme observations
are specified as values that exceed a threshold or as maximum values over
distinct blocks of time, and subsequent estimation procedures are motivated by
asymptotic theory for extremes of random processes. For environmental data,
nonstationary behavior in the bulk of the distribution, such as seasonality or
climate change, will also be observed in the tails. To accurately model such
nonstationarity, it seems natural to use the entire dataset rather than just
the most extreme values. It is also common to observe different types of
nonstationarity in each tail of a distribution. Most work on extremes only
focuses on one tail of a distribution, but for temperature, both tails are of
interest. This paper builds on a recently proposed parametric model for the
entire probability distribution that has flexible behavior in both tails. We
apply an extension of this model to historical records of daily mean
temperature at several locations across the United States with different
climates and local conditions. We highlight the ability of the method to
quantify changes in the bulk and tails across the year over the past decades

largest point sources of methane. We present a high-resolution 0.1deg x 0.1deg
bottom-up gridded emission inventory for methane emissions from coal mines in
India and Australia, which are among the top five coal-producing countries in
2018. The aim is to reduce the uncertainty in local coal mine methane emissions
and to improve the spatial localization to support monitoring and mitigation of
these emissions. For India, we improve the spatial allocation of the emissions
by identifying the exact location of surface and underground coal mines and we
use a tier-2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology to
estimate the emissions from each coal mine using country-specific emission
factors. For Australia, we estimate the emission for each coal mine by
distributing the state-level reported total emissions using proxies of coal
production and the coal basin-specific gas content profile of underground
mines. Comparison of our total coal mine methane emission from India with
existing global inventories showed our estimates are about a factor 3 lower,
but well within the range of the national Indian estimate reported to the
United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). For both
countries, the new spatial distribution of the emissions shows a large
difference from the global inventories. Our improved emissions dataset will be
useful for air quality or climate modeling and while assessing the satellite
methane observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10317v2

can provide information regarding climate variability and climate change.
Changes in diurnal temperature range can have implications for hydrology, human
health and ecology, among others. Yet, the statistical literature on modelling

distribution of diurnal temperature range using the five-parameter lambda (FPL)
distribution. Additionally, in order to model diurnal temperature range with
explanatory variables, we propose a distributional quantile regression model
that combines quantile regression with marginal modelling using the FPL
distribution. Inference is performed using the method of quantiles. The models
are fitted to 30 years of daily observations of diurnal temperature range from
112 weather stations in the southern part of Norway. The flexible FPL
distribution shows great promise as a model for diurnal temperature range, and
performs well against competing models. The distributional quantile regression

"Shallow geothermal energy potential for heating and cooling of buildings
  with regeneration under climate change scenarios",2021-12-02T12:55:56Z,"Alina Walch, Xiang Li, Jonathan Chambers, Nahid Mohajeri, Selin Yilmaz, Martin Patel, Jean-Louis Scartezzini","Shallow ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) are a promising technology for
contributing to the decarbonisation of the energy sector. In heating-dominated
climates, the combined use of GSHPs for both heating and cooling increases
their technical potential, defined as the maximum energy that can be exchanged
with the ground, as the re-injection of excess heat from space cooling leads to
a seasonal regeneration of the ground. This paper proposes a new approach to
quantify the technical potential of GSHPs, accounting for effects of seasonal
regeneration, and to estimate the useful energy to supply building energy
demands at regional scale. The useful energy is obtained for direct heat
exchange and for district heating and cooling (DHC) under several scenarios for
climate change and market penetration levels of cooling systems. The case study
in western Switzerland suggests that seasonal regeneration allows for annual
maximum heat extraction densities above 300 kWh/m$^2$ at heat injection
densities above 330 kWh/m$^2$. Results also show that GSHPs may cover up to 55%
of heating demand while covering 57% of service-sector cooling demand for
individual GSHPs in 2050, which increases to around 85% with DHC. The

emissions of CO2 by 2050. However, the window of opportunity is closing fast.
Geoengineering as the intentional and large-scale manipulation of the
environment and in particular the climate is increasingly discussed as a
complement to ongoing mitigation efforts. As a particular geoengineering
approach, space-based geoengineering blocks or dissipates a fraction of
incoming sunlight via many occulting membranes, located close to the Sun-Earth
Lagrange 1 point. However, the mass of the proposed sunshades, around
$10^7$-$10^8$ tons, and their associated cost render them about $10^3$ times
more costly than terrestrial alternatives. In this article, we propose a novel
sunshade concept, which is between $10^2$ to $10^3$ times lighter than the
lightest existing sunshade concepts. This is achieved via a net zero-radiation
pressure design, based on the use of diffractive metamaterials, removing one of
the major constraints to reducing sunshade mass. The whole sunshade system has
a total mass of approximately $6.2 \times 10^5$ tons and its deployment
requires between $10^2$ to $10^3$ annual launches during a ten-year period. The
achieved cost reduction might render space-based geoengineering competitive to

large amounts of problematic air pollutants, including Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).
Despite the importance of limiting GHG emissions to mitigate climate change,
detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of GHG and
other air pollutants is difficult to obtain. Existing models for surface-level
air pollution rely on extensive land-use datasets which are often locally
restricted and temporally static. This work proposes a deep learning approach
for the prediction of ambient air pollution that only relies on remote sensing

satellite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric column density air pollution
measurements enables the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case
NO$_2$) to high spatial resolution (up to $\sim$10m) at arbitrary locations and
adds a temporal component to these estimates. The proposed model performs with
high accuracy when evaluated against air quality measurements from ground

standard assumption of planetary symmetry about the equator. The dynamics of
separate Northern and Southern Hemisphere ice caps are coupled to an equation
representing the annual global mean surface temperature. The system has a
discontinuous switching mechanism based on mass balance principles for the
Northern Hemisphere ice sheet. We show the associated Filippov system admits a
unique nonsmooth and attracting limit cycle that represents the cycling between
glacial and interglacial states. Due to the vastly different time scales

in a two-dimensional (2D) configuration to simulate the clouds and circulation
on tidally locked aqua-planets. We find that the substellar area is covered by
deep convective clouds, the nightside is dominated by low-level clouds, and
these two are linked by a global-scale Walker circulation. We further find that
a uniform surface warming causes the substellar cloud width to decrease, but a
reduction in day-night surface temperature contrast or an increase in longwave
radiative cooling rate causes the substellar cloud width to increase. These
relationships can be roughly interpreted based on simple thermodynamic
theories. Comparing the results between CRM and global 3D general circulation
model (GCM), we find that they show qualitatively consistent results, including
the Walker circulation, the substellar clouds, and the responses of the
substellar ascending area and strength to changes in surface temperature or in
its zonal contrast. But, large quantitative differences exist, such as the
magnitude of cloud water path, the cloud width, and their responses to external
forcings. These results increase our confidence in using GCMs for modeling
exoplanetary climates, although large quantitative uncertainties should always
exist. Future work is required to use 3D CRM(s) with realistic radiative
transfer and with the Coriolis force to examine the clouds and climate of
tidally locked planets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04143v2
"A multispecies pseudoadiabat for simulating condensable-rich exoplanet
  atmospheres",2021-08-29T20:02:52Z,"R. J. Graham, Tim Lichtenberg, Ryan Boukrouche, Ray Pierrehumbert","Central stages in the evolution of rocky, potentially habitable planets may
play out under atmospheric conditions with a large inventory of non-dilute
condensable components. Variations in condensate retention and accompanying
changes in local lapse rate may substantially affect planetary climate and
surface conditions, but there is currently no general theory to effectively
describe such atmospheres. In this article, expanding on the work by Li et al.
(2018), we generalize the single-component moist pseudoadiabat derivation in
Pierrehumbert (2010) to allow for multiple condensing components of arbitrary
diluteness and retained condensate fraction. The introduction of a freely
tunable retained condensate fraction allows for a flexible, self-consistent
treatment of atmospheres with non-dilute condensable components. To test the
pseudoadiabat's capabilities for simulating a diverse range of climates, we
apply the formula to planetary atmospheres with compositions, surface
pressures, and temperatures representing important stages with condensable-rich
atmospheres in the evolution of terrestrial planets: a magma ocean planet in a
runaway greenhouse state; a post-impact, late veneer-analogue planet with a
complex atmospheric composition; and an Archean Earth-like planet near the
outer edge of the classical circumstellar habitable zone. We find that
variations in the retention of multiple non-dilute condensable species can
significantly affect the lapse rate and in turn outgoing radiation and the
spectral signatures of planetary atmospheres. The presented formulation allows
for a more comprehensive treatment of the climate evolution of rocky exoplanets
and early Earth analogues.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12902v1
Towards fully ab initio simulation of atmospheric aerosol nucleation,2021-07-10T09:43:38Z,"Shuai Jiang, Yi-Rong Liu, Teng Huang, Ya-Juan Feng, Chun-Yu Wang, Zhong-Quan Wang, Wei Huang","Atmospheric aerosol nucleation contributes to more than half of cloud
condensation nuclei globally. The emissions, properties and concentrations of
atmospheric aerosols or aerosol precursors could respond significantly to
climate change. Despite the importance for climate, the detailed nucleation
mechanisms are still poorly understood. The ultimate goal of theoretical
understanding aerosol nucleation is to simulate nucleation in ambient
condition, hindered by lack of accurate reactive force field. Here we propose
the reactive force field for nucleation systems with good size scalability
based on deep neural network. The huge computational costs from direct
molecular dynamics in ambient conditions are surmounted by bridging the
simulation in the limited box with cluster kinetics, facilitating the aerosol
nucleation simulation to be fully ab initio. We found that the acid-base
formation rates previously based on hard sphere collision rate constants tend
to be underestimated up to several times. These findings show that the widely
recognized acid-base nucleation observed in the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor
Droplets) chamber experiments, pristine and polluted environments should be
revisited to considering the contribution of collision enhancement. Besides,
the framework here is transferable to other nucleation systems, potentially
boosting the nucleation parameterizations accuracy generally to effectively

Simulating cloud-aerosol interactions made by ship emissions,2021-11-09T19:02:32Z,"Lekha Patel, Lyndsay Shand","Satellite imagery can detect temporary cloud trails or ship tracks formed
from aerosols emitted from large ships traversing our oceans, a phenomenon that
global climate models cannot directly reproduce. Ship tracks are observable
examples of marine cloud brightening, a potential solar climate intervention
that shows promise in helping combat climate change. Whether or not a ship's
emission path visibly impacts the clouds above and how long a ship track
visibly persists largely depends on the exhaust type and properties of the
boundary layer with which it mixes. In order to be able to statistically infer
the longevity of ship-emitted aerosols and characterize atmospheric conditions
under which they form, a first step is to simulate, with mathematical surrogate
model rather than an expensive physical model, the path of these cloud-aerosol
interactions with parameters that are inferable from imagery. This will allow
us to compare when/where we would expect to ship tracks to be visible,
independent of atmospheric conditions, with what is actually observed from
satellite imagery to be able to infer under what atmospheric conditions do ship
tracks form. In this paper, we will discuss an approach to stochastically
simulate the behavior of ship induced aerosols parcels within naturally
generated clouds. Our method can use wind fields and potentially relevant
atmospheric variables to determine the approximate movement and behavior of the
cloud-aerosol tracks, and uses a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to
model the persistence behavior of cloud-aerosol paths. This SDE incorporates
both a drift and diffusion term which describes the movement of aerosol parcels
via wind and their diffusivity through the atmosphere, respectively. We
successfully demonstrate our proposed approach with an example using simulated
wind fields and ship paths.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05356v1

fits linear dynamical models to data. While the DMD usually approximates
non-linear terms in the true dynamics as a linear system with random noise, we

January 2021. To link plot scale transpiration with earth observations, we
utilized Sentinel-2 and local meteorological data. Within a machine learning

relevance of Sentinel-2 data for the data-driven upscaling of ecosystem fluxes

significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds 0.70 area

projections is evaluated from three perspectives: large-scale climate scenarios
downscaled values, and mean decadal changes. 15 GCMs unanimously project an
increasing trend in the temperature for the study region. Also, uncertainty in
the projections for the summer months is greater than projection uncertainty
for other months. The mean absolute surface temperature increase for the three

S. We show that climate induced trends in primary productivity are highly
heterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well documented poleward
migration of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring
upwelling winds in the region between ca. 30{\deg} and 34{\deg} S, and to their
intensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced slight increases in
sea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease in
surface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30{\deg}
S, significant increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced
Chlorophyll-a concentration are observed in the nearshore. We show that this
increased in upwelling driven coastal productivity is probably produced by the
increased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over
the past two decades north of 30{\deg} S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE
are inducing contrasting trends in oceanographic conditions and primary
productivity, which can have far-reaching consequences for coastal pelagic and
benthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11698v1

the agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable
methods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of
technology in agriculture has the potential to improve food production and food

the linguistic signature of these conversations. Prior work has shown that
contentious content and structure can be a predictor for this task, however,

linguistic and conversational characteristics and user factors, and
incorporating them to build interpretable models. We demonstrate that such

Environmental migration? An overview of the literature,2021-12-28T11:29:03Z,"Maria Cipollina, Luca De Benedictis, Elisa Scibè","The literature on the relationship between environmental factors such as
climatic changes and natural hazards and human mobility (both internal and

highlight the role of climate changes as a driver of migratory flows, while
others underline how this impact is mediated by geographical, economic and the
features of the environmental shock. This paper attempts to map this
literature, focusing on economics and empirical essays.
  The paper improves on the existing literature: (a) providing systematic
research of the literature through main bibliographic databases, followed by a
review and bibliometric analysis of all resulting papers; (b) building a
citation-based network of contributions, that hollows to identify four separate
clusters of paper; (c) applying meta-analysis methods on the sample of 96

working papers series or unpublished studies, providing 3,904 point estimates

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different

station-based data which is mostly limited upto the metropolitan cities. Also,
the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and
developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage

Natural Selection as the sum over all histories,2021-01-04T12:41:18Z,Clive Edward Neal Sturgess,"If evolution can be connected to the principle of least action, and if it is
depicted in evolution space versus time then it corresponds to the direction of
ultimate causation. As an organism evolves and follows a path of proximate
causation, if the vector is closely parallel to that of the ultimate causation
then the changes will confer desirable attributes which will lead to further
development. If however the variations do not occur in a direction close to the
of the ultimate causation vector the evolved organism will quickly die out.
This may be viewed as similar to Feynmans sum over all histories. Therefore,
the principle of least action gives a direction, but not a purpose, to
evolution. Taking the coevolution model of Lewontin, an equation of motion for
coevolution shows that it is the rate of evolutionary change that responds to
changes in the environment, in line with some evidence. In the face of widely
held views on mass extinctions because of climate change this gives some small
hope.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01563v1

  Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Problems with Slowly Changing Variables in
  A Continuous State Space",2021-06-10T04:58:31Z,"Vincent Zha, Ivey Chiu, Alexandre Guilbault, Jaime Tatis","Slowly changing variables in a continuous state space constitute an important
category of reinforcement learning and see its application in many domains,
such as modeling a climate control system where temperature, humidity, etc.
change slowly over time. However, this subject is less addressed in recent
studies. Classical methods with certain variants, such as Dynamic Programming
with Tile Coding which discretizes the state space, fail to handle slowly
changing variables because those methods cannot capture the tiny changes in
each transition step, as it is computationally expensive or impossible to
establish an extremely granular grid system. In this paper, we introduce a
Hyperspace Neighbor Penetration (HNP) approach that solves the problem. HNP
captures in each transition step the state's partial ""penetration"" into its
neighboring hyper-tiles in the gridded hyperspace, thus does not require the
transition to be inter-tile in order for the change to be captured. Therefore,
HNP allows for a very coarse grid system, which makes the computation feasible.
HNP assumes near linearity of the transition function in a local space, which
is commonly satisfied. In summary, HNP can be orders of magnitude more
efficient than classical method in handling slowly changing variables in
reinforcement learning. We have made an industrial implementation of NHP with a
great success.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05497v1
Selection and mutation in a shifting and fluctuating environment,2021-03-12T14:40:12Z,"Susely Figueroa Iglesias, Sepideh Mirrahimi","We study the evolutionary dynamics of a phenotypically structured population
in a changing environment , where the environmental conditions vary with a
linear trend but in an oscillatory manner. Such phenomena can be described by
parabolic Lotka-Volterra type equations with non-local competition and a time
dependent growth rate. We first study the long time behavior of the solution to
this problem. Next, using an approach based on Hamilton-Jacobi equations we
study asymptotically such long time solutions when the effects of the mutations
are small. We prove that, as the effect of the mutations vanishes, the
phenotypic density of the population concentrates on a single trait which
varies linearly with time, while the size of the population oscillates
periodically. In contrast with the case of an environment without linear shift,
such dominant trait does not have the maximal growth rate in the averaged
environment and there is a cost on the growth rate due to the climate shift. We
also provide an asymptotic expansion for the average size of the population and
for the critical speed above which the population goes extinct, which is
closely related to the derivation of an asymptotic expansion for the Floquet
eigenvalue in terms of the diffusion rate. By mean of a biological example,
this expansion allows to show that the fluctuations on the environment may help
the population to follow the climatic shift in a better way.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07317v2

Australia, and the West Pacific is noted for the frequent occurrence and
severity of its storms. These storms give rise to high-amplitude secondary
microseisms from sources, including the deep ocean regions, and primary
microseisms where the swells impinge on submarine topographic features. A
better understanding of the varying microseism wavefield enables improvements
to seismic imaging and development of proxy observables to complement sparse in
situ wave observations and hindcast models of the global ocean wave climate. We
analyze 12-26 years of seismic data from 11 seismic stations either on the East
Antarctic coast or sited in the Indian Ocean, Australia, and New Zealand. The
power spectral density of the seismic wavefield is calculated to explore how
the time-changing microseism intensity varies with (i) sea ice coverage
surrounding Antarctica and (ii) the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) climate index.
Variations in sea ice extent are found to be the dominant control on the
microseism intensity at Antarctic stations, which exhibit a seasonal pattern
phase-shifted by 4-5 months compared to stations in other continents. Peaks in
extremal intensity at East Antarctic stations occur in March-April, with the
highest peaks for secondary microseisms occurring during negative SAM events.
This relationship between microseism intensity and the SAM index is opposite to
that observed on the Antarctic Peninsula. This work informs the complexity of
microseism amplitudes in the Southern Hemisphere and assists ongoing
interdisciplinary investigations of interannual variability and long-term
trends.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08590v1

sensing, plays an important role in the development of reliable techniques to
provide useful support to the competent authorities. Therefore, in this work,
the capability of the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), derived from
spaceborne remote sensing (RS) data, is assessed to monitor the forest fires
occurred on a specific study area during the summer of 2017: the volcano
Vesuvius, near Naples (in Campania, Italy). In particular, the index is
obtained from Sentinel-2 multispectral images of the European Space Agency
(ESA), which are free of charge and open accessible. Moreover, the twin
Sentinel-2 (S-2) sensors allows to overcome some restrictions on time delivery
and high frequency observation. These requirements are goodly matched by other
spaceborne sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS satellites, but at the expense of a
lower spatial resolution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10352v1

to slow transmission. Public health measures had different intensities across
European countries but all had significant impact on peoples daily lives and
economic activities, causing a drop of CO2 emissions of about 10% for the whole
year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and
built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas
flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that
reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production
across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also
decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March
2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of
comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate

"Carbon Leakage in a European Power System with Inhomogeneous Carbon
  Prices",2021-05-12T14:00:30Z,"Markus Schlott, Omar El Sayed, Mariia Bilousova, Fabian Hofmann, Alexander Kies, Horst Stöcker","Global warming is one of the main threats to the future of humanity and
extensive emissions of greenhouse gases are found to be the main cause of
global temperature rise as well as climate change. During the last decades
international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for
viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of
greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First,
to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now,
various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe
and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing.
However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies
significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices
in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals.
In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices
regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution
parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with
the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the
spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among
the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed
lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired
electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power
in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe - representing a potential risk for the
long term decarbonization targets within the European Union.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05669v1
Accelerating Weather Prediction using Near-Memory Reconfigurable Fabric,2021-07-19T09:41:19Z,"Gagandeep Singh, Dionysios Diamantopoulos, Juan Gómez-Luna, Christoph Hagleitner, Sander Stuijk, Henk Corporaal, Onur Mutlu","Ongoing climate change calls for fast and accurate weather and climate
modeling. However, when solving large-scale weather prediction simulations,
state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations suffer from limited performance
and high energy consumption. These implementations are dominated by complex
irregular memory access patterns and low arithmetic intensity that pose
fundamental challenges to acceleration. To overcome these challenges, we
propose and evaluate the use of near-memory acceleration using a reconfigurable
fabric with high-bandwidth memory (HBM). We focus on compound stencils that are
fundamental kernels in weather prediction models. By using high-level synthesis
techniques, we develop NERO, an FPGA+HBM-based accelerator connected through
OCAPI (Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) to an IBM POWER9 host
system. Our experimental results show that NERO outperforms a 16-core POWER9
system by 5.3x and 12.7x when running two different compound stencil kernels.
NERO reduces the energy consumption by 12x and 35x for the same two kernels
over the POWER9 system with an energy efficiency of 1.61 GFLOPS/Watt and 21.01

role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.
Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done
via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.
To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine
learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial
imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical
reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and
satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial
imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a

have combined to revolutionize the study of ocean biogeochemical cycling, but
comparing the two data streams to each other and across time remains
challenging due to the strong spatial-temporal structuring of the ocean. Here,
we show that the Wasserstein distance provides a powerful metric for harnessing
these structured datasets for better marine ecosystem and climate predictions.
Wasserstein distance complements commonly used point-wise difference methods
such as the root mean squared error, by quantifying differences in terms of
spatial displacement in addition to magnitude. As a test case we consider
Chlorophyll (a key indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in the North-East
Pacific Ocean, obtained from model simulations, in situ measurements, and
satellite observations. We focus on two main applications: 1) Comparing model
predictions with satellite observations, and 2) temporal evolution of
Chlorophyll both seasonally and over longer time frames. Wasserstein distance
successfully isolates temporal and depth variability and quantifies shifts in
biogeochemical province boundaries. It also exposes relevant temporal trends in
satellite Chlorophyll consistent with climate change predictions. Our study
shows that optimal transport vectors underlying Wasserstein distance provide a
novel visualization tool for testing models and better understanding temporal

"Empathosphere: Promoting Constructive Communication in Ad-hoc Virtual
  Teams through Perspective-taking Spaces",2021-11-27T00:34:34Z,"Pranav Khadpe, Chinmay Kulkarni, Geoff Kaufman","When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or
deliberate, they often fail to engage with each others' perspectives in a
constructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst,
it can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working
together. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by
highlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter
interaction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because
they fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team
norms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless
team members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion
will be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded
intervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication
in teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the benefits
of ""experimental spaces"" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate
conducive to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses
the benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a
norm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere
achieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to
induce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to
an alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team
experience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction,
encouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted
teams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that
``experimental spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of
encouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving
communication in virtual teams.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13782v1

management approaches, necessitating knowledge of total water storage, and
changes in water mass. Such monitoring is not practical at continental scales
using traditional methods. Satellite gravity has proven successful at
documenting changes in total water mass at regional scales, and here we use
data from the Grace and Grace-FO missions, spanning 2002 - 2020, to track
regional water budget trends in Australia most heavily utilised basin systems,
including the Murray-Darling Basin. The period of analysis covers the
Millennium drought (2002-2009) and 2010-11 heavy flooding events, which
contribute significant signal variability. However our extended datasets
demonstrate a negative trend in the geoid anomaly over the Murray-Darling Basin
of -1.5mm, equivalent to a water loss rate of -0.91 Gt yr-1. With the exception
of northern Australia, similar scale geoid declines are observed in most
Australian basin systems analysed - implying declining total water storage.
Long-term declines in water availability require concerted management plans,
balancing the requirements of agriculture and industry, with domestic use,

  Transition",2021-04-14T17:27:24Z,"Bowen Fan, Zhihong Tan, Tiffany A. Shaw, Edwin S. Kite","Earth's modern climate is characterized by wet, rainy deep tropics, however
paleoclimate and planetary science have revealed a wide range of hydrological
cycle regimes connected to different external parameters. Here we investigate
how surface wetness affects the tropical hydrological cycle. When surface
wetness is decreased in an Earth-like general circulation model, the tropics
remain wet but transition from a rainy to rain-free regime. The rain-free
regime occurs when surface precipitation is suppressed as negative evaporation
(surface condensation) balances moisture flux convergence. The regime
transition is dominated by near-surface relative humidity changes in contrast
to the hypothesis that relative humidity changes are small. We show
near-surface relative humidity changes responsible for the regime transition
are controlled by re-evaporation of stratiform precipitation near the lifting
condensation level. Re-evaporation impacts the near-surface through vertical
mixing. Our results reveal a new rain-free tropical hydrological cycle regime
that goes beyond the wet/dry paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06995v1

are frequently overlooked due to a lack of appropriate assessment methods.
Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) is a method to capture the
environmental consequences of the entire cause and effect chain of these
disruptions but has never been adapted to transportat disruption at the city
scale. This paper proposes a mathematical formalization of CLCA applied to a
territorial mobility change. The method is applied to quantify the impact on
climate change of the breakthrough of free-floating e-scooters (FFES) in Paris.
A FFES user survey is conducted to estimate the modal shifts due to FFES. Trip
substitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered - personal
or shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus,
streetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit
system). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA.
Final results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen
thousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to
major shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER,
22% from active modes). Recommendations are given to enhance their carbon
footprint. A scenario analysis shows that increasing the lifetime mileage is
insufficient to get a positive balance: reducing drastically servicing
emissions is also required. A sensitivity analysis switching the French
electricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change
effect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon
intensity, such as in Germany and China. Finally, the novelty and the limits of
the method are discussed, as well as the results and the role of e-scooters,
micromobility, and shared vehicles towards a sustainable mobility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00680v1

Li-doped Beryllonitrene for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Capture,2021-10-06T05:32:35Z,"Andrew Pu, Xuan Luo","In recent years, the scientific community has given more and more attention
to the issue of climate change and global warming, which is largely attributed

carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this
study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional
theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped
beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy
of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has
extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could
be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped
beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine
beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,
and band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly

North Atlantic freshwater budget and thermohaline circulation [1]. Due to
global warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an
unprecedent rate towards full melt during the summer season, driving the
so-called ""Arctic amplification"" [2]. However, the Arctic sea-ice has also
experienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)

has been a major driver of Arctic sea-ice variability through time, sea-level
changes governed the development of ""sea-ice factories"" over shelves (Figure

the future electricity demand pattern is highly uncertain due to various

radiative response also means that atmospheric CO$_2$ changes of a given mass

linked to atmospheric pCO$_2$ through seawater carbonate speciation and calcium
carbonate dissolution/precipitation, and the response of pH to changes in
