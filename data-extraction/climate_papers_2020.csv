You are right. I am ALARMED -- But by Climate Change Counter Movement,2020-04-30T16:06:02Z,"Shraey Bhatia, Jey Han Lau, Timothy Baldwin","The world is facing the challenge of climate crisis. Despite the consensus in
scientific community about anthropogenic global warming, the web is flooded
with articles spreading climate misinformation. These articles are carefully
constructed by climate change counter movement (cccm) organizations to
influence the narrative around climate change. We revisit the literature on
climate misinformation in social sciences and repackage it to introduce in the
community of NLP. Despite considerable work in detection of fake news, there is
no misinformation dataset available that is specific to the domain.of climate
change. We try to bridge this gap by scraping and releasing articles with known
climate change misinformation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14907v1
Climate Monitoring using Internet of X-Things,2020-05-30T09:54:09Z,"Nasir Saeed, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Mohamed-Slim Alouini","Global climate change is significantly affecting the life on planet Earth.
Predicting timely changes in the climate is a big challenge and requires great
attention from the scientific community. Research now suggests that using the
internet of X-things (X-IoT) helps in monitoring global climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00231v1
Future Climate Change Projections over the Indian Region,2020-12-02T07:46:57Z,"J. Sanjay, R. Krishnan, M. V. S. Ramarao, R. Mahesh, Bhupendra Bahadur Singh, Jayashri Patel, Sandip Ingle, Preethi Bhaskar, J. V. Revadekar, T. P. Sabin, M. Mujumdar","Assessments of impacts of climate change and future projections over the
Indian region, have so far relied on a single regional climate model (RCM) -
eg., the PRECIS RCM of the Hadley Centre, UK. While these assessments have
provided inputs to various reports (e.g., INCCA 2010; NATCOMM2 2012), it is
important to have an ensemble of climate projections drawn from multiple RCMs
due to large uncertainties in regional-scale climate projections. Ensembles of
multi-RCM projections driven under different perceivable socio-economic
scenarios are required to capture the probable path of growth, and provide the
behavior of future climate and impacts on various biophysical systems and
economic sectors dependent on such systems.
  The Centre for Climate Change Research, Indian Institute of Tropical
Meteorology (CCCR-IITM) has generated an ensemble of high resolution downscaled
projections of regional climate and monsoon over South Asia until 2100 for the
Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC)using a RCM (ICTP-RegCM4) at
50 km horizontal resolution, by driving the regional model with lateral and
lower boundary conditions from multiple global atmosphere-ocean coupled models
from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The future
projections are based on three Representation Concentration Pathway (RCP)
scenarios (viz., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) of the IPCC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10386v1
"The Human Effect Requires Affect: Addressing Social-Psychological
  Factors of Climate Change with Machine Learning",2020-11-24T23:34:54Z,"Kyle Tilbury, Jesse Hoey","Machine learning has the potential to aid in mitigating the human effects of
climate change. Previous applications of machine learning to tackle the human
effects in climate change include approaches like informing individuals of
their carbon footprint and strategies to reduce it. For these methods to be the
most effective they must consider relevant social-psychological factors for
each individual. Of social-psychological factors at play in climate change,
affect has been previously identified as a key element in perceptions and
willingness to engage in mitigative behaviours. In this work, we propose an
investigation into how affect could be incorporated to enhance machine learning
based interventions for climate change. We propose using affective agent-based
modelling for climate change as well as the use of a simulated climate change
social dilemma to explore the potential benefits of affective machine learning
interventions. Behavioural and informational interventions can be a powerful
tool in helping humans adopt mitigative behaviours. We expect that utilizing
affective ML can make interventions an even more powerful tool and help
mitigative behaviours become widely adopted.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12443v1
The Role of Uncertainty in Controlling Climate Change,2020-03-03T16:00:26Z,Yongyang Cai,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of the climate and economy aim to analyze
the impact and efficacy of policies that aim to control climate change, such as
carbon taxes and subsidies. A major characteristic of IAMs is that their
geophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the
preindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the
existing IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we
know all of the future information. However, there are significant
uncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter
uncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and
ambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume
that climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others
assume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth.
Climate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may
lead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice
sheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and
associated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture
and storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain
too. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a
decision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality
aversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem
may require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced
computational methods. The recent literature has shown that these uncertainties
can be incorporated into IAMs and may change optimal climate policies
significantly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01615v2
Regional Climate Change Datasets for South Asia,2020-12-02T07:48:36Z,"J. Sanjay, M. V. S. Ramarao, R. Mahesh, Sandip Ingle, Bhupendra Bahadur Singh, R. Krishnan","The Centre for Climate Change Research (CCCR;http://cccr.tropmet.res.in) at
the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM; http://www.tropmet.res.in),
Pune, launched in 2009 with the support of the Ministry of Earth Sciences
(MoES), Government of India, focuses on the development of new climate
modelling capabilities in India and South Asia to address issues concerning the
science of climate change. CCCR-IITM has the mandate of developing an Earth
System Model and to make the regional climate projections. An important
achievement was made by developing an Earth System Model at IITM, which is an
important step towards understanding global and regional climate response to
long-term climate variability and climate change. CCCR-IITM has also generated
an ensemble of high resolution dynamically downscaled future projections of
regional climate over South Asia and Indian monsoon, which are found useful for
impact assessment studies and for quantifying uncertainties in the regional
projections. A brief overview of these core climate change modeling activities
of CCCR-IITM was presented in an Interim Report on Climate Change over India

CLIMATE-FEVER: A Dataset for Verification of Real-World Climate Claims,2020-12-01T16:32:54Z,"Thomas Diggelmann, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Jannis Bulian, Massimiliano Ciaramita, Markus Leippold","We introduce CLIMATE-FEVER, a new publicly available dataset for verification
of climate change-related claims. By providing a dataset for the research
community, we aim to facilitate and encourage work on improving algorithms for
retrieving evidential support for climate-specific claims, addressing the
underlying language understanding challenges, and ultimately help alleviate the
impact of misinformation on climate change. We adapt the methodology of FEVER
[1], the largest dataset of artificially designed claims, to real-life claims
collected from the Internet. While during this process, we could rely on the
expertise of renowned climate scientists, it turned out to be no easy task. We
discuss the surprising, subtle complexity of modeling real-world
climate-related claims within the \textsc{fever} framework, which we believe
provides a valuable challenge for general natural language understanding. We
hope that our work will mark the beginning of a new exciting long-term joint
effort by the climate science and AI community.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00614v2

HECT: High-Dimensional Ensemble Consistency Testing for Climate Models,2020-10-08T15:16:16Z,"Niccol√≤ Dalmasso, Galen Vincent, Dorit Hammerling, Ann B. Lee","Climate models play a crucial role in understanding the effect of
environmental and man-made changes on climate to help mitigate climate risks
and inform governmental decisions. Large global climate models such as the
Community Earth System Model (CESM), developed by the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, are very complex with millions of lines of code
describing interactions of the atmosphere, land, oceans, and ice, among other
components. As development of the CESM is constantly ongoing, simulation
outputs need to be continuously controlled for quality. To be able to
distinguish a ""climate-changing"" modification of the code base from a true
climate-changing physical process or intervention, there needs to be a
principled way of assessing statistical reproducibility that can handle both
spatial and temporal high-dimensional simulation outputs. Our proposed work
uses probabilistic classifiers like tree-based algorithms and deep neural
networks to perform a statistically rigorous goodness-of-fit test of
high-dimensional spatio-temporal data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04051v2
"Toward an Effective Pedagogy of Climate Change: Lessons From a Physics
  Classroom",2020-08-01T15:19:26Z,Vandana Singh,"A major roadblock to effective climate education is the lack of radical
visions (Kwauk, 2020) for engaging with climate change and related
social-environmental crises in the classroom. Key aspects of the climate
system: its inherent complexity and transdisciplinarity, the entanglement of
social and natural systems, and the fact that it spans large scales of space
and time - all present serious challenges to our modern, compartmentalized
formal education systems. I present an argument for a justice-centered,
inter-to-transdisciplinary conceptualization of climate change at the nexus of
science, society and justice, which is designed to engage with the very
features of the climate system that make it challenging. Based on pedagogical
experiments in an undergraduate physics classroom for non-science majors, I
identify five general barriers to teaching climate change, and formulate four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy: the scientific-technological, the
transdisciplinary, the onto-epistemological, and the psychosocial action
dimensions. Within the context of a collaborative classroom culture informed by
transformational learning, I describe the use of a meta-conceptual framework
that, along with the issue of climate justice, seeks to realize all four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy. This broad holistic framework is
potentially adaptable to contexts and disciplines beyond undergraduate physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00281v2
