Indian region, have so far relied on a single regional climate model (RCM) -
eg., the PRECIS RCM of the Hadley Centre, UK. While these assessments have
provided inputs to various reports (e.g., INCCA 2010; NATCOMM2 2012), it is
important to have an ensemble of climate projections drawn from multiple RCMs
due to large uncertainties in regional-scale climate projections. Ensembles of
multi-RCM projections driven under different perceivable socio-economic
scenarios are required to capture the probable path of growth, and provide the
behavior of future climate and impacts on various biophysical systems and
economic sectors dependent on such systems.

"The Human Effect Requires Affect: Addressing Social-Psychological
  Factors of Climate Change with Machine Learning",2020-11-24T23:34:54Z,"Kyle Tilbury, Jesse Hoey","Machine learning has the potential to aid in mitigating the human effects of
climate change. Previous applications of machine learning to tackle the human
effects in climate change include approaches like informing individuals of
their carbon footprint and strategies to reduce it. For these methods to be the
most effective they must consider relevant social-psychological factors for
each individual. Of social-psychological factors at play in climate change,
affect has been previously identified as a key element in perceptions and
willingness to engage in mitigative behaviours. In this work, we propose an
investigation into how affect could be incorporated to enhance machine learning
based interventions for climate change. We propose using affective agent-based
modelling for climate change as well as the use of a simulated climate change
social dilemma to explore the potential benefits of affective machine learning
interventions. Behavioural and informational interventions can be a powerful
tool in helping humans adopt mitigative behaviours. We expect that utilizing
affective ML can make interventions an even more powerful tool and help
mitigative behaviours become widely adopted.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12443v1
The Role of Uncertainty in Controlling Climate Change,2020-03-03T16:00:26Z,Yongyang Cai,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of the climate and economy aim to analyze
the impact and efficacy of policies that aim to control climate change, such as
carbon taxes and subsidies. A major characteristic of IAMs is that their
geophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the
preindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the
existing IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we
know all of the future information. However, there are significant
uncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter
uncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and
ambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume
that climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others
assume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth.
Climate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may
lead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice
sheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and
associated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture
and storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain
too. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a
decision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality
aversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem
may require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced
computational methods. The recent literature has shown that these uncertainties
can be incorporated into IAMs and may change optimal climate policies
significantly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01615v2

outputs need to be continuously controlled for quality. To be able to
distinguish a ""climate-changing"" modification of the code base from a true
climate-changing physical process or intervention, there needs to be a
principled way of assessing statistical reproducibility that can handle both

"Toward an Effective Pedagogy of Climate Change: Lessons From a Physics
  Classroom",2020-08-01T15:19:26Z,Vandana Singh,"A major roadblock to effective climate education is the lack of radical
visions (Kwauk, 2020) for engaging with climate change and related
social-environmental crises in the classroom. Key aspects of the climate
system: its inherent complexity and transdisciplinarity, the entanglement of
social and natural systems, and the fact that it spans large scales of space
and time - all present serious challenges to our modern, compartmentalized
formal education systems. I present an argument for a justice-centered,
inter-to-transdisciplinary conceptualization of climate change at the nexus of
science, society and justice, which is designed to engage with the very
features of the climate system that make it challenging. Based on pedagogical
experiments in an undergraduate physics classroom for non-science majors, I
identify five general barriers to teaching climate change, and formulate four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy: the scientific-technological, the
transdisciplinary, the onto-epistemological, and the psychosocial action
dimensions. Within the context of a collaborative classroom culture informed by
transformational learning, I describe the use of a meta-conceptual framework
that, along with the issue of climate justice, seeks to realize all four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy. This broad holistic framework is
potentially adaptable to contexts and disciplines beyond undergraduate physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00281v2

occurrence of extreme weather events. However, although meteorology has been
considered as a factor in modern architecture design, it remains unclear
whether and how the ancients adapted to climate change from the perspective of
architecture design, particularly on a millennium time scale. Here we show that
the periodic change and trend of the roof slope of ancient architectures in
northern China clearly demonstrate the climate change adaptation over the past
thousand years. We show that the snowfall fluctuation caused by the
paleo-climate change was an essential driving factor within the roof

public policymakers and researchers have attempted to understand the factors
associated with this support for climate change mitigation policy. In this
article, we compare the feasibility of using different supervised learning
methods for regression using a novel socio-economic data set which measures
public support for potential climate change mitigation policies. Following this
model selection, we utilize gradient boosting regression, a well-known
technique in the machine learning community, but relatively uncommon in public
policy and public opinion research, and seek to understand what factors among
the several examined in previous studies are most central to shaping public
support for mitigation policies in climate change studies. The use of this
method provides novel insights into the most important factors for public
support for climate change mitigation policies. Using national survey data, we
find that the perceived risks associated with climate change are more decisive
for shaping public support for policy options promoting renewable energy and
regulating pollutants. However, we observe a very different behavior related to
public support for increasing the use of nuclear energy where climate change
risk perception is no longer the sole decisive feature. Our findings indicate
that public support for renewable energy is inherently different from that for
nuclear energy reliance with the risk perception of climate change, dominant
for the former, playing a subdued role for the latter.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10234v1
Emergent constraints on climate sensitivities,2020-12-17T09:46:47Z,"Mark S. Williamson, Chad W. Thackeray, Peter M. Cox, Alex Hall, Chris Huntingford, Femke J. M. M. Nijsse","Despite major advances in climate science over the last 30 years, persistent
uncertainties in projections of future climate change remain. Climate
projections are produced with increasingly complex models which attempt to
represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic
circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea-ice, vegetation and interactions
with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes
feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate
models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major
improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to
doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than three. Here we review
a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the
uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system. The emergent
constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between
an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend
in the contemporary climate. This review summarises previous published work on
emergent constraints, and discusses the huge promise and potential dangers of
the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be
based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. It is hoped that this review will stimulate physicists to contribute
to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections,
bringing to it much needed rigour and physical insights.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09468v1

Affective Polarization in Online Climate Change Discourse on Twitter,2020-08-29T20:37:33Z,"Aman Tyagi, Joshua Uyheng, Kathleen M. Carley","Online social media has become an important platform to organize around
different socio-cultural and political topics. An extensive scholarship has

polarization in online conversations. Further, we apply our framework to 100
weeks of Twitter discourse about climate change. We find that deniers of
climate change (Disbelievers) are more hostile towards people who believe

Moreover, Disbelievers use more words and hashtags related to natural disasters

Using a two-dimensional energetics framework, we find that the revealed ITCZ
response is consistent with future changes in the divergent atmospheric energy
transport over the tropics, and sector-mean shifts of the energy flux equator
(EFE). The changes in the EFE appear to be the result of zonally opposing
imbalances in the hemispheric atmospheric heating over the two sectors,
consisting of increases in atmospheric heating over Eurasia and cooling over
the Southern Ocean, which contrast with atmospheric cooling over the North
Atlantic Ocean due to a model-projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional
overturning circulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00239v1
"Multivariate Estimations of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity from Short
  Transient Warming Simulations",2020-10-02T08:12:17Z,"Robbin Bastiaansen, Henk A. Dijkstra, Anna S. von der Heydt","One of the most used metrics to gauge the effects of climate change is the
equilibrium climate sensitivity, defined as the long-term (equilibrium)
temperature increase resulting from instantaneous doubling of atmospheric
CO$_2$. Since global climate models cannot be fully equilibrated in practice,
extrapolation techniques are used to estimate the equilibrium state from
transient warming simulations. Because of the abundance of climate feedbacks -
spanning a wide range of temporal scales - it is hard to extract long-term
behaviour from short-time series; predominantly used techniques are only
capable of detecting the single most dominant eigenmode, thus hampering their
ability to give accurate long-term estimates. Here, we present an extension to
those methods by incorporating data from multiple observables in a
multi-component linear regression model. This way, not only the dominant but
also the next-dominant eigenmodes of the climate system are captured, leading
to better long-term estimates from short, non-equilibrated time series.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00845v1

Entropy production rates of the climate,2020-08-05T14:02:54Z,"Goodwin Gibbins, Joanna D. Haigh","There is ongoing interest in the global entropy production rate as a climate
diagnostic and predictor, but progress has been limited by ambiguities in its
definition; different conceptual boundaries of the climate system give rise to
different internal production rates. Three viable options are described,
estimated and investigated here, two of which -- the material and the total
radiative (here 'planetary') entropy production rates -- are well-established
and a third which has only recently been considered but appears very promising.
This new option is labelled the 'transfer' entropy production rate and includes
all irreversible processes that transfer heat within the climate, radiative and
material, but not those involved in the exchange of radiation with space.
Estimates in three model climates put the material rate in the range $27$-$48$
mW/m$^2$K, the transfer rate $67$-$76$ mW/m$^2$K, and the planetary rate
$1279$-$1312$ mW/m$^2$K.
  The climate-relevance of each rate is probed by calculating their responses
to climate changes in a simple radiative-convective model. An increased
greenhouse effect causes a significant increase in the material and transfer
entropy production rates but has no direct impact on the planetary rate. When
the same surface temperature increase is forced by changing the albedo instead,
the material and transfer entropy production rates increase less dramatically
and the planetary rate also registers an increase. This is pertinent to solar
radiation management as it demonstrates the difficulty of reversing greenhouse
gas-mediated climate changes by albedo alterations. It is argued that the
transfer perspective has particular significance in the climate system and
warrants increased prominence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02141v1

atmospheric pressure variability, holds significant influence over weather
patterns in North America and Northern Europe. A negative (positive) NAO value
signifies increased cold air outbreaks and storm occurrences (reduced
occurrences) in these regions. NAO, a product of multiple climate factors,
demonstrates intricate dynamics with sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice
extent (SIE). In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to explore the
complex interplay between NAO, SST, and SIE, revealing a critical instability
rooted in positive feedback loops among these climate variables. Our
statistical machine learning methodology examines the impacts of melting Arctic
SIE and rising SST on NAO, thereby understanding the weather patterns across
the North Atlantic region. The skewness analysis yields a negative skewness in
NAO across various time intervals -- daily, weekly, and monthly. This skewness,
coupled with NAO's mean zero stationary nature, accentuates system instability.
To capture these dynamics, we formulate a Bayesian Granger-causal dynamic
linear model, which effectively updates the predictor-dependent variable
relationship over time. The findings underscore an impending critical
instability, indicative of more frequent occurrences of intensely cold climates

Atmospheric dynamics on terrestrial planets with eccentric orbits,2020-04-30T10:23:18Z,"Ilai Guendelman, Yohai Kaspi","The insolation a planet receives from its parent star is the main driver of
the climate and depends on the planet's orbital configuration. Planets with
non-zero obliquity and eccentricity experience seasonal insolation variations.
As a result, the climate exhibits a seasonal cycle, with its strength depending
on the orbital configuration and atmospheric characteristics. In this study,
using an idealized general circulation model, we examine the climate response
to changes in eccentricity for both zero and non-zero obliquity planets. In the
zero obliquity case, a comparison between the seasonal response to changes in
eccentricity and perpetual changes in the solar constant shows that the
seasonal response strongly depends on the orbital period and radiative
timescale. More specifically, using a simple energy balance model, we show the
importance of the latitudinal structure of the radiative timescale in the
climate response. We also show that the response strongly depends on the
atmospheric moisture content. The combination of an eccentric orbit with
non-zero obliquity is complex, as the insolation also depends on the perihelion
position. Although the detailed response of the climate to variations in
eccentricity, obliquity, and perihelion is involved, the circulation is
constrained mainly by the thermal Rossby number and the maximum temperature
latitude. Finally, we discuss the importance of different planetary parameters
that affect the climate response to orbital configuration variations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14673v2

possibly increased hurricanes under climate change. We apply hurricane and
heatwave projections with power outage and recovery process analysis to
investigate how the emerging hurricane-blackout-heatwave compound hazard may
vary in a changing climate, for Harris County in Texas (including major part of
Houston City) as an example. We find that, under the high-emissions scenario
RCP8.5, the expected percent of customers experiencing at least one
longer-than-5-day hurricane-induced power outage in a 20-year period would
increase significantly from 14% at the end of the 20th century to 44% at the
end of the 21st century in Harris County. The expected percent of customers who
may experience at least one longer-than-5-day heatwave without power (to
provide air conditioning) would increase alarmingly, from 0.8% to 15.5%. These
increases of risk may be largely avoided if the climate is well controlled
under the stringent mitigation scenario RCP2.6. We also reveal that a moderate
enhancement of critical sectors of the distribution network can significantly
improve the resilience of the entire power grid and mitigate the risk of the
future compound hazard. Together these findings suggest that, in addition to
climate mitigation, climate adaptation actions are urgently needed to improve

"A model for Dansgaard-Oeschger events and millennial-scale abrupt
  climate change without external forcing",2020-05-31T01:40:10Z,Georg A. Gottwald,"We propose a conceptual model which generates abrupt climate changes akin to
Dansgaard-Oeschger events. In the model these abrupt climate changes are not
triggered by external perturbations but rather emerge in a dynamic
self-consistent model through complex interactions of the ocean, the atmosphere
and an intermittent process. The abrupt climate changes are caused in our model
by intermittencies in the sea-ice cover. The ocean is represented by a Stommel
two-box model, the atmosphere by a Lorenz-84 model and the sea-ice cover by a
deterministic approximation of correlated additive and multiplicative noise
(CAM) process. The key dynamical ingredients of the model are given by
stochastic limits of deterministic multi-scale systems and recent results in
deterministic homogenisation theory. The deterministic model reproduces
statistical features of actual ice-core data such as non-Gaussian
$\alpha$-stable behaviour. The proposed mechanism for abrupt millenial-scale
climate change only relies on the existence of a quantity, which exhibits
intermittent dynamics on an intermediate time scale. We consider as a
particular mechanism intermittent sea-ice cover where the intermittency is
generated by emergent atmospheric noise. However, other mechanisms such as
freshwater influxes may also be formulated within the proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00405v2

warnings of flood or drought risk in a changing climate. However, to make
trust-worthy predictions of precipitation, at a local scale, is one of the most
difficult challenges for today's weather and climate models. This is because
important features, such as individual clouds and high-resolution topography,
cannot be resolved explicitly within simulations due to the significant
computational cost of high-resolution simulations. Climate models are typically
run at $\sim$50-100 km resolution which is insufficient to represent local
precipitation events in satisfying detail. Here, we develop a method to make
probabilistic precipitation predictions based on features that climate models
can resolve well and that is not highly sensitive to the approximations used in
individual models. To predict, we will use a temporal compound Poisson
distribution dependent on the output of climate models at a location. We use
the output of Earth System models at coarse resolution $\sim$50 km as input and
train the statistical models towards precipitation observations over Wales at
$\sim$10 km resolution. A Bayesian inferential scheme is provided so that the
compound-Poisson model can be inferred using a
Gibbs-within-Metropolis-Elliptic-Slice sampling scheme which enables us to
quantify the uncertainty of our predictions. In addition, we use a Gaussian
process regressor on the posterior samples of the model parameters, to infer a
spatially coherent model and hence to produce spatially coherent rainfall

present-day climate simulations conducted with the atmosphere component of the
Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (EAMv1) at 1-degree horizontal
resolution. We show that a factor-of-6 reduction of time step size in all major
parts of the model leads to significant changes in the long-term mean climate.
These changes imply that the reduction of temporal truncation errors leads to a
notable although unsurprising degradation of agreement between the simulated
and observed present-day climate; the model would require retuning to regain
optimal climate fidelity in the absence of those truncation errors. A
coarse-grained attribution of the time step sensitivities is carried out by
separately shortening time steps used in various components of EAM or by
revising the numerical coupling between some processes. The results provide
useful clues to help better understand the root causes of time step
sensitivities in EAM. The experimentation strategy used here can also provide a
pathway for other models to identify and reduce time integration errors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07479v3

Impacts of Solar Intermittency on Future Photovoltaic Reliability,2020-01-30T08:41:39Z,"Jun Yin, Annalisa Molini, Amilcare Porporato","As photovoltaic power is expanding rapidly worldwide, it is imperative to
assess its promise under future climate scenarios. While a great deal of
research has been devoted to trends of mean solar radiation, less attention has
been paid to its intermittent character, a key challenge when compounded with
uncertainties related to climate variability. Using both satellite data and
climate model outputs, here we characterize solar radiation intermittency to
assess future photovoltaic reliability. We find that the relation between the
future power supply and long-term trends of mean solar radiation is highly
nonlinear, thus making power reliability more sensitive to the fluctuations of
mean solar radiation in regions where insolation is the highest. Our results

emissions, this metric is called the social cost of methane (SC-CH$_4$).
Because several key IAMs used for social cost estimation contain a simplified
model structure that prevents the endogenous modeling of non-CO$_2$ greenhouse
gases, very few estimates of the SC-CH$_4$ exist. For this reason, IAMs should
be updated to better represent methane cycle dynamics that are consistent with
comprehensive Earth System Models. We include feedbacks of climate change on
the methane cycle to estimate the SC-CH$_4$. Our expected value for the

climate change is driven by the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse

variability of the 8.2 ka event in central Europe. In all three speleothems,
the 8.2 ka event is clearly recorded as a pronounced negative excursion of the
{\delta}18O values and can be divided into a 'whole event' and a 'central
event'. All stalagmites show a similar structure of the event with a short
negative excursion prior to the 'central event', which marks the beginning of
the 'whole event'. The timing and duration of the 8.2.ka event are different
for the individual records, which may, however, be related to dating
uncertainties. Whereas stalagmite Bu4 from Bunker Cave also shows a negative
anomaly in the {\delta}13C values and Mg content during the event, the two
speleothems from the Herbstlabyrinth cave system do not show distinct peaks in
the other proxies. This may suggest that the speleothem {\delta}18O values
recorded in the three stalagmites do not primarily reflect climate change at
the cave site, but rather large-scale changes in the North Atlantic. This is
supported by comparison with climate modelling data, which suggest that the
negative peak in the speleothem {\delta}18O values is mainly due to lower
{\delta}18O values of precipitation above the cave and that temperature only
played a minor role. Alternatively, the other proxies may not be as sensitive

atmospheric biosignatures, change under different conditions is a key aspect
when studying Earth-like exoplanets. One important property is the atmospheric
mass hence pressure and its influence on the climatic conditions. Therefore,
the aim of the present study is to understand the influence of atmospheric mass
on climate, hence habitability, and the spectral appearance of planets with
Earth-like, that is, N2-O2 dominated, atmospheres orbiting the Sun at 1
Astronomical Unit. This work utilizes a 1D coupled, cloud-free,

pressure from 0.5 bar to 30 bar; and investigates temperature and key species
profiles, as well as emission and brightness temperature spectra in a range
between 2{\mu}m - 20{\mu}m. Increasing the surface pressure up to 4 bar leads
to an increase in the surface temperature due to increased greenhouse warming.
Above this point, Rayleigh scattering dominates and the surface temperature
decreases, reaching surface temperatures below 273K (approximately at ~34 bar
surface pressure). For ozone, nitrous oxide, water, methane, and carbon
dioxide, the spectral response either increases with surface temperature or
pressure depending on the species. Masking effects occur, for example, for the

in understanding how plant breeding programs can adapt their approaches for
global climate change, for example identification of superior varieties for
commercial release, intelligent sampling of testing environments in variety
development, and integrating weather parameters for a targeted breeding

computational climate science, studying the behaviour of those same numerical
equations over intervals much longer than weather events, and changes in

the recent decades, is receiving wide attention due to its very significant
adverse effects on climate. Whether global warming will continue even in the
future, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard,
the so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the
future climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global
temperature rise in the future.
  Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is
important to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this
article, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple
testing paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model
we assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process
emulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic
evolution of the time series as unknown.
  We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on

different assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly
support the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are

  Change with Weight Matrix Optimizing the Efficiency in Scaling Factor
  Estimation",2020-12-08T04:07:59Z,"Yan Li, Kun Chen, Jun Yan, Xuebin Zhang","The optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution of climate
change is based on a multiple regression where each covariate has measurement
error whose covariance matrix is the same as that of the regression error up to
a known scale. Inferences about the regression coefficients are critical not
only for making statements about detection and attribution but also for
quantifying the uncertainty in important outcomes derived from detection and
attribution analyses. When there is no errors-in-variables (EIV), the optimal
weight matrix in estimating the regression coefficients is the precision matrix
of the regression error which, in practice, is never known and has to be
estimated from climate model simulations. We construct a weight matrix by
inverting a nonlinear shrinkage estimate of the error covariance matrix that
minimizes loss functions directly targeting the uncertainty of the resulting
regression coefficient estimator. The resulting estimator of the regression
coefficients is asymptotically optimal as the sample size of the climate model
simulations and the matrix dimension go to infinity together with a limiting
ratio. When EIVs are present, the estimator of the regression coefficients
based on the proposed weight matrix is asymptotically more efficient than that
based on the inverse of the existing linear shrinkage estimator of the error
covariance matrix. The performance of the method is confirmed in finite sample
simulation studies mimicking realistic situations in terms of the length of the

"The PCL Framework: A strategic approach to comprehensive risk management
  in response to climate change impacts",2020-04-13T18:24:34Z,Youssef Nassef,"The PCL framework provides a comprehensive climate risk management approach
grounded in the assessment of societal values of financial and non-financial
loss tolerability. The framework optimizes response action across three main
clusters, namely preemptive adaptation (P) or risk reduction, contingent
arrangements (C), and loss acceptance (L); without a predetermined hierarchy
across them. The PCL Framework aims at including the three clusters of outlay
within a single continuum, and with the main policy outcome being a balanced
portfolio of actions across the three clusters by way of an optimization
module, such that the aggregate outlay is optimized in the long-term. It is
proposed that the approach be applied separately for each hazard to which the
target community is exposed. While it is currently applied to climate-related
risk management, the methodology can be repurposed for use in other contexts
where societal buy-in is central.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06144v1
Spread of Tweets in Climate Discussions,2020-10-19T19:22:57Z,"Yan Xia, Ted Hsuan Yun Chen, Mikko Kivelä","Characterising the spreading of ideas within echo chambers is essential for
understanding polarisation. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of
popular and viral content in climate change discussions on Twitter around the

sceptics. Operationalising popularity as the number of retweets and virality as
the spreading probability inferred using an independent cascade model, we find
that the viral themes echo and differ from the popular themes in interesting
ways. Most importantly, we find that the most viral themes in the two groups
reflect different types of bonds that tie the community together, yet both

such as mitigation of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable
development goals. Recently, social tipping processes have received increased
attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can
shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to
strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social
tipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability
transitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems,
political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and
behaviors.
  Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we
develop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes
critical to facilitating rapid social transformations. We find that social
tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied
climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human
agency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal
scales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social
tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal
definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those
processes that could be decisive for future trajectories to global
sustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this definition with the
European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes,
highlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement.
  Accordingly, this analytical framework for social tipping processes can be
utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change

"The Trouble with Water: Condensation, Circulation and Climate",2020-06-03T16:28:09Z,Geoffrey K. Vallis,"This article discussesl a few of the problems that arise in geophysical fluid
dynamics and climate that are associated with the presence of moisture in the

atmosphere but we also discuss how these problems might manifest themselves on
other planetary bodies, with particular attention to Titan where methane takes
on the role of water.
  GFD has traditionally been concerned with understanding the very basic
problems that lie at the foundation of dynamical meteorology and
ocean\-ography. Conventionally, and a little ironically, the subject mainly
considers `dry' fluids, meaning it does not concern itself overly much with
phase changes. The subject is often regarded as dry in another way, because it
does not consider problems perceived as relevant to the real world, such as
clouds or rainfall, which have typically been the province of complicated
numerical models. Those models often rely on parameterizations of unresolved
processes, parameterizations that may work very well but that often have a
semi-empirical basis. The consequent dichotomy between the foundations and the
applications prevents progress being made that has both a secure basis in
scientific understanding and a relevance to the Earth's climate, especially
where moisture is concerned. The dichotomy also inhibits progress in
understanding the climate of other planets, where observations are insufficient
to tune the parameterizations that weather and climate models for Earth rely
upon, and a more fundamental approach is called for. Here we discuss four
diverse examples of the problems with moisture: the determination of relative
humidity and cloudiness; the transport of water vapor and its possible change
under global warming; the moist shallow water equations and the Madden-Julian
Oscillation; and the hydrology cycle on other planetary bodies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02364v1

construct a series of dynamical and physical climate networks based on the

of the directed and weighted climate networks can serve as efficient long-term
predictors for ISMR forecasting. The developed prediction method produces a
forecast skill of 0.5 with a 5-month lead-time in advance by using the previous
calendar year's data. The skill of our ISMR forecast, is comparable to the
current state-of-the-art models, however, with quite a short (i.e., within one

associate it with network-delayed-ENSO and ENSO-monsoon connections. Moreover,
our approach allows predicting the all India rainfall, as well as forecasting
the different Indian homogeneous regions' rainfall, which is crucial for
agriculture in India. We reveal that global warming affects the climate network

has been adopted from the field of the latest climate-change-research to show
the importance of transient effect and ensemble interpretation of disease
spread. After presenting the extended bifurcation diagram of measles, the
temporal change of the phase space structure is investigated. By defining
statistical measures over the ensemble, we can interpret the internal
variability of the epidemic as the onset of complex dynamics even for those

function of monthly temperature and precipitation by employing generative
probabilistic models with parameters determined through Bayesian inference. Our
approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the
US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily
transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with
a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a
two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly
contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for
non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and
allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that
temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six
months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for
US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean
temperature 18-19$^\circ$C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of
24-25$^\circ$C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total
precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of
investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the
absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a
temperature increase of $2^\circ$C, relative to 1981-2014, results in the mean
yield decreasing by 8\%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of
around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the
impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally
significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other
approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that

  In contrast with deterministic series considered by Roy and Bhattacharya
(2020), in this article we take up random infinite series for our
investigation. Remarkably, our method does not require any simplifying
assumption. Albeit the Bayesian characterization theory for random series is no
different from that for the deterministic setup, construction of effective
upper bounds for partial sums, required for implementation, turns out to be a
challenging undertaking in the random setup. In this article, we construct
parametric and nonparametric upper bound forms for the partial sums of random
infinite series and demonstrate the generality of the latter in comparison to
the former. Simulation studies exhibit high accuracy and efficiency of the
nonparametric bound in all the setups that we consider.
  Finally, exploiting the property that the summands tend to zero in the case
of series convergence, we consider application of our nonparametric bound
driven Bayesian method to global climate change analysis. Specifically,
analyzing the global average temperature record over the years 1850--2016 and
Holocene global average temperature reconstruction data 12,000 years before

star and a permanently dark nightside orbiting dim stars are prime candidates
for habitability. Simulations of these planets often show the potential to
maintain an Earth-like climate with a complete hydrological cycle. Here, we
examine the sensitivity of the atmospheric water cycle to changes in stellar
flux and describe the main underlying mechanisms. In a slowly-rotating,
tidally-locked Earth-like atmospheric model, the response to a small (about
10%) increase in stellar irradiance from a habitable-zone control simulation is
examined. The water cycle is enhanced in response to the increased stellar
irradiance. While the evaporation increase behaves similarly to the stellar
radiation increase, the day-to-night energy transport by the mean circulation
is critical to the planet's precipitation changes. Increased efficiency of the
energy transport in a warmer climate shapes the substellar precipitation
increase. On the nightside, precipitation changes are weak as a result of the
large cancellation between the increased energy transport and the increased
longwave emission. The day-to-night energy transport efficiency is sensitive to
the variation of the atmosphere's vertical stratification. Due to weak
temperature gradients in upper troposphere and a moist adiabat maintained in
the substellar region, variations in the substellar surface temperature and
specific humidity govern the increase of the planet's stratification with
warming. This suggests a scaling of nightside's precipitation based on the
substellar surface thermodynamic changes, a sensitivity that holds over a wider
range of stellar irradiance changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04172v1

Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios) utilised by the IPCC. These two
scenarios are the emissions trend under peak fossil fuel (for example, Mohr et
al., 2015); and the climate sensitivity determinable from the relationship
between first-difference CO2 and temperature recently shown by Leggett and Ball
(2015). This paper provides forecasts of a global surface temperature
trajectory to 2100 resulting from the effect of these two scenarios. The
time-series models developed both displayed high statistical significance and
converged in their forecasts, so adding to the potential robustness of the
findings. Under the effect of the combination of the peak fossil fuel and
first-difference CO2 scenarios, we found that temperature is forecast to
continue to rise, but only gently, until around 2023 where it reaches a level
slightly higher than at present; and from then to display an also gentle steady
decrease. It is shown that this trajectory is markedly lower than that
generated by the IPCC business-as-usual level-of-CO2 (RCP8.5) model (Riahi et
al. 2011). These lower results are evidence that the climate problem may
require less future preventative action than is presently being considered
necessary. If so, it is stressed that the same evidence is support for the case
that the peak fossil fuel problem would require ameliorative action. This
globally required action is the same as it would have been for climate (as
embodied in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change of the 21st Conference of the

environmental processes, such as land and sea surface temperature, in a

variation in the seasonal temperature cycle. However, an often overlooked
feature of the climate seasonal cycle is the semi-annual harmonic, which can
account for a significant portion of the variance of the seasonal cycle and
varies in amplitude and phase across space. Together, the spatial variation in
the annual and semi-annual harmonics can play an important role in driving
processes that are tied to seasonality (e.g., ecological and agricultural
processes). We propose a multivariate spatio-temporal model to quantify the
spatial and temporal change in minimum and maximum temperature seasonal cycles
as a function of the annual and semi-annual harmonics. Our approach captures
spatial dependence, temporal dynamics, and multivariate dependence of these
harmonics through spatially and temporally-varying coefficients. We apply the
model to minimum and maximum temperature over North American for the years 1979

In this paper the cycles are calculated from first principles, without any
reliance on computer simulation. The problem is one of planetary precession,
and is solvable by the methods used to study the precession of a spinning top.
It is shown that the main component of Milankovitch cycles has a period of
41,000 years and is due to one of the modes of precession of the Earth-Venus
system. The other mode of this system produces a component of period 29,500
years, and a third component of period 54,000 years results from the influence
of the precession of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.
  These results agree closely with several of the numerical simulations in the
literature, and strongly suggest that other different results in the literature
are incorrect.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03985v3

  localized climate impacts",2020-12-11T11:21:00Z,"Christian Requena-Mesa, Vitus Benson, Joachim Denzler, Jakob Runge, Markus Reichstein","Climate change is global, yet its concrete impacts can strongly vary between
different locations in the same region. Seasonal weather forecasts currently
operate at the mesoscale (> 1 km). For more targeted mitigation and adaptation,
modelling impacts to < 100 m is needed. Yet, the relationship between driving
variables and Earth's surface at such local scales remains unresolved by
current physical models. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to
create machine learning models capable of translating coarse weather
information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts. Here, we define
high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite
imagery conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been
tackled with deep learning models. Developing such models requires
analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset
containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m
resolution, matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale (1.28 km)
weather variables. With over 32000 samples it is suitable for training deep
neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial.
Hence, we define the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for models
forecasting Earth surface reflectance. For model intercomparison we frame
EarthNet2021 as a challenge with four tracks based on different test sets.
These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model
applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In
addition to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through
satellite-derived vegetation indices, capable Earth surface models will enable
downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health
assessments, coastline management, or biodiversity monitoring. Find data, code,

  with forced speed",2020-04-23T09:35:42Z,"Juliette Bouhours, Thomas Giletti","Invasion phenomena for heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equations are
contemporary and challenging questions in applied mathematics. In this paper we
are interested in the question of spreading for a reaction-diffusion equation
when the subdomain where the reaction term is positive is shifting/contracting
at a given speed $c$. This problem arises in particular in the modelling of the
impact of climate change on population dynamics. By placing ourselves in the
appropriate moving frame, this leads us to consider a
reaction-diffusion-advection equation with a heterogeneous in space reaction
term, in dimension $N\geq1$. We investigate the behaviour of the solution $u$
depending on the value of the advection constant~$c$, which typically stands
for the velocity of climate change. We find that, when the initial datum is
compactly supported, there exists precisely three ranges for $c$ leading to
drastically different situations. In the lower speed range the solution always
spreads, while in the upper range it always vanishes. More surprisingly, we
find that that both spreading and vanishing may occur in an intermediate speed
range. The threshold between those two outcomes is always sharp, both with
respect to $c$ and to the initial condition. We also briefly consider the case
of an exponentially decreasing initial condition, where we relate the
decreasing rate of the initial condition with the range of values of~$c$ such
that spreading occurs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11042v1

  Changing with Event Magnitude",2020-06-02T12:40:44Z,"Peng Zhong, Raphaël Huser, Thomas Opitz","The modeling of spatio-temporal trends in temperature extremes can help
better understand the structure and frequency of heatwaves in a changing
climate. Here, we study annual temperature maxima over Southern Europe using a
century-spanning dataset observed at 44 monitoring stations. Extending the
spectral representation of max-stable processes, our modeling framework relies
on a novel construction of max-infinitely divisible processes, which include
covariates to capture spatio-temporal non-stationarities. Our new model keeps a
popular max-stable process on the boundary of the parameter space, while
flexibly capturing weakening extremal dependence at increasing quantile levels
and asymptotic independence. This is achieved by linking the overall magnitude
of a spatial event to its spatial correlation range, in such a way that more
extreme events become less spatially dependent, thus more localized. Our model
reveals salient features of the spatio-temporal variability of European
temperature extremes, and it clearly outperforms natural alternative models.
Results show that the spatial extent of heatwaves is smaller for more severe
events at higher altitudes, and that recent heatwaves are moderately wider. Our

describe the importance of inertia to continued growth in energy consumption.
Drawing from thermodynamic arguments, and using 38 years of available
statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a persistent time-independent scaling
between the historical time integral $W$ of world inflation-adjusted economic
production $Y$, or $W\left(t\right) = \int_0^t Y\left(t'\right)dt'$, and
current rates of world primary energy consumption $\mathcal E$, such that
$\lambda = \mathcal{E}/W = 5.9\pm0.1$ Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars.
This empirical result implies that population expansion is a symptom rather
than a cause of the current exponential rise in $\mathcal E$ and carbon dioxide
emissions $C$, and that it is past innovation of economic production efficiency
$Y/\mathcal{E}$ that has been the primary driver of growth, at predicted rates

rapid decarbonization of $\mathcal E$ through sustained implementation of over
one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively,
assuming continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a
steady-state economy that devotes economic production exclusively to
maintenance rather than expansion. If this were instituted immediately,
continual energy consumption would still be required, so atmospheric carbon

the climate of tidally-locked Earth-like exoplanets, Trappist-1e and Proxima
Centauri b, to the choice of a convection parameterization. Compared to a
mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment
parameterization leads to a $>$60% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the
mean day-side temperature by $\approx$10 K. The representation of convection
also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in
planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment
scheme makes the night-side cold traps warmer by 17-36 K for the planets in our
simulations. The day-night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation
of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when
interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment,
however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure
from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and
planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the
Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water
cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments,
in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest
that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation the surface

relatively small atmospheric vortices that form mostly over the ocean in high
latitudes. PLs can strongly influence deep ocean water formation since they are
associated with strong surface winds and heat fluxes. Detection and tracking of
PLs are crucial for understanding the climatological dynamics of PLs and for
the analysis of their impacts on other components of the climatic system. At
the same time, visual tracking of PLs is a highly time-consuming procedure that
requires expert knowledge and extensive examination of source data.
  There are known procedures involving deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) for the detection of large-scale atmospheric phenomena in reanalysis
data that demonstrate a high quality of detection. However, one cannot apply
these procedures to satellite data directly since, unlike reanalyses, satellite
products register all the scales of atmospheric vortices. It is also known that
DCNNs were originally designed to be scale-invariant. This leads to the problem
of filtering the scale of detected phenomena. There are other problems to be
solved, such as a low signal-to-noise ratio of satellite data and an unbalanced
number of negative (without PLs) and positive (where a PL is presented) classes
in a satellite dataset.

select potentially habitable planets for follow up spectroscopic observation.
Given its importance, the precise size and location of the habitable zone
remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have
assessed various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and
planetary mass. However, little work has assessed how the habitable zone
changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure, which is directly
connected to the habitability and life bearing potential of planets. Here, I
use an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our solar system
habitable zone is about 0.9 to 1.7 AU, assuming a 5 bar nitrogen background
pressure and a maximum 100 percent cloud cover at the inner edge. This width is
about 20 percent wider than the conservative habitable zone estimate. Similar
extensions are calculated for A to M stars. I also show that cooling clouds and
hazes and high background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse
threshold temperature to approximately 300 K (or less) for planets orbiting any
star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables
stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be
triggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for
planets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates
at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway greenhouse above
approximately 330 K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with
previous work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting
A-stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00229v1
"""Perchance to dream?"": Assessing effect of dispersal strategies on the

fundamental basics of biogeography, tracking range shifts resulting from
climate change, predicting and preventing biological invansions. Many
researchers have modeled animals' dispersal studying their behavior under the
assumptions of some movement strategies pre-determined or affected by some
external factor(s) but none of them have compared the efficiency of different
dispersal strategies in providing population survival and fitness. We
hypothesize that 1) successful expansion could result from some evolutionary
stable strategy (ESS) and 2) such strategy could be based particularly on
deferred gain, when animals invest in travel to reach some high-quality habitat
(""habitat of dream""). Using simulation model we compare the ecological success
of three strategies: i) ""Smart"" - choosing the locally optimal cell; ii)
""Random"" - random movement between cells without taking into account the
quality of the environment; iii) ""Dreamer"" - movements that aims to find ""a
habitat of dream"" with quality much higher than that of the initial and
neighboring cells. The population fitness was measured as survival rate,
dispersal distance, accumulated energy and quality of settled habitat. The most
general conclusion is that while survival and wealth of the population is
affected presumably by overall habitat quality, the dispersal depends mainly on
the behavioral strategy. The ""Dreamer"" strategy or the strategy of deferred
gain belongs to the Pareto frontier in the Fitness$\times$Dispersal space but

multi-model ensemble methods such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) embedded
with the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. BMA is a popular method
for combining the forecasts of individual simulation models by weighted
averaging and characterizing the uncertainty induced by simulating the model
structure. This method is referred to as the GEV-embedded BMA. It is, however,
based on a point-wise analysis of extreme events, which means it overlooks the
spatial dependency between nearby grid cells. Instead of a point-wise model, a
spatial extreme model such as the max-stable process (MSP) is often employed to
improve precision by considering spatial dependency. We propose an approach
that integrates the MSP into BMA, which is referred to as the MSP-BMA herein.
The superiority of the proposed method over the GEV-embedded BMA is

multidimensional state measurements. These devices often operate in distinct

prevent complete or partial system outage, we would like to recognize as early
as possible when these devices begin to operate outside the normal modes.
Unfortunately, it is often impractical or impossible to predict failures using
rules or supervised machine learning, because failure modes are too complex,
devices are too new to adequately characterize in a specific environment, or
environmental change puts the device into an unpredictable condition. We
propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that creates a negative sample
from the positive, observed sample, and trains a classifier to distinguish
between positive and negative samples. Using the Contraction Principle, we
explain why such a classifier ought to establish suitable decision boundaries
between normal and anomalous regions, and show how Integrated Gradients can
attribute the anomaly to specific variables within the anomalous state vector.
We have demonstrated that negative sampling with random forest or neural

  Rainfall",2020-08-20T17:27:59Z,"Rilwan Adewoyin, Peter Dueben, Peter Watson, Yulan He, Ritabrata Dutta","Climate models (CM) are used to evaluate the impact of climate change on the
risk of floods and strong precipitation events. However, these numerical
simulators have difficulties representing precipitation events accurately,
mainly due to limited spatial resolution when simulating multi-scale dynamics
in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation
we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the
model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable than local
precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an
encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between
contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale
spatio-temporal weather processes. We use a conditional-continuous loss
function to capture the zero-skewed %extreme event patterns of rainfall.
Experiments show that our model consistently attains lower RMSE and MAE scores
than a DL model prevalent in short term precipitation prediction and improves
upon the rainfall predictions of a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model.
Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various, training
and testing, data formulation strategies, we show that there is enough data for
our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across

assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between
them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken
from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and Upwork workers---as well as 2
expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news

public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences
in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and
political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned
to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication.
Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert
criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may
contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the

Investigating Ground-level Ozone Formation: A Case Study in Taiwan,2020-12-18T05:41:42Z,"Yu-Wen Chen, Sourav Medya, Yi-Chun Chen","Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a greenhouse gas which can absorb heat and make
the weather even hotter during extreme heatwaves. Besides, it is an influential
ground-level air pollutant which can severely damage the environment. Thus
evaluating the importance of various factors related to the O3 formation
process is essential. However, O3 simulated by the available climate models
exhibits large variance in different places, indicating the insufficiency of
models in explaining the O3 formation process correctly. In this paper, we aim
to identify and understand the impact of various factors on O3 formation and
predict the O3 concentrations under different pollution-reduced and climate
change scenarios. We employ six supervised methods to estimate the observed O3
using fourteen meteorological and chemical variables. We find that the deep
neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) based models can predict
O3 concentrations accurately. We also demonstrate the importance of several
variables in this prediction task. The results suggest that while Nitrogen
Oxides negatively contributes to predicting O3, solar radiation makes a
significantly positive contribution. Furthermore, we apply our two best models

"Impact of solar magnetic field amplitude and geometry on cosmic rays
  diffusion coefficients in the inner heliosphere",2020-10-05T09:29:09Z,"Barbara Perri, Allan Sacha Brun, Antoine Strugarek, Victor Réville","Cosmic rays (CRs) are tracers of solar events when they are associated with
solar flares, but also galactic events when they come from outside our solar
system. SEPs are correlated with the 11-year solar cycle while GCRs are
anti-correlated due to their interaction with the heliospheric magnetic field
and the solar wind. Our aim is to quantify separately the impact of the
amplitude and the geometry of the magnetic field on the propagation of CRs of
various energies in the inner heliosphere. We focus especially on the diffusion
caused by the magnetic field along and across the field lines. To do so, we use
the results of 3D MHD wind simulations running from the lower corona up to 1
AU. The wind is modeled using a polytropic approximation, and fits and power
laws are used to account for the turbulence. Using these results, we compute
the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of the Parker CR
transport equation, yielding 3D maps of the diffusion of CRs in the inner
heliosphere. By varying the amplitude of the magnetic field, we change the
amplitude of the diffusion by the same factor, and the radial gradients by
changing the spread of the current sheet. By varying the geometry of the
magnetic field, we change the latitudinal gradients of diffusion by changing
the position of the current sheets. By varying the energy, we show that the
distribution of values for SEPs is more peaked than GCRs. For realistic solar
configurations, we show that diffusion is highly non-axisymmetric due to the
configuration of the current sheets, and that the distribution varies a lot
with the distance to the Sun with a drift of the peak value. This study shows
that numerical simulations and theory can help quantify better the influence of
the various magnetic field parameters on the propagation of CRs. This study is
a first step towards generating synthetic CR rates from numerical simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01880v1

measure of areas subjected to hydrological risk. The concept of persistence can
be assessed via clustering analyses, performed here to analyse the national
inventory of flash floods disasters in China occurred in the period 1950-2015.
Specifically, we investigated the spatio-temporal pattern distribution of the
flash floods and their clustering behavior by using both global and local
methods: the first, based on the Ripley's K-function, and the second on scan
statistics. As a result, we could visualize patterns of aggregated events,
estimate the cluster duration and make assumptions about their evolution over
time, also with respect precipitations trend. Due to the large spatial (the
whole Chinese territory) and temporal scale of the dataset (66 years), we were
able to capture whether certain clusters gather in specific locations and
times, but also whether their magnitude tends to increase or decrease. Overall,
the eastern regions in China are much more subjected to flash floods compared
to the rest of the country. Detected clusters revealed that these phenomena
predominantly occur between July and October, a period coinciding with the wet
season in China. The number of detected clusters increases with time, but the
associated duration drastically decreases in the recent period. This may
indicate a change towards triggering mechanisms which are typical of
short-duration extreme rainfall events. Finally, being flash floods directly
linked to precipitation and their extreme realization, we indirectly assessed
whether the magnitude of the trigger itself has also varied through space and

our previous review of Cassini's remote sensing investigations (2004-14,

record of Saturn's climate that spans almost half a Saturnian year, which can
be used to test the seasonal predictions of radiative climate models, neutral

asymmetries in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were observed to
reverse from northern winter to northern summer; spatial distributions of
hydrocarbons and para-hydrogen shifted in response to atmospheric dynamics
(e.g., seasonally-reversing Hadley cells, polar stratospheric vortex formation,
equatorial stratospheric oscillations, and inter-hemispheric transport); and
upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols exhibited changes in optical
thickness that modulated Saturn's visible colours (from blue hues to a golden
appearance in the north near solstice), reflectivity, and near-infrared
emission. Numerical simulations of radiative balance and photochemistry do a
good job in reproducing the observed seasonal change and phase lags, but
discrepancies between models and observations still persist, indicating a
crucial role for atmospheric dynamics and the need to couple chemical and

Finite Sample Smeariness of Fréchet Means and Application to Climate,2020-05-05T16:28:35Z,"Shayan Hundrieser, Benjamin Eltzner, Stephan F. Huckemann","Fr\'echet means on non-Euclidean spaces may exhibit nonstandard asymptotic
rates rendering quantile-based asymptotic inference inapplicable. We show here
that this affects, among others, all circular distributions whose support

FSS, it turns out that quantile-based tests for equality of Fr\'echet means
systematically feature effective levels higher than their nominal level which
perseveres asymptotically in case of Type I FSS. In contrast, suitable
bootstrap-based tests correct for FSS and asymptotically attain the correct
level. For illustration of the relevance of FSS in real data, we apply our
method to directional wind data from two European cities. It turns out that

change in the amount of these clouds. Through a novel analysis of detailed
numerical simulations in comparison to satellite data, we show that results
from ship-track studies cannot be generalized to estimate the climatological
forcing of anthropogenic aerosol. We specifically find that the
ship-track-derived sensitivity of the radiative effect of non-precipitating

Renewable Power Trades and Network Congestion Externalities,2020-05-28T19:23:50Z,"Nayara Aguiar, Indraneel Chakraborty, Vijay Gupta","Integrating renewable energy production into the electricity grid is an
important policy goal to address climate change. However, such an integration
faces economic and technological challenges. As power generation by renewable
sources increases, power transmission patterns over the electric grid change.
Due to physical laws, these new transmission patterns lead to non-intuitive
grid congestion externalities. We derive the conditions under which negative
network externalities due to power trades occur. Calibration using a stylized
framework and data from Europe shows that each additional unit of power traded
between northern and western Europe reduces transmission capacity for the
southern and eastern regions by 27% per unit traded. Such externalities suggest
that new investments in the electric grid infrastructure cannot be made
piecemeal. In our example, power infrastructure investment in northern and
western Europe needs an accompanying investment in southern and eastern Europe
as well. An economic challenge is regions facing externalities do not always
have the financial ability to invest in infrastructure. Power transit fares can
help finance power infrastructure investment in regions facing network
congestion externalities. The resulting investment in the overall electricity
grid facilitates integration of renewable energy production.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00916v2
"Multistability and rare spontaneous transitions in barotropic
  $β$-plane turbulence",2020-09-18T15:48:02Z,"Eric Simonnet, Joran Rolland, Freddy Bouchet","We demonstrate that turbulent zonal jets, analogous to Jovian ones, which are
quasi-stationary, are actually metastable. After extremely long times, they
randomly switch to new configurations with a different number of jets. The
genericity of this phenomenon suggests that most quasi-stationary turbulent
planetary atmospheres might have many climates and attractors for fixed values
of the external forcing parameters. A key message is that this situation will
usually not be detected by simply running the numerical models, because of the
extremely long mean transition time to change from one climate to another. In
order to study such phenomena, we need to use specific tools: rare event
algorithms and large deviation theory. With these tools, we make a full
statistical mechanics study of a classical barotropic beta-plane
quasigeostrophic model. It exhibits robust bimodality with abrupt transitions.
We show that new jets spontaneously nucleate from westward jets. The
numerically computed mean transition time is consistent with an Arrhenius law
showing an exponential decrease of the probability as the Ekman dissipation
decreases. This phenomenology is controlled by rare noise-driven paths called
{\it instantons}. Moreover, we compute the saddles of the corresponding
effective dynamics. For the dynamics of states with three alternating jets, we
uncover an unexpectedly rich dynamics governed by the symmetric group ${\cal
S}_3$ of permutations, with two distinct families of instantons, which is a
surprise for a system where everything seemed stationary in the hundreds of
previous simulations of this model. We discuss the future generalization of our

Aims. We seek to create a 20-year atmospheric database (1997 - 2017) for the
Chajnantor area in northern Chile using a single common physical unit, PWV.We
plan to extract weather relations between the Chajnantor Plateau and the summit
of Cerro Chajnantor to evaluate potential sensitivity improvements for
telescopes fielded in the higher site. We aim to validate the use of
submillimeter tippers to be used at other sites and use the PWV database to
detect a potential signature for local climate change over 20 years. Methods.
We revised our method to convert from submillimeter tipper opacity to PWV. We
now include the ground temperature as an input parameter to the conversion
scheme and, therefore, achieve a higher conversion accuracy. Results.We found a
decrease in the measured PWV at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor with respect to
the plateau of 28%. In addition, we found a PWV difference of 1:9% with only 27
m of altitude difference between two sites in the Chajnantor Plateau: the
Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)
near the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) center. This difference is
possibly due to local topographic conditions that favor the discrepancy in PWV.
The scale height for the plateau was extracted from the measurements of the
plateau and the Cerro Chajnantor summit, giving a value of 1537 m. Considering
the results obtained in this work from the long-term study, we do not see
evidence of PWV trends in the 20-year period of the analysis that would suggest

  severe local storm environments over North America",2020-07-31T02:05:01Z,"Funing Li, Daniel R. Chavas, Kevin A. Reed, Nan Rosenbloom, Daniel T. Dawson II","The prevailing conceptual model for the production of severe local storm
(SLS) environments over North America asserts that upstream elevated terrain
and the Gulf of Mexico are both essential to their formation. This work tests
this hypothesis using two prescribed-ocean climate model experiments with North
American topography removed or the Gulf of Mexico converted to land and
analyzes how SLS environments and associated synoptic-scale drivers (southerly
Great Plains low-level jets, drylines, elevated mixed layers, and extratropical
cyclones) change relative to a control historical run. Overall, SLS
environments depend strongly on upstream elevated terrain but weakly on the
Gulf of Mexico. Removing elevated terrain substantially reduces SLS
environments especially over the continental interior due to broad reductions
in both thermodynamic and kinematic parameters, leaving a more zonally-uniform
residual distribution that is maximized near the Gulf coast and decays toward
the continental interior. This response is associated with a strong reduction
in synoptic-scale drivers and a cooler and drier mean-state atmosphere.
Replacing the Gulf of Mexico with land modestly reduces SLS environments
thermodynamically over the Great Plains and increases them kinematically over
the eastern U.S, shifting the primary local maximum eastward into Illinois; it
also eliminates the secondary, smaller local maximum over southern Texas. This
response is associated with modest changes in synoptic-scale drivers and a
warmer and drier lower-tropospheric mean state. These experiments provide
insight into the role of elevated terrain and the Gulf of Mexico in modifying
the spatial distribution and seasonality of SLS environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15803v2

(RDA) equation forced by realistic surface velocities and nutrients is skilled
in reproducing the distributions of the surface phytoplankton chlorophyll in
the tropical Pacific. We use the low-complexity RDA model to investigate the
scale-relationships in the impact of different drivers (turbulent diffusion,
mean and eddy advection, primary productivity) on the phytoplankton chlorophyll
concentrations. We find that in the 1/4{\deg} (~25km) model, advection has a
substantial impact on the rate of primary productivity, whilst the turbulent
diffusion term has a fairly negligible impact. Turbulent diffusion has an
impact on the phytoplankton variability, with the impact being scale-propagated
and amplified by the larger scale surface currents. We investigate the impact
of a surface nutrient decline and some changes to mesoscale eddy kinetic energy
(climate change projections) on the surface phytoplankton concentrations. The
RDA model suggests that unless mesoscale eddies radically change, phytoplankton
chlorophyll scales sub-linearly with the nutrients, and it is relatively stable
with respect to the nutrient concentrations. Furthermore we explore how a white
multiplicative Gaussian noise introduced into the RDA model on its resolution
scale propagates across spatial scales through the non-linear model dynamics
under different sets of phytoplankton drivers. The unifying message of this
work is that the low complexity (e.g. RDA) models can be successfully used to
realistically model some specific aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and by
using those models one can explore many questions that would be beyond
computational affordability of the higher-complexity ecosystem models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03629v2
Surrogate sea ice model enables efficient tuning,2020-06-01T19:42:43Z,"Kelly Kochanski, Ivana Cvijanovic, Donald Lucas","Predicting changes in sea ice cover is critical for shipping, ecosystem
monitoring, and climate modeling. Current sea ice models, however, predict more
ice than is observed in the Arctic, and less in the Antarctic. Improving the
fit of these physics-based models to observations is challenging because the
models are expensive to run, and therefore expensive to optimize. Here, we
construct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing
model physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model
(CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to
changes in the parameters governing: ice's ridging and albedo; snow's albedo,
aging, and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the
effect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE's sensitivity to these model
parameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers
separate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal
and inter-hemispheric basis, and we recommend optimal values of these
parameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of
both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely. These results demonstrate that
important aspects of the behavior of a leading sea ice model can be captured by
a relatively simple support vector regression surrogate model, and that this
surrogate dramatically increases the ease of tuning the full simulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12977v1

ability to quickly predict traffic patterns in different scenarios has become
more urgent to support short-term operations and long-term transportation
planning. This requires modeling entire metropolitan areas to recognize the
upstream and downstream effects on the network. However, there is a well-known
trade-off between increasing the level of detail of a model and decreasing
computational performance. To achieve the level of detail required for traffic
microsimulation, current implementations often compromise by simulating small
spatial scales, and those that operate at larger scales often require access to
expensive high-performance computing systems or have computation times on the
order of days or weeks that discourage productive research and real-time
planning. This paper addresses the performance shortcomings by introducing a
new platform, MANTA (Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment),
for traffic microsimulation at the metropolitan-scale. MANTA employs a highly
parallelized GPU implementation that is capable of running metropolitan-scale
simulations within a few minutes. The runtime to simulate all morning trips,
using half-second timesteps, for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area is just
over four minutes, not including routing and initialization. This computational
performance significantly improves the state of the art in large-scale traffic

  by social dynamics?",2020-12-03T14:55:30Z,"Paul Manuel Müller, Jobst Heitzig, Jürgen Kurths, Kathy Lüdge, Marc Wiedermann","In the past decades human activities caused global Earth system changes,
e.g., climate change or biodiversity loss. Simultaneously, these associated
impacts have increased environmental awareness within societies across the
globe, thereby leading to dynamical feedbacks between the social and natural
Earth system. Contemporary modelling attempts of Earth system dynamics rarely
incorporate such co-evolutions and interactions are mostly studied
unidirectionally through direct or remembered past impacts. Acknowledging that
societies have the additional capability for foresight, this work proposes a
conceptual feedback model of socio-ecological co-evolution with the specific
construct of anticipation acting as a mediator between the social and natural
system. Our model reproduces results from previous sociological threshold
models with bi-stability if one assumes a static environment. Once the
environment changes in response to societal behaviour the system instead
converges towards a globally stable, but not necessarily desired, attractor.
Ultimately, we show that anticipation of future ecological states then leads to
metastability of the system where desired states can persist for a long time.
We thereby demonstrate that foresight and anticipation form an important
mechanism which, once its time horizon becomes large enough, fosters social
tipping towards behaviour that can stabilise the environment and prevents
potential socio-ecological collapse.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01977v1

  Idealized and Neretva River Estuary",2020-01-14T13:31:22Z,"Nino Krvavica, Igor Ružić","Understanding the response of estuaries to sea-level rise is crucial in
developing a suitable mitigation and climate change adaptation strategy. This
study investigates the impacts of rising sea levels on salinity intrusion in
salt-wedge estuaries. The sea-level rise impacts are assessed in idealized
estuaries using simple expressions derived from a two-layer hydraulic theory,
and in the Neretva River Estuary in Croatia using a two-layer time-dependent
model. The assessment is based on three indicators - the salt-wedge intrusion
length, the seawater volume, and the river inflows needed to restore the
baseline intrusion. The potential SLR was found to increase all three
considered indicators. Theoretical analysis in idealized estuaries suggests
that shallower estuaries are more sensitive to SLR. Numerical results for the
Neretva River Estuary showed that SLR may increase salt-wedge intrusion length,
volume, and corrective river inflow. However, the results are highly non-linear
because of the channel geometry, especially for lower river inflows. A
theoretical assessment of channel bed slope impacts on limiting a potential
intrusion is therefore additionally discussed. This findings emphasize the need
to use several different indicators when assessing SLR impacts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04765v1
Prediction of Bayesian Intervals for Tropical Storms,2020-03-10T22:31:58Z,"Max Chiswick, Sam Ganzfried","Building on recent research for prediction of hurricane trajectories using
recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we have developed improved methods and

accurately predicting their trajectories can bring significant benefits to
cities and lives, especially as they grow more intense due to climate change

improve the actionability of the predictions, for example by estimating the
areas to evacuate in the landfall region. We used an RNN to predict the
trajectory of the storms at 6-hour intervals. We used latitude, longitude,

too expensive (on-ground inspection of forest) or inaccurate (satellite).
Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining

individuals interact asymmetrically according to their leader/follower status.
As the angular velocities of the oscillators are updated, the leader and

Evidence for increasing frequency of extreme coastal sea levels,2020-06-11T20:39:54Z,"Tony E. Wong, Travis Torline, Mingxuan Zhang","Projections of extreme sea levels (ESLs) are critical for managing coastal
risks, but are made complicated by deep uncertainties. One key uncertainty is
the choice of model structure used to estimate coastal hazards. Differences in
model structural choices contribute to uncertainty in estimated coastal hazard,
so it is important to characterize how model structural choice affects
estimates of ESL. Here, we present a collection of 36 ESL data sets, from tide
gauge stations along the United States East and Gulf Coasts. The data are
processed using both annual block maxima and peaks-over-thresholds approaches

statistics with multiple climate variables. We demonstrate how this data set
enables inquiry into deep uncertainty surrounding coastal hazards. For all of

using new materials and approaches in detector conception and operation for the
reduction of gas flow rates.
  Along this line of work, we present here an RPC architecture aimed at a

"Improving Piecewise Linear Snow Density Models through Hierarchical
  Spatial and Orthogonal Functional Smoothing",2020-06-16T17:11:03Z,"Philip White, Durban Keeler, Daniel Sheanshang, Summer Rupper","Snow density estimates as a function of depth are used for understanding
climate processes, evaluating water accumulation trends in polar regions, and
estimating glacier mass balances. The common and interpretable
physically-derived differential equation models for snow density are piecewise
linear as a function of depth (on a transformed scale); thus, they can fail to
capture important data features. Moreover, the differential equation parameters
show strong spatial autocorrelation. To address these issues, we allow the
parameters of the physical model, including random change points over depth, to
vary spatially. We also develop a framework for functionally smoothing the
physically-motivated model. To preserve inference on the interpretable physical
model, we project the smoothing function into the physical model's spatially
varying null space. The proposed spatially and functionally smoothed snow
density model better fits the data while preserving inference on physical
parameters. Using this model, we find significant spatial variation in the
parameters that govern snow densification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09329v3

enablers for climate change mitigation measures. They can make existing
products and activities more efficient or substitute them altogether.
Consequently, different initiatives have started to estimate the environmental
effects of ICT services. Such assessments, however, lack scientific rigor and
often rely on crude assumptions and methods, leading to inaccurate or even
misleading results. The few methodological attempts that exist do not address
several crucial aspects, and are thus insufficient to foster good as-sessment
practice. Starting from such a high level standard from the European
Telecommunication Standardisation Institute (ETSI) and the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), this article identifies the shortcomings of
existing methodologies and proposes solutions. It addresses several aspects for
the assessment of single ICT services: the goal and scope definition (analyzing
differences between ICT substitution and optimization, the time perspective of
the assessment, the challenge of a hypothetical baseline for the situation
without the ICT solution, and the differences between modelling and case
studies) as well as the often ignored influence of rebound effects and the

HydroNets: Leveraging River Structure for Hydrologic Modeling,2020-07-01T16:32:07Z,"Zach Moshe, Asher Metzger, Gal Elidan, Frederik Kratzert, Sella Nevo, Ran El-Yaniv","Accurate and scalable hydrologic models are essential building blocks of
several important applications, from water resource management to timely flood

pattern variations become more extreme, and accurate training data that can
account for the resulting distributional shifts become more scarce. In this
work we present a novel family of hydrologic models, called HydroNets, which
leverages river network structure. HydroNets are deep neural network models
designed to exploit both basin specific rainfall-runoff signals, and upstream
network dynamics, which can lead to improved predictions at longer horizons.
The injection of the river structure prior knowledge reduces sample complexity

barometer for evaluating population health and extinction risk. A fundamental
assumption is that higher levels of genetic diversity lead to an increase in

perceived importance of neutral genetic diversity for the conservation of wild

Instead, a better understanding of the properties of functional genetic

subsequent increases in property losses. Thus, insurance policies should be
modified to endure increasingly volatile catastrophic weather events. We
propose a Natural Disasters Index (NDI) for the property losses caused by
natural disasters in the United States based on the ""Storm Data"" published by

available for primary energy consumption (PEC) and Gross Domestic Product

macroeconomic model whereby physical power is fueling economic power. From 1820
to 1920, the linearity between global PEC and world GDP justifies basic
equations where, originally, PEC incorporates unskilled human labor that
consumes and converts energy from food. In a consistent model, both physical
capital and human capital are fed by PEC and represent a form of stored energy.
In the following century, from 1920 to 2016, GDP grows quicker than PEC.
Periods of quasi-linearity of the two variables are separated by distinct
jumps, which can be interpreted as radical technology shifts. The GDP to PEC
ratio accumulates game-changing innovation, at an average growth rate
proportional to PEC. These results seed alternative strategies for modeling and

  This paper proposes a tree-based Machine Learning (ML) approach to analyze
the role of the weather shocks towards an individual's intention to migrate in
the six agriculture-dependent-economy countries such as Burkina Faso, Ivory
Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. We perform several tree-based
algorithms (e.g., XGB, Random Forest) using the train-validation-test workflow

features showing in which direction they are influencing the migration
intention. This ML-based estimation accounts for features such as weather
shocks captured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index

  We find that (i) weather features improve the prediction performance although

more by the longer timescales of SPEIs while general move (which includes
internal move) by that of shorter timescales.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02794v1

Global to local impacts on atmospheric CO2 caused by COVID-19 lockdown,2020-10-25T03:40:50Z,"Ning Zeng, Pengfei Han, Di Liu, Zhiqiang Liu, Tomohiro Oda, Cory Martin, Zhu Liu, Bo Yao, Wanqi Sun, Pucai Wang, Qixiang Cai, Russell Dickerson, Shamil Maksyutov","The world-wide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in year 2020 led
to economic slowdown and large reduction of fossil fuel CO2 emissions, but it
is unclear how much it would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration, and whether
it can be observed. We estimated that a 7.9% reduction in emissions for 4
months would result in a 0.25 ppm decrease in the Northern Hemisphere CO2, an
increment that is within the capability of current CO2 analyzers, but is a few
times smaller than natural CO2 variabilities caused by weather and the
biosphere such as El Nino. We used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport
model to simulate CO2, driven by a new daily fossil fuel emissions dataset and
hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced with observed climate
variability. Our results show a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric column CO2
anomaly averaged over 50S-50N for the period February-April 2020 relative to a
10-year climatology. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon satellite
GOSAT3. Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that COVID, the
biosphere and weather contributed 54%, 23%, and 23% respectively. This
seemingly small change stands out as the largest sub-annual anomaly in the last
10 years. Measurements from global ground stations were analyzed. At city
scale, on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows reduction of 20-30
ppm, consistent with drastically reduced traffic during the lockdown. The
ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and
short-lasting COVID signal on the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated
over the last two centuries is encouraging. The COVID-19 pandemic is an
unintended experiment whose impact suggests that to keep atmospheric CO2 at a
climate-safe level will require sustained effort of similar magnitude and
improved accuracy and expanded spatiotemporal coverage of our monitoring

to assess how tree species type (broadleaf vs. conifer), mycorrhizal
association (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vs. ectomycorrhizal (ECM)), and
N-fixing ability (N-fixing vs. non-N-fixing), directly and indirectly, affect
topsoil (with a median depth of 10 cm) C concentration and stock, and how such

how tree species and their specific traits influence forest floor C stock and

located above typical convective cells ($\sim$ 250 Pa) and the effect of GW on
the circulation and predicted thermal structure above 1 Pa ($\sim$ 50 km) is
analyzed. We focus on the comparison between model simulations and observations
by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during
Martian Year 29. MCS data provide the only systematic measurements of the
Martian mesosphere up to 80 km to date. The primary effect of GW is to damp the
thermal tides by reducing the diurnal oscillation of the meridional and zonal
winds. The GW drag reaches magnitudes of the order of 1 m/s/sol above 10$^{-2}$
Pa in the northern hemisphere winter solstice and produces major changes in the
zonal wind field (from tens to hundreds of m/s), while the impact on the
temperature field is relatively moderate (10-20K). It suggests that GW induced
alteration of the meridional flow is the main responsible for the simulated
temperature variation. The results also show that with the GW scheme included,
the maximum day-night temperature difference due to the diurnal tide is around
10K, and the peak of the tide is shifted toward lower altitudes, in better
agreement with MCS observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00723v1

coming decades in response to major climate and economics drivers: CCS is part
of every clean energy pathway that limits global warming to 2C or less and
receives significant CO2 tax credits in the United States. These drivers are
likely to stimulate capture, transport, and storage of hundreds of millions or
billions of tonnes of CO2 annually. A key part of the CCS puzzle will be
identifying and characterizing suitable storage sites for vast amounts of CO2.
We introduce a new software tool called SCO2T (Sequestration of CO2 Tool,

tool is designed to rapidly screen hundreds of thousands of reservoirs, perform
sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, and link sequestration engineering
(injection rates, reservoir capacities, plume dimensions) to sequestration
economics (costs constructed from around 70 separate economic inputs). We
describe the novel science developments supporting SCO2T including a new
approach to estimating CO2 injection rates and CO2 plume dimensions as well as
key advances linking sequestration engineering with economics. Next, we perform
a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of geology combinations (including
formation depth, thickness, permeability, porosity, and temperature) to
understand the impact on carbon sequestration. Through the sensitivity analysis
we show that increasing depth and permeability both can lead to increased CO2
injection rates, increased storage potential, and reduced costs, while
increasing porosity reduces costs without impacting the injection rate (CO2 is
injected at a constant pressure in all cases) by increasing the reservoir
capacity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13688v1

use a simple formulation of an energy balance model that includes the
vegetation coverage to investigate the possibility of life affecting the
climate of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Results confirm that planet
T-e has the best chance for a habitable world and indicate that vegetation

scenarios characterized by different vegetation types, land-sea distributions
and levels of greenhouse effect. While changes in vegetation type produce small
changes, about $0.1\%$, in the habitable surface fraction, different land-sea

focused on variance metrics for early warning signals of abrupt system change.
Despite this, the theoretical foundation and application has been limited to
relatively simple system changes such as bifurcating fixed points where
variability is extrinsic to the steady state. There is currently no foundation
and associated metric for empirically exploring stability in wide ranging
systems that contain variability in both internal steady state dynamics and in
response to external perturbations. Utilizing connections between stability,
dissipation, and phase space flow, we show that stability correlates with
temporal asymmetry in a measure of phase space flow contraction. Our method is
general as it reveals stability variation independent of assumptions about the
nature of system variability or attractor shape. After showing efficacy in a
variety of model systems, we apply our technique for measuring stability to
monthly returns of the S&P 500 index in the time periods surrounding the global
stock market crash of October 1987. Market stability is shown to be higher in
the several years preceding and subsequent to the 1987 market crash. We

Sparse Regression for Extreme Values,2020-07-08T21:24:49Z,"Andersen Chang, Minjie Wang, Genevera Allen","We study the problem of selecting features associated with extreme values in
high dimensional linear regression. Normally, in linear modeling problems, the
presence of abnormal extreme values or outliers is considered an anomaly which
should either be removed from the data or remedied using robust regression
methods. In many situations, however, the extreme values in regression modeling
are not outliers but rather the signals of interest; consider traces from
spiking neurons, volatility in finance, or extreme events in climate science,
for example. In this paper, we propose a new method for sparse high-dimensional
linear regression for extreme values which is motivated by the Subbotin, or
generalized normal distribution, which we call the extreme value linear
regression model. For our method, we utilize an $\ell_p$ norm loss where $p$ is
an even integer greater than two; we demonstrate that this loss increases the
weight on extreme values. We prove consistency and variable selection
consistency for the extreme value linear regression with a Lasso penalty, which
we term the Extreme Lasso, and we also analyze the theoretical impact of
extreme value observations on the model parameter estimates using the concept
of influence functions. Through simulation studies and a real-world data
example, we show that the Extreme Lasso outperforms other methods currently
used in the literature for selecting features of interest associated with

Symmetric and antisymmetric components of polar-amplified warming,2020-12-16T19:47:20Z,"Spencer A. Hill, Natalie J. Burls, Alexey Fedorov, Timothy M. Merlis","CO$_2$-forced surface warming in general circulation models (GCMs) is
initially polar-amplified in the Arctic but not Antarctic -- a largely

LongRunMIP GCMs that the hemispherically symmetric component of
global-mean-normalized, zonal-mean warming ($T^*_\mathrm{sym}$) under
4\(\times\)CO$_2$ changes weakly or becomes moderately more polar-amplified
from the first decade to near-equilibrium. Conversely, the antisymmetric
warming component ($T^*_\mathrm{asym}$) weakens with time in all models,
moderately in some including FAMOUS but effectively vanishing in others
including CESM1. We explore mechanisms underlying the robust $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$
behavior with a diffusive moist energy balance model (MEBM), which given
radiative feedback parameter ($\lambda$) and ocean heat uptake ($\mathcal{O}$)
fields diagnosed from CESM1 adequately reproduces the CESM1 $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$

$\lambda$ and $\mathcal{O}$, $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ is sensitive to their symmetric
components only, and more to that of $\lambda$. A three-box, two-timescale
model fitted to FAMOUS and CESM1 reveals a curiously short Antarctic
fast-response timescale in FAMOUS. In additional CESM1 simulations spanning a
broader range of forcings, $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ changes modestly across
2-16\(\times\)CO$_2$, and $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ in a Pliocene-like simulation is
more polar-amplified but likewise approximately time-invariant. Determining the
real-world relevance of these behaviors -- which imply that a surprising amount
of information about near-equilibrium polar amplification emerges within

worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the
magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region,
climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by
these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the
Generalised Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and
prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series
analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to
medium to large wildfires ($>$ 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span
of two decades (1996--2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual
vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify
abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting
vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions
to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its
predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire
periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from $R^2 = 0.66$ to
$R^2 = 0.93$ in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from $R^2 =
0.48$ to $R^2 = 0.81$ for Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), and from $R^2 = 0.49$ to
$R^2 = 0.85$ for Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show
greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as
having a lower Burning Index. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects
on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases
never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period.
Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05140v3
Diurnal Self-Aggregation,2020-01-14T12:31:22Z,"Jan O. Haerter, Bettina Meyer, Silas Boye Nissen","Convective self-aggregation is a modelling paradigm for thunderstorm
organisation over a constant-temperature tropical sea surface. This setup can
give rise to cloud clusters over timescales of weeks. In reality, sea surface
temperatures do oscillate diurnally, affecting the atmospheric state. Over
land, surface temperatures vary more strongly, and rain rate is significantly
influenced. Here, we carry out a substantial suite of cloud-resolving numerical
experiments, and find that even weak surface temperature oscillations enable
qualitatively different dynamics to emerge: the spatial distribution of
rainfall is only homogeneous during the first day. Already on the second day,
the rain field is firmly structured. In later days, the clustering becomes
stronger and alternates from day-to-day. We show that these features are robust
to changes in resolution, domain size, and surface temperature, but can be
removed by a reduction of the amplitude of oscillation, suggesting a transition
to a clustered state. Maximal clustering occurs at a scale of
$\mathbf{l_{max}\approx 180\;km}$, a scale we relate to the emergence of
mesoscale convective systems. At $\mathbf{l_{max}}$ rainfall is strongly
enhanced and far exceeds the rainfall expected at random. We explain the
transition to clustering using simple conceptual modelling. Our results may
help clarify how continental extremes build up and how cloud clustering over
the tropical ocean could emerge much faster than through conventional
self-aggregation alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04740v1

develop methods that enable snow density estimation with uncertainty in regions

  In inland West Antarctica, snow density increases monotonically as a function
of depth, except for possible micro-scale variability or measurement error, and
it cannot exceed the density of ice. We present a novel class of integrated
spatial process models that allow interpolation of monotone snow density
curves. For computational feasibility, we construct the space-depth process
through kernel convolutions of log-Gaussian spatial processes. We discuss model
comparison, model fitting, and prediction. Using this model, we extend
estimates of snow density beyond the depth of the original core and estimate
snow density curves where snow cores have not been drilled. Along flight lines

significantly to the ENSO variability. According to introduce a
micro-correlation, we find that the coupling between the first principal mode
and the temperature fluctuations in the El Nino region could result in
different ENSO phases. Without this coupling, the El Nino region is in a normal
phase. With the strong coupling between the El Nino region and the Northern
Hemisphere, an El Nino event will appear with a high probability. Then this
coupling changes to be strong between the El Nino region and the Southern
Hemisphere accounting for the fast decay of El Nino after boreal winter, even
leading to a La Nina event. Moreover, the coupling between the El Nino region
and the second principal mode is found to be strong in normal or La Nina phases

change in line with the Paris Agreement and reaching the sustainable
development goal of eradicating poverty have been proposed recently. They imply
a strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively
halves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of
these scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted
international inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global
inequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a
new dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In
both cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially
attributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the
distribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These
results show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an
unprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels.
Moreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to
2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5.
This observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy
reasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This
saturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios,
which are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon
footprint inequality under global capitalism. One way out of this conundrum is
a fast decarbonization of the global energy supply in order to decrease global
carbon emissions without relying crucially on carbon inequality reduction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00111v1

A graph-based formulation for modeling macro-energy systems,2020-04-21T17:47:23Z,Leonard Göke,"Averting the impending harms of climate change requires to replace fossil
fuels with renewables as a primary source of energy. Non-electric renewable
potential being limited, this implies extending the use of electricity

energy system is challenging, because it imposes to consider fluctuations of
wind and solar and the manifold ways the demand side could adjust to these
fluctuations.
  This paper introduces a graph-based method to formulate energy system models
to address these challenges. By organizing sets in rooted trees, two features
to facilitate modeling high shares of renewables and sector integration are
enabled. First, the method allows the level of temporal and spatial detail to
be varied by energy carrier. This enables modeling with a high level of detail
and a large scope, while keeping models computationally tractable. Second, the
degree to which energy carriers are substitutable when converted, stored,

rapidly. This is especially critical for the high-altitude carbon cycle, for
which new feedbacks could be triggered. However, mountain carbon dynamics is
only partially known. In particular, models of the processes driving carbon
fluxes in high-altitude grasslands and Alpine tundra need to be improved. Here,
we propose a comparison of three empirical approaches using systematic
statistical analysis, to identify the environmental variables controlling
$CO_2$ fluxes. The methods were applied to a complete dataset of simultaneous
in situ measurements of the net $CO_2$ exchange, ecosystem respiration and
basic environmental variables in three sampling sites in the same catchment.
Large year-to-year variations in the gross primary production (GPP) and
ecosystem respiration (ER) dependences on solar irradiance and temperature were
observed,. We thus implemented a multi regression model in which additional
variables were introduced as perturbations of the standard exponential and
rectangular hyperbolic functions for ER and GPP, respectively. A comparison of
this model with other common modelling strategies, showed the benefits of this
approach, resulting in large explained variances (83% to 94%). The optimum
ensemble of variables explaining the inter- and intra-annual flux variability
included solar irradiance, soil moisture and day of the year for GPP, and air
temperature, soil moisture, air pressure and day of the year for the ER, in
agreement with other studies. The modelling approach discussed here provides a
basis for selecting drivers of carbon fluxes and understanding their role in
high-altitude Alpine ecosystems, also allowing for future short-range
assessments of local trends.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14262v1

through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) while enabling negative carbon dioxide
emissions is evaluated in this paper, looking into the potential of the process
in the context of negative emission technologies (NETs) for climate change
mitigation. In the HTL process, a gas phase consisting mainly of carbon dioxide
is obtained as a side product driving a potential for the implementation of
carbon capture and storage in the process (BECCS) that has not been explored
yet in the existing literature and is undertaken in this study. To this end,
the process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on,
having forestry residues as feedstock. The Selexol technology is adapted in a
novel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover
the excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that
the additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from
the excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in
the MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most
favorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113%
compared to the fossil baseline. These results show that the implementation of
CCS in the HTL process is a promising alternative from technical, economic and

"Deep Switching Auto-Regressive Factorization:Application to Time Series
  Forecasting",2020-09-10T20:15:59Z,"Amirreza Farnoosh, Bahar Azari, Sarah Ostadabbas","We introduce deep switching auto-regressive factorization (DSARF), a deep
generative model for spatio-temporal data with the capability to unravel
recurring patterns in the data and perform robust short- and long-term
predictions. Similar to other factor analysis methods, DSARF approximates high
dimensional data by a product between time dependent weights and spatially
dependent factors. These weights and factors are in turn represented in terms
of lower dimensional latent variables that are inferred using stochastic
variational inference. DSARF is different from the state-of-the-art techniques
in that it parameterizes the weights in terms of a deep switching vector
auto-regressive likelihood governed with a Markovian prior, which is able to
capture the non-linear inter-dependencies among weights to characterize
multimodal temporal dynamics. This results in a flexible hierarchical deep
generative factor analysis model that can be extended to (i) provide a
collection of potentially interpretable states abstracted from the process
dynamics, and (ii) perform short- and long-term vector time series prediction
in a complex multi-relational setting. Our extensive experiments, which include
simulated data and real data from a wide range of applications such as climate
change, weather forecasting, traffic, infectious disease spread and nonlinear
physical systems attest the superior performance of DSARF in terms of long- and

with time-periodic coefficients in finite dimension, and the response of
time-asymptotic probability measures induced by such SDE's to sufficiently
regular, small perturbations of the underlying dynamics. Understanding such a
response provides a systematic way to study changes of statistical observables
in response to perturbations, and it is often very useful for sensitivity
analysis, uncertainty quantification, and for improving probabilistic
predictions of nonlinear dynamical systems, especially in high dimensions.
Here, we are concerned with the linear response to small perturbations in the
case when the time-asymptotic probability measures are time-periodic. First, we
establish sufficient conditions for the existence of stable random
time-periodic orbits generated by the underlying SDE. Ergodicity of
time-periodic probability measures supported on these random periodic orbits is
subsequently discussed. Then, we derive the so-called fluctuation-dissipation
relations which allow to describe the linear response of statistical
observables to small perturbations away from the time-periodic ergodic regime
in a manner which only exploits the unperturbed dynamics. The results are
formulated in an abstract setting but they apply to problems ranging from

are taking steps to make their power generation sustainable, there is a marked
increase in the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) for electricity

popular sources of energy connected to LV distribution networks. With the
greater integration of solar PV into LV distribution networks, utility
providers impose caps to solar penetration in order to operate their network
safely and within acceptable norms. One parameter that restricts solar PV
penetration is unbalances created by loads and single-phase rooftop schemes
connected to LV distribution grids. In this paper, a novel method is proposed
to mitigate voltage unbalance in LV distribution grids by optimally re-phasing
grid-connected rooftop PV systems. A modified version of the discrete bacterial
foraging optimization algorithm (DBFOA) is introduced as the optimization
technique to minimize the overall voltage unbalance of the network as the
objective function, subjected to various network and operating parameters. The
impact of utilizing the proposed PV re-phasing technique as opposed to a fixed

A social license for nuclear technologies,2020-09-16T19:50:27Z,Seth A. Hoedl,"Nuclear energy technologies have the potential to help mitigate climate
change. However, these technologies face many challenges, including high costs,
societal concern and opposition, and health, safety, environmental and
proliferation risks. Many companies and academic research groups are pursuing
advanced designs, both fission and fusion-based, to address both costs and
these risks. This Chapter complements these efforts by analyzing how nuclear
technologies can address societal concerns through the acquisition of a social
license, a nebulous concept that represents ""society's consent"" and that has
been used to facilitate and improve a wide range of publicly and privately
funded projects and activities subject to a range of regulatory oversight,
including large industrial facilities, controversial genetic engineering

consent-based siting, two aspects of a social license, have been made before.
This chapter modernizes these suggestions by briefly reviewing the social
license and engagement literature. The Chapter discusses, in the context of how
to acquire a social license, the role of government regulation, the role of
project proponents and government actors, and the role of four key principles,
including engendering trust, transparency, meaningful public engagement, and
protection of health, safety and the environment. Further, the Chapter uses the
social license concept to explain why some nuclear waste repositories have

implemented in response. Using big data about shipping, ecoregions, and
environmental conditions, we leverage network analysis and data mining
techniques to assess, visualize, and project ballast water-mediated species
introductions into the Arctic and dispersal of non-native species within the

cumulative risk of non-native species introduction is increasing. We then
consider how environmental conditions can constrain this Arctic introduction
network for species with different physiological limits, thus providing a
species-level tool for decision-makers. Next, we focus on within-Arctic

curves for coastal flooding and demonstrate which insights can be gained from
the functions only. Therefore, we include protection cost curves -- relating
the typical investment costs necessary to protect a city against a natural
hazard of certain magnitude -- which are analogous to and consistent with the
above mentioned damage cost curves. Specifically, we motivate log-logistic
functions, which exhibit a power-law increase at the lower end, and fit them to
the cost curves. As expected, cities with large maximum potential loss
(typically large cities) are also more costly to protect. Moreover, we study
the idealized case of continuous adaptation, i.e.\ increasing protection levels
in the same pace as sea-level rise, and compare the associated costs with
residual damage from extreme events exceeding the protection. Based on the

  status-quo analysis of the public procurement sector",2020-06-09T16:04:36Z,"Tobias Welz, Matthias Stuermer","Sustainable procurement requires organizations to align their purchasing
behavior with regard to broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate
change, social responsibility and other sustainability criteria. The level of
sustainability in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) hardware
procurement is analyzed for two reasons: First, ICT hardware belongs to the six
key product groups in sustainable procurement. Second, ICT in general is
expected to be an important enabler for low-carbon economies, providing
solutions to reduce Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. While the advantages of
sustainable procurement are obvious, certain barriers hinder the adoption in
day-to-day procurement. This case study on ICT hardware discusses the three
important barriers ""lack of clear definitions per product group"", ""missing
market intelligence about sustainable products"" and ""inflexible procedures and
attitudes as barriers for innovative approaches"" based on an in-depth analysis
of sustainable procurement of ICT hardware by the public sector in Switzerland.
To this end, tender data published on the national procurement platform
simap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement
Vocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects. The results
reveal to which extent such criteria as well as their determinants are
currently included in public tenders. Using two different approaches, only a
small number of tenders were found containing sustainability criteria of a wide
range from basic to comprehensive. The overall performance of Swiss public
procurement is benchmarked by comparing the identified sustainability criteria
with available criteria from international key actors in sustainable
procurement. Thus, this analysis provides novel insights on how public agencies
today take sustainability into account when procuring ICT hardware.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05372v1

unprecedented perturbation of stratospheric composition, dynamical circulation
and radiative balance. Here we show from satellite observations that the
resulting planetary-scale blocking of solar radiation by the smoke is larger
than any previously documented wildfires and of the same order as the radiative
forcing produced by moderate volcanic eruptions. A striking effect of the solar
heating of an intense smoke patch was the generation of a self-maintained
anticyclonic vortex measuring 1000 km in diameter and featuring its own ozone
hole. The highly stable vortex persisted in the stratosphere for over 13 weeks,
travelled 66,000 km and lifted a confined bubble of smoke and moisture to 35 km
altitude. Its evolution was tracked by several satellite-based sensors and was
successfully resolved by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
operational system, primarily based on satellite data. Because wildfires are
expected to increase in frequency and strength in a changing climate, we
suggest that extraordinary events of this type may contribute significantly to
the global stratospheric composition in the coming decades.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07284v2
"Investigating the biological potential of galactic cosmic ray-induced
  radiation-driven chemical disequilibrium in the Martian subsurface
  environment",2020-06-15T15:38:41Z,Dimitra Atri,"There is growing evidence suggesting the presence of aqueous environment on
ancient Mars, raising the question of the possibility of life in such an
environment. Subsequently, with the erosion of the Martian atmosphere resulting
in drastic changes in its climate, surface water disappeared, shrinking
habitable spaces on the planet, with only a limited amount of water remaining
near the surface in form of brines and water-ice deposits. Life, if it ever
existed, would have had to adapt to harsh modern conditions, which includes low
temperatures and surface pressure, and high radiation dose. Presently, there is
no evidence of any biological activity on the planet's surface, however, the
subsurface environment, which is yet to be explored, is less harsh, has traces
of water in form of water-ice and brines, and undergoes radiation-driven redox
chemistry. I hypothesize that Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR)-induced
radiation-driven chemical disequilibrium can be used for metabolic energy by
extant life, and host organisms using mechanisms seen in similar chemical and
radiation environments on Earth. I propose a GCR-induced radiolytic zone, and
discuss the prospects of finding such life with Rosalind Franklin rover of the

Graph Learning for Inverse Landscape Genetics,2020-06-22T15:26:30Z,"Prathamesh Dharangutte, Christopher Musco","The problem of inferring unknown graph edges from numerical data at a graph's
nodes appears in many forms across machine learning. We study a version of this
problem that arises in the field of \emph{landscape genetics}, where genetic
similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained
by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape.
Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for \emph{inverse landscape
genetics}, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of
genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape
genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that
threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is
widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development.
Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph
\emph{effective resistances} (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape
genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of
these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building
on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. 2018 on learning edges in social
networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving
this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real
genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence,
significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field. By providing
researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work
will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12334v3
Impact of Tides on the Potential for Exoplanets to Host Exomoons,2020-07-03T04:04:11Z,"Armen Tokadjian, Anthony L. Piro","Exomoons may play an important role in determining the habitability of worlds
outside of our solar system. They can stabilize conditions, alter the climate
by breaking tidal locking with the parent star, drive tidal heating, and
perhaps even host life themselves. However, the ability of an exoplanet to
sustain an exomoon depends on complex tidal interactions. Motivated by this, we
make use of simplified tidal lag models to follow the evolution of the
separations and orbital and rotational periods in planet, star, and moon
systems. We apply these models to known exoplanet systems to assess the
potential for these exoplanets to host exomoons. We find that there are at
least 36 systems in which an exoplanet in the habitable zone may host an
exomoon for longer than one gigayear. This includes Kepler-1625b, an exoplanet
with an exomoon candidate, which we determine would be able to retain a
Neptune-sized moon for longer than a Hubble time. These results may help
provide potential targets for future observation. In many cases, there remains
considerable uncertainty in the composition of specific exoplanets. We show the
detection (or not) of an exomoon would provide an important constraint on the
planet structure due to differences in their tidal response.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01487v2
"Degrees of individual and groupwise backward and forward responsibility

  choice problems",2020-07-09T13:19:13Z,"Jobst Heitzig, Sarah Hiller","Many real-world situations of ethical relevance, in particular those of
large-scale social choice such as mitigating climate change, involve not only
many agents whose decisions interact in complicated ways, but also various

In such problems, an assessment of individual and groupwise moral
responsibility for ethically undesired outcomes or their responsibility to
avoid such is challenging and prone to the risk of under- or overdetermination
of responsibility. In contrast to existing approaches based on strict causation
or certain deontic logics that focus on a binary classification of
`responsible' vs `not responsible', we here present several different
quantitative responsibility metrics that assess responsibility degrees in units
of probability. For this, we use a framework based on an adapted version of
extensive-form game trees and an axiomatic approach that specifies a number of
potentially desirable properties of such metrics, and then test the developed
candidate metrics by their application to a number of paradigmatic social
choice situations. We find that while most properties one might desire of such
responsibility metrics can be fulfilled by some variant, an optimal metric that
clearly outperforms others has yet to be found.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07352v1

How the growth of ice depends on the fluid dynamics underneath,2020-07-28T14:16:08Z,"Ziqi Wang, Enrico Calzavarini, Chao Sun, Federico Toschi","Convective flows coupled with solidification or melting in water bodies play
a major role in shaping geophysical landscapes. Particularly in relation to the
global climate warming scenario, it is essential to be able to accurately
quantify how water-body environments dynamically interplay with ice formation
or melting process. Previous studies have revealed the complex nature of the
icing process, but have often ignored one of the most remarkable particularity
of water, its density anomaly, and the induced stratification layers
interacting and coupling in a complex way in presence of turbulence and phase
change. By combining experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical
modeling, we investigate solidification of freshwater, properly considering
phase transition, water density anomaly, and real physical properties of ice
and water phases, which we show to be essential for correctly predicting the
different qualitative and quantitative behaviors. We identify, with increasing
thermal driving, four distinct flow-dynamics regimes, where different levels of
coupling among ice front, stably and unstably stratified water layers occur.
Despite the complex interaction between the ice front and fluid motions,
remarkably, the average ice thickness and growth rate can be well captured with
the theoretical model. It is revealed that the thermal driving has major
effects on the temporal evolution of the global icing process, which can vary
from a few days to a few hours in the current parameter regime. Our model can
be applied to general situations where the icing dynamics occurs under
different thermal and geometrical conditions (e.g. cooling conditions or water
layer depth).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14252v2

  Evolution of Venus?",2020-08-11T18:00:21Z,"Stephen R. Kane, Pam Vervoort, Jonathan Horner, Francisco J. Pozuelos","In the study of planetary habitability and terrestrial atmospheric evolution,
the divergence of surface conditions for Venus and Earth remains an area of
active research. Among the intrinsic and external influences on the Venusian
climate history are orbital changes due to giant planet migration that have
both variable incident flux and tidal heating consequences. Here, we present
the results of a study that explores the effect of Jupiter's location on the
orbital parameters of Venus and subsequent potential water loss scenarios. Our
dynamical simulations show that various scenarios of Jovian migration could
have resulted in orbital eccentricities for Venus as high as 0.31. We quantify
the implications of the increased eccentricity, including tidal energy, surface
energy flux, and the variable insolation flux expected from the faint young
Sun. The tidal circularization timescale calculations demonstrate that a
relatively high tidal dissipation factor is required to reduce the eccentricity
of Venus to the present value, which implies a high initial water inventory. We
further estimate the consequences of high orbital eccentricity on water loss,
and estimate that the water loss rate may have increased by at least $\sim$5\%
compared with the circular orbit case as a result of orbital forcing. We argue
that these eccentricity variations for the young Venus may have accelerated the
atmospheric evolution of Venus towards the inevitable collapse of the
atmosphere into a runaway greenhouse state. The presence of giant planets in
exoplanetary systems may likewise increase the expected rate of Venus analogs
in those systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04927v2

proposed estimating the carbon financial risk of equities by their carbon beta.
To achieve this, the primary task is to develop a brown-minus-green (or BMG)
risk factor, similar to Fama and French (1992). Secondly, we must estimate the
carbon beta using a multi-factor model. While G\""orgen \textsl{et al.} (2019)

"LSTM-based Space Occupancy Prediction towards Efficient Building Energy

energy usage. A large amount of building energy is used for heating, cooling,
ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). However, compared to its importance,
building energy management systems nowadays are limited in controlling HVAC
based on simple rule-based control (RBC) technologies. The ability to design
systems that can efficiently manage HVAC can reduce energy usage and greenhouse
gas emissions, and, all in all, it can help us to mitigate climate change. This
paper proposes predictive time-series models of occupancy patterns using LSTM.
Prediction signal for future room occupancy status on the next time span (e.g.,
next 30 minutes) can be directly used to operate HVAC. For example, based on
the prediction and considering the time for cooling or heating, HVAC can be
turned on before the room is being used (e.g., turn on 10 minutes earlier).
Also, based on the next room empty prediction timing, HVAC can be turned off
earlier, and it can help us increase the efficiency of HVAC while not
decreasing comfort. We demonstrate our approach's capabilities using real-world
energy data collected from multiple rooms of a university building. We show
that LSTM's room occupancy prediction based HVAC control could save energy
usage by 50% compared to conventional RBC based control.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08114v2

in higher commodity prices, lower consumer demand and lower inventory levels.
Using Bayesian estimation, we apply the dynamic food systems model to infer the

Quantifying atmospheric dynamics of hot planets is critical to a complete

rotation, with a best-fit velocity of $10.0^{+2.4}_{-2.0}$ km s$^{-1}$,

and could provide the world with much-needed leadership on how to limit warming
to +1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. But the
pathways that would achieve net zero by 2060 are still unclear, including the
role of negative emissions technologies. We use the Global Change Analysis
Model to simulate how negative emissions technologies, in general, and direct
air capture (DAC) in particular, could contribute to China's meeting this
target. Our results show that negative emissions could play a large role,
offsetting on the order of 3 GtCO2 per year from difficult-to-mitigate sectors
such as freight transportation and heavy industry. This includes up to a 1.6
GtCO2 per year contribution from DAC, constituting up to 60% of total projected
negative emissions in China. But DAC, like bioenergy with carbon capture and
storage and afforestation, has not yet been demonstrated at anywhere
approaching the scales required to meaningfully contribute to climate
mitigation. Deploying NETs at these scales will have widespread impacts on
financial systems and natural resources such as water, land, and energy in

"A global method to identify trees outside of closed-canopy forests with
  medium-resolution satellite imagery",2020-05-13T15:58:01Z,"John Brandt, Fred Stolle","Scattered trees outside of dense, closed-canopy forests are very important
for carbon sequestration, supporting livelihoods, maintaining ecosystem
integrity, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. In contrast to trees
inside of closed-canopy forests, not much is known about the spatial extent and
distribution of scattered trees at a global scale. Due to the cost of
high-resolution satellite imagery, global monitoring systems rely on
medium-resolution satellites to monitor land use. Here we present a globally
consistent method to identify trees with canopy diameters greater than three
meters with medium-resolution optical and radar imagery. Biweekly cloud-free,
pan-sharpened 10 meter Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 radar imagery
are used to train a fully convolutional network, consisting of a convolutional
gated recurrent unit layer and a feature pyramid attention layer. Tested across
more than 215,000 Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pixels distributed from -60 to +60
latitude, the proposed model exceeds 75% user's and producer's accuracy
identifying trees in hectares with a low to medium density (less than 40%) of
tree cover, and 95% user's and producer's accuracy in hectares with dense
(greater than 40%) tree cover. The proposed method increases the accuracy of
monitoring tree presence in areas with sparse and scattered tree cover (less
than 40%) by as much as 20%, and reduces commission and omission error in
mountainous and very cloudy regions by nearly half. When applied across large,
heterogeneous landscapes, the results demonstrate potential to map trees in
high detail and accuracy over diverse landscapes across the globe. This
information is important for understanding current land cover and can be used
to detect changes in land cover such as agroforestry, buffer zones around
biological hotspots, and expansion or encroachment of forests.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08702v2
"Re-examining rates of lithium-ion battery technology improvement and
  cost decline",2020-07-28T00:15:47Z,"Micah S. Ziegler, Jessika E. Trancik","Lithium-ion technologies are increasingly employed to electrify
transportation and provide stationary energy storage for electrical grids, and
as such their development has garnered much attention. However, their
deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend
on their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement.
Understanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation
strategies, including public policies and technology development efforts.
However, many existing models of past cost decline, which often serve as
starting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and
measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize,
and combine various data series of price, market size, research and
development, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop
representative series for these measures and employ performance curve models to
estimate improvement rates. We also develop a method to incorporate additional
performance characteristics into these models, including energy density and
specific energy performance metrics. When energy density is incorporated into
the definition of service provided by a lithium-ion cell, estimated
technological improvement rates increase considerably, suggesting that
previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of
lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our estimates suggest the degree to
which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by
performance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also
suggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where
restrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost
declines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to
further characterize this potential.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13920v2
"The impact of analytical outage modeling on expansion planning problems
  in the area of power systems",2020-01-23T21:25:43Z,"S. Tsianikas, N. Yousefi, J. Zhou, D. W. Coit","Expansion planning problems refer to the monetary and unit investment needed
for energy production or storage. An inherent element in these problems is the
element of stochasticity in various aspects, such as the generation output of
the units, climate change or frequency and duration of grid outages. Especially
for the latter one, outage modeling is crucial to be carefully considered when
designing systems with distributed generation at their core, such as
microgrids. In most studies so far, a single statistical distribution is used,
such as a Poisson Process. However, by taking a closer look at the real outage
data provided by the state of NY, it is observed that the outages do not seem
to come from the same distribution. In some years, there is a huge spike in the
average duration per outage and this is because of catastrophic events.
Therefore, in this study we propose and test an alternative modeling for outage
events. This alternative scheme will be based on the premise that outages can
be broadly classified into two categories: regular and severe. Under this
taxonomy, it can still be assumed that each type of events follows a Poisson
Process but outages, in general, follow a Poisson Process which is truly a
superposition of these two types. A reinforcement learning approach is used to
solve the expansion planning problem and real location-specific data are used.
The results verify our initial hypothesis and show that the optimization
results are significantly affected by the outage modeling. To sum up, modeling
accurately the grid outage events and measuring directly the reliability
performance of an energy system during catastrophic failures could provide
invaluable tools and insights that could therefore be used for the best
possible preparation for this type of outages.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08815v1

or massive floods in different parts of the world. Knowing variation in
precipitation can effectively help the water resources decision-makers in water
resources management. Large-scale circulation drivers have a considerable
impact on precipitation in different parts of the world. In this research, the
impact of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on seasonal precipitation over Iran
was investigated. For this purpose, 103 synoptic stations with at least 30
years of data were utilized. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the
indices in the previous 12 months with seasonal precipitation was calculated,
and the meaningful correlations were extracted. Then the month in which each of
these indices has the highest correlation with seasonal precipitation was
determined. Finally, the overall amount of increase or decrease in seasonal
precipitation due to each of these indices was calculated. Results indicate the
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NAO, and PDO have the most impact on seasonal
precipitation, respectively. Also, these indices have the highest impact on the
precipitation in winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively. SOI has a
diverse impact on winter precipitation compared to the PDO and NAO, while in
the other seasons, each index has its special impact on seasonal precipitation.
Generally, all indices in different phases may decrease the seasonal
precipitation up to 100%. However, the seasonal precipitation may increase more
than 100% in different seasons due to the impact of these indices. The results
of this study can be used effectively in water resources management and
especially in dam operation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09757v1

present a scoping review of ML in wildfire science and management. Our
objective is to improve awareness of ML among wildfire scientists and managers,
as well as illustrate the challenging range of problems in wildfire science
available to data scientists. We first present an overview of popular ML
approaches used in wildfire science to date, and then review their use in
wildfire science within six problem domains: 1) fuels characterization, fire
detection, and mapping; 2) fire weather and climate change; 3) fire occurrence,
susceptibility, and risk; 4) fire behavior prediction; 5) fire effects; and 6)
fire management. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML
approaches and identify opportunities for future advances in wildfire science
and management within a data science context. We identified 298 relevant
publications, where the most frequently used ML methods included random
forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector
machines, and genetic algorithms. There exists opportunities to apply more
current ML methods (e.g., deep learning and agent based learning) in wildfire
science. However, despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own,
expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of
fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods

"Assessing the Significance of Directed and Multivariate Measures of
  Linear Dependence Between Time Series",2020-03-09T02:06:01Z,"Oliver M. Cliff, Leonardo Novelli, Ben D. Fulcher, James M. Shine, Joseph T. Lizier","Inferring linear dependence between time series is central to our
understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis
tests that are used to determine statistically significant directed or
multivariate relationships from time-series data often yield spurious
associations (Type I errors) or omit causal relationships (Type II errors).
This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or
prewhitening approaches), and instead that the degrees of freedom in
statistical tests should be altered to account for the effective sample size
induced by cross-correlations in the observations. This insight enabled us to
derive modified hypothesis tests for any multivariate correlation-based
measures of linear dependence between covariance-stationary time series,
including Granger causality and mutual information with Gaussian marginals. We
use both numerical simulations (generated by autoregressive models and digital
filtering) as well as recorded fMRI-neuroimaging data to show that our tests
are unbiased for a variety of stationary time series. Our experiments
demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and
without prewhitening of the signals. These findings suggest that many
dependencies reported in the scientific literature may have been, and may
continue to be, spuriously reported or missed if modified hypothesis tests are
not used when analysing time series.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887v3

percolation theory. Also, we employ a spin $S$ = 1/2 Ising-like model and a
(logistic) Fermi-Dirac-like function to describe the spread of Covid-19. Our
analysis reinforces well-established literature results, namely: \emph{i}) that
the epidemic curves can be described by a Gaussian-type function; \emph{ii})
that the temporal evolution of the accumulative number of infections and
fatalities follow a logistic function, which has some resemblance with a
distorted Fermi-Dirac-like function; \emph{iii}) the key role played by the
quarantine to block the spread of Covid-19 in terms of an \emph{interacting}
parameter, which emulates the contact between infected and non-infected people.
Furthermore, in the frame of elementary percolation theory, we show that:
\emph{i}) the percolation probability can be associated with the probability of
a person being infected with Covid-19; \emph{ii}) the concepts of blocked and
non-blocked connections can be associated, respectively, with a person
respecting or not the social distancing, impacting thus in the probability of
an infected person to infect other people. Increasing the number of infected
people leads to an increase in the number of net connections, giving rise thus
to a higher probability of new infections (percolation). We demonstrate the
importance of social distancing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 in a
pedagogical way. Given the impossibility of making a precise forecast of the
disease spread, we highlight the importance of taking into account additional
factors, such as climate changes and urbanization, in the mathematical
description of epidemics. Yet, we make a connection between the standard

than 90 percent of this energy has been stored in the ocean as heat since 1970,
with about 64 percent of that in the upper 700 m. Differences in upper ocean
heat content anomaly (OHCA) estimates, however, exist. Here, we evaluate spread
in upper OHCA estimates arising from choices in instrumental bias corrections
and mapping methods, in addition to the effect of using a common ocean mask.
The same dataset was mapped by six research groups for 1970 to 2008, with six
instrumental bias corrections applied to expendable bathythermograph (XBT)
data. We find that use of a common ocean mask may impact estimation of global
OHCA by +- 13 percent. Uncertainty due to mapping method dominates over XBT
bias correction at a global scale and is largest in the Indian Ocean and in the
eddy-rich and frontal regions of all basins. Uncertainty due to XBT bias
correction is largest in the Pacific Ocean within 30N to 30S. In both mapping
and XBT cases, spread is higher since the 1990s. Important differences in
spatial trends among mapping methods are found in the well-observed Northwest
Atlantic and the poorly-observed Southern Ocean. Although our results cannot

status and thereby restoration progress to be evaluated. Here we present a new
pipeline, SLIC-UAV, for processing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery to map
early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline is novel because
it comprises: (a) a time-efficient approach for labelling crowns from UAV
imagery; (b) machine learning of species based on spectral and textural
features within individual tree crowns, and (c) automatic segmentation of
orthomosaiced UAV imagery into 'superpixels', using Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC). Creating superpixels reduces the dataset's dimensionality
and focuses prediction onto clusters of pixels, greatly improving accuracy. To
demonstrate SLIC-UAV, support vector machines and random forests were used to
predict the species of hand-labelled crowns in a restoration concession in
Indonesia. Random forests were most accurate at discriminating species for
whole crowns, with accuracy ranging from 79.3% when mapping five common
species, to 90.5% when mapping the three most visually-distinctive species. In
contrast, support vector machines proved better for labelling automatically
segmented superpixels, with accuracy ranging from 74.3% to 91.7% for the same

scientific milestones have been achieved thanks to the development of
high-performance computing, the resultant environmental impact has been
underappreciated. In this paper, we present a methodological framework to
estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a standardised and
reliable way, based on the processing time, type of computing cores, memory
available and the efficiency and location of the computing facility. Metrics to
interpret and contextualise greenhouse gas emissions are defined, including the
equivalent distance travelled by car or plane as well as the number of

Algorithms tool easily integrates with computational processes as it requires
minimal information and does not interfere with existing code, while also
accounting for a broad range of CPUs, GPUs, cloud computing, local servers and

Wygant","One of the discoveries made by Parker Solar Probe during first encounters
with the Sun is the ubiquitous presence of relatively small-scale structures
standing out as sudden deflections of the magnetic field. They were called
switchbacks as some of them show up the full reversal of the radial component
of the magnetic field and then return to regular conditions. Analyzing the
magnetic field and plasma perturbations associated with switchbacks we identify
three types of structures with slightly different characteristics: 1. Alfvenic
structures, where the variations of the magnetic field components take place
while the magnitude of the field remains constant; 2. Compressional, the field
magnitude varies together with changes of the components; 3. Structures
manifesting full reversal of the magnetic field (extremal class of Alfvenic
structures). Processing of structures boundaries and plasma bulk velocity
perturbations lead to the conclusion that they represent localized magnetic
field tubes with enhanced parallel plasma velocity and ion beta moving together
with respect to surrounding plasma. The magnetic field deflections before and
after the switchbacks reveal the existence of total axial current. The electric
currents are concentrated on the relatively narrow boundary layers on the
surface of the tubes and determine the magnetic field perturbations inside the
tube. These currents are closed on the structure surface, and typically have
comparable azimuthal and the axial components. The surface of the structure may
also accommodate an electromagnetic wave, that assists to particles in carrying
currents. We suggest that the two types of structures we analyzed here may
represent the local manifestations of the tube deformations corresponding to a
saturated stage of the Firehose instability development.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05409v1

Detecting Hierarchical Changes in Latent Variable Models,2020-11-18T18:46:10Z,"Shintaro Fukushima, Kenji Yamanishi","This paper addresses the issue of detecting hierarchical changes in latent
variable models (HCDL) from data streams. There are three different levels of
changes for latent variable models: 1) the first level is the change in data
distribution for fixed latent variables, 2) the second one is that in the
distribution over latent variables, and 3) the third one is that in the number
of latent variables. It is important to detect these changes because we can
analyze the causes of changes by identifying which level a change comes from
(change interpretability). This paper proposes an information-theoretic
framework for detecting changes of the three levels in a hierarchical way. The
key idea to realize it is to employ the MDL (minimum description length) change
statistics for measuring the degree of change, in combination with DNML
(decomposed normalized maximum likelihood) code-length calculation. We give a
theoretical basis for making reliable alarms for changes. Focusing on
stochastic block models, we employ synthetic and benchmark datasets to
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of change
interpretability as well as change detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09465v3
Change Point Detection in Software Performance Testing,2020-03-01T21:01:25Z,"David Daly, William Brown, Henrik Ingo, Jim O'Leary, David Bradford","We describe our process for automatic detection of performance changes for a
software product in the presence of noise. A large collection of tests run
periodically as changes to our software product are committed to our source
repository, and we would like to identify the commits responsible for
performance regressions. Previously, we relied on manual inspection of time
series graphs to identify significant changes. That was later replaced with a
threshold-based detection system, but neither system was sufficient for finding
changes in performance in a timely manner. This work describes our recent
implementation of a change point detection system built upon the E-Divisive
means algorithm. The algorithm produces a list of change points representing
significant changes from a given history of performance results. A human
reviews the list of change points for actionable changes, which are then
triaged for further inspection. Using change point detection has had a dramatic
impact on our ability to detect performance changes. Quantitatively, it has
dramatically dropped our false positive rate for performance changes, while
qualitatively it has made the entire performance evaluation process easier,
more productive (ex. catching smaller regressions), and more timely.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00584v1
Semantic Change Pattern Analysis,2020-03-07T02:22:19Z,"Wensheng Cheng, Yan Zhang, Xu Lei, Wen Yang, Guisong Xia","Change detection is an important problem in vision field, especially for
aerial images. However, most works focus on traditional change detection, i.e.,
where changes happen, without considering the change type information, i.e.,
what changes happen. Although a few works have tried to apply semantic
information to traditional change detection, they either only give the label of
emerging objects without taking the change type into consideration, or set some
kinds of change subjectively without specifying semantic information. To make
use of semantic information and analyze change types comprehensively, we
propose a new task called semantic change pattern analysis for aerial images.

including both where and what changes happen. We then describe the metric
adopted for the task, which is clean and interpretable. We further provide the

  Detection",2020-01-17T11:51:35Z,"Xinzheng Zhang, Guo Liu, Ce Zhang, Peter M Atkinson, Xiaoheng Tan, Xin Jian, Xichuan Zhou, Yongming Li","Change detection is one of the fundamental applications of synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) images. However, speckle noise presented in SAR images has a much
negative effect on change detection. In this research, a novel two-phase
object-based deep learning approach is proposed for multi-temporal SAR image
change detection. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach
brings two main innovations. One is to classify all pixels into three
categories rather than two categories: unchanged pixels, changed pixels caused
by strong speckle (false changes), and changed pixels formed by real terrain
variation (real changes). The other is to group neighboring pixels into
segmented into superpixel objects (from pixels) such as to exploit local
spatial context. Two phases are designed in the methodology: 1) Generate
objects based on the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, and
discriminate these objects into changed and unchanged classes using fuzzy
c-means (FCM) clustering and a deep PCANet. The prediction of this Phase is the
set of changed and unchanged superpixels. 2) Deep learning on the pixel sets
over the changed superpixels only, obtained in the first phase, to discriminate
real changes from false changes. SLIC is employed again to achieve new
superpixels in the second phase. Low rank and sparse decomposition are applied
to these new superpixels to suppress speckle noise significantly. A further
clustering step is applied to these new superpixels via FCM. A new PCANet is
then trained to classify two kinds of changed superpixels to achieve the final
change maps. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with benchmark
methods, the proposed approach can distinguish real changes from false changes
effectively with significantly reduced false alarm rates, and achieve up to
99.71% change detection accuracy using multi-temporal SAR imagery.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06252v1
"A Weakly Supervised Convolutional Network for Change Segmentation and
  Classification",2020-11-06T20:20:45Z,"Philipp Andermatt, Radu Timofte","Fully supervised change detection methods require difficult to procure
pixel-level labels, while weakly supervised approaches can be trained with
image-level labels. However, most of these approaches require a combination of
changed and unchanged image pairs for training. Thus, these methods can not
directly be used for datasets where only changed image pairs are available. We
present W-CDNet, a novel weakly supervised change detection network that can be
trained with image-level semantic labels. Additionally, W-CDNet can be trained
with two different types of datasets, either containing changed image pairs
only or a mixture of changed and unchanged image pairs. Since we use
image-level semantic labels for training, we simultaneously create a change
mask and label the changed object for single-label images. W-CDNet employs a
W-shaped siamese U-net to extract feature maps from an image pair which then
get compared in order to create a raw change mask. The core part of our model,
the Change Segmentation and Classification (CSC) module, learns an accurate
change mask at a hidden layer by using a custom Remapping Block and then
segmenting the current input image with the change mask. The segmented image is
used to predict the image-level semantic label. The correct label can only be
predicted if the change mask actually marks relevant change. This forces the
model to learn an accurate change mask. We demonstrate the segmentation and
classification performance of our approach and achieve top results on AICD and
HRSCD, two public aerial imaging change detection datasets as well as on a Food
Waste change detection dataset. Our code is available at

The generalized Price equation: forces that change population statistics,2020-03-19T18:43:59Z,"Steven A. Frank, William Godsoe","The Price equation partitions the change in the expected value of a
population measure. The first component describes the partial change caused by
altered frequencies. The second component describes the partial change caused
by altered measurements. In biology, frequency changes often associate with the
direct effect of natural selection. Measure changes reflect processes during
transmission that alter trait values. More broadly, the two components describe
the direct forces that change population composition and the altered frame of
reference that changes measured values. The classic Price equation is limited
to population statistics that can expressed as the expected value of a measure.
Many statistics cannot be expressed as expected values, such as the harmonic
mean and the family of rescaled diversity measures. We generalize the Price
equation to any population statistic that can be expressed as a function of
frequencies and measurements. We obtain the generalized partition between the

these new changes. And by comparing the executions of the generated test case

However, the requirements and oracles on the new changes with existing program

they are not sufficiently examined with other unchanged code, which finally

the notion of evolutionary conflict checking to validate new changes. By
extracting developers' intention reflected by new changes and transforming the

models for complex systems require accurate identification of dynamically
changing process characteristics. Existing data driven change point methods
(DD-CPD) assume changes are extraneous to the system, thus cannot utilize
available process knowledge. This work proposes a unified framework for
process-driven multi-variate change point detection (PD-CPD) by combining
change point detection models with machine learning and process-driven
simulation modeling. The PD-CPD, after initializing with DD-CPD's change
point(s), uses simulation models to generate system level outputs as
time-series data streams which are then used to train neural network models to
predict system characteristics and change points. The accuracy of the
predictive models measures the likelihood that the actual process data conforms
to the simulated change points in system characteristics. PD-CPD iteratively
optimizes change points by repeating simulation and predictive model building
steps until the set of change point(s) with the maximum likelihood is
identified. Using an emergency department case study, we show that PD-CPD

Contact network changes in ordered and disordered disk packings,2020-08-05T01:15:05Z,"P. J. Tuckman, K. VanderWerf, Y. Yuan, S. Zhang, J. Zhang, M. D. Shattuck, C. S. O'Hern","We investigate the mechanical response of packings of purely repulsive,
frictionless disks to quasistatic deformations. The deformations include simple
shear strain at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure,
""polydispersity"" strain (in which we change the particle size distribution) at
constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, and isotropic compression.
For each deformation, we show that there are two classes of changes in the
interparticle contact networks: jump changes and point changes. Jump changes
occur when a contact network becomes mechanically unstable, particles
""rearrange"", and the potential energy (when the strain is applied at constant
packing fraction) or enthalpy (when the strain is applied at constant pressure)
and all derivatives are discontinuous. During point changes, a single contact
is either added to or removed from the contact network. For repulsive linear
spring interactions, second- and higher-order derivatives of the potential
energy/enthalpy are discontinuous at a point change, while for Hertzian
interactions, third- and higher-order derivatives of the potential
energy/enthalpy are discontinuous. We illustrate the importance of point
changes by studying the transition from a hexagonal crystal to a disordered
crystal induced by applying polydispersity strain. During this transition, the

be divergent at certain rate as the sample size goes to infinity. We define a

MOSUM-based methods, the novel objective function exhibits an useful ``PULSE""
pattern near change points in the sense: at the population level, the value at
any change point plus 2 times of the segment length of the moving average
attains a local minimum tending to zero following by a local maximum going to
infinity. This feature provides an efficient way to simultaneously identify all
change points at the sample level. In theory, the number of change points can
be consistently estimated and the locations can also be consistently estimated
in a certain sense. Further, because of its visualization nature, in practice,
the locations can be relatively more easily identified by plots than existing
methods in the literature. The method can also handle the case in which the
signals of some change points are very weak in the sense that those changes go

Limits on Testing Structural Changes in Ising Models,2020-11-07T03:33:56Z,"Aditya Gangrade, Bobak Nazer, Venkatesh Saligrama","We present novel information-theoretic limits on detecting sparse changes in
Ising models, a problem that arises in many applications where network changes
can occur due to some external stimuli. We show that the sample complexity for
detecting sparse changes, in a minimax sense, is no better than learning the
entire model even in settings with local sparsity. This is a surprising fact in
light of prior work rooted in sparse recovery methods, which suggest that
sample complexity in this context scales only with the number of network
changes. To shed light on when change detection is easier than structured
learning, we consider testing of edge deletion in forest-structured graphs, and
high-temperature ferromagnets as case studies. We show for these that testing
of small changes is similarly hard, but testing of \emph{large} changes is
well-separated from structure learning. These results imply that testing of
graphical models may not be amenable to concepts such as restricted strong
convexity leveraged for sparsity pattern recovery, and algorithm development
instead should be directed towards detection of large changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03678v1

algorithm uses methods similar to that of wild-binary segmentation. The second
algorithm estimates change-points by maximizing a penalized version of the
classical Kruskal Wallis ANOVA test statistic. We show that this objective
function can be maximized via the well-known PELT algorithm. Under mild,
nonparametric assumptions both of these algorithms are shown to be consistent
for the correct number of change-points and the correct location(s) of the
change-point(s). We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods with a simulation

Optimal Change-Point Detection and Localization,2020-10-22T06:26:01Z,"Nicolas Verzelen, Magalie Fromont, Matthieu Lerasle, Patricia Reynaud-Bouret","Given a times series ${\bf Y}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a piece-wise contant
mean and independent components, the twin problems of change-point detection
and change-point localization respectively amount to detecting the existence of
times where the mean varies and estimating the positions of those
change-points. In this work, we tightly characterize optimal rates for both
problems and uncover the phase transition phenomenon from a global testing
problem to a local estimation problem. Introducing a suitable definition of the
energy of a change-point, we first establish in the single change-point setting
that the optimal detection threshold is $\sqrt{2\log\log(n)}$. When the energy
is just above the detection threshold, then the problem of localizing the
change-point becomes purely parametric: it only depends on the difference in
means and not on the position of the change-point anymore. Interestingly, for
most change-point positions, it is possible to detect and localize them at a
much smaller energy level. In the multiple change-point setting, we establish
the energy detection threshold and show similarly that the optimal localization
error of a specific change-point becomes purely parametric. Along the way,
tight optimal rates for Hausdorff and $l_1$ estimation losses of the vector of
all change-points positions are also established. Two procedures achieving
these optimal rates are introduced. The first one is a least-squares estimator
with a new multiscale penalty that favours well spread change-points. The
second one is a two-step multiscale post-processing procedure whose
computational complexity can be as low as $O(n\log(n))$. Notably, these two
procedures accommodate with the presence of possibly many low-energy and
therefore undetectable change-points and are still able to detect and localize
high-energy change-points even with the presence of those nuisance parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11470v2

consider the sequential monitoring of test items, in particular, the detection
of abrupt changes to their psychometric properties, where a change can be
caused by, for example, leakage of the item or change of the corresponding
curriculum. We propose a statistical framework for the detection of abrupt
changes in individual items. This framework consists of (1) a multi-stream
Bayesian change point model describing sequential changes in items, (2) a
compound risk function quantifying the risk in sequential decisions, and (3)
sequential decision rules that control the compound risk. Throughout the
sequential decision process, the proposed decision rule balances the trade-off
between two sources of errors, the false detection of pre-change items and the
non-detection of post-change items. An item-specific monitoring statistic is
proposed based on an item response theory model that eliminates the confounding
from the examinee population which changes over time. Sequential decision rules

difference information between multitemporal remote sensing images and lack
robustness to pseudo-change information. To overcome the lack of resistance of
current methods to pseudo-changes, in this paper, we propose a new method,
namely, dual attentive fully convolutional Siamese networks (DASNet) for change

long-range dependencies are captured to obtain more discriminant feature
representations to enhance the recognition performance of the model. Moreover,
the imbalanced sample is a serious problem in change detection, i.e. unchanged

matchings between two sets of observations, a query set and a reference set,
despite severe appearance changes. Recently, image comparison using CNN-based
descriptors showed very promising results. However, existing experiments from
the literature typically assume a single distinctive condition within each set
(e.g., reference: day, query: night). We demonstrate that as soon as the
conditions change within one set (e.g., reference: day, query: traversal
daytime-dusk-night-dawn), different places under the same condition can
suddenly look more similar than same places under different conditions and
state-of-the-art approaches like CNN-based descriptors fail. This paper
discusses this practically very important problem of in-sequence condition
changes and defines a hierarchy of problem setups from (1) no in-sequence
changes, (2) discrete in-sequence changes, to (3) continuous in-sequence
changes. We will experimentally evaluate the effect of these changes on two
state-of-the-art CNN-descriptors. Our experiments emphasize the importance of
statistical standardization of descriptors and shows its limitations in case of

  Analysis",2020-03-26T17:18:41Z,"Sotiris Skaperas, Lefteris Mamatas, Arsenia Chorti","Video content is responsible for more than 70% of the global IP traffic.
Consequently, it is important for content delivery infrastructures to rapidly
detect and respond to changes in content popularity dynamics. In this paper, we
propose the employment of on-line change point (CP) analysis to implement
real-time, autonomous and low-complexity video content popularity detection.
Our proposal, denoted as real-time change point detector (RCPD), estimates the
existence, the number and the direction of changes on the average number of
video visits by combining: (i) off-line and on-line CP detection algorithms;
(ii) an improved time-series segmentation heuristic for the reliable detection
of multiple CPs; and (iii) two algorithms for the identification of the
direction of changes. The proposed detector is validated against synthetic
data, as well as a large database of real YouTube video visits. It is
demonstrated that the RCPD can accurately identify changes in the average
content popularity and the direction of change. In particular, the success rate
of the RCPD over synthetic data is shown to exceed 94% for medium and large
changes in content popularity. Additionally,the dynamic time warping distance,
between the actual and the estimated changes, has been found to range
between20sampleson average, over synthetic data, to52samples, in real data.The
rapid responsiveness of the RCPD is instrumental in the deployment of

multiple change-point models. This algorithm can be used to pinpoint the
precise locations of abrupt changes in large data sequences. There are many
application domains for such models, such as medicine, neuroscience or
genomics. Often, practitioners have prior knowledge about the changes they are
looking for. For example in genomic data, biologists sometimes expect peaks: up
changes followed by down changes. Taking advantage of such prior information

about the types of change that are possible and implements several loss

improve the detectability of traveltime changes: a wave that propagates several
times down and up through a reservoir layer will undergo a larger time shift
due to reservoir changes than a primary reflection. Since we are interested in
monitoring very local changes (usually in a thin reservoir layer), it would be
advantageous if we could identify the reservoir-related internal multiples in

Detection of and upper limits on changes in impact parameter yield valuable
constraints on a planetary system's three dimensional architecture. Constraints
for warm Jupiters are particularly interesting because they allow us to test
origins theories that invoke a mutually inclined perturber. Because of warm
Jupiters' high signal-to-noise transits, changes in impact parameter are
feasible to detect. However, here we show that allowing the impact parameter to
vary uniformly and independently from transit to transit leads to incorrect
inferences about the change, propagating to incorrect inferences about the
perturber. We demonstrate that an appropriate prior on the change in impact
parameter mitigates this problem. We apply our approach to eight systems from

handled when also majority quantifiers may be used.
  In this paper we extend these results by showing that, for changes of
polylogarithmic size, first-order update formulas suffice for maintaining (1)
undirected reachability, and (2) directed reachability under insertions. For
classes of directed graphs for which efficient parallel algorithms can compute
non-zero circulation weights, reachability can be maintained with update
formulas that may use ""modulo 2"" quantifiers under changes of polylogarithmic

two set of pseudo labels are used to jointly train a student network with the
same structure as the teacher. The final change detection result can be
obtained by the trained student network. Besides, we design an image filter to

insignificantly with rising temperature if temperature is the only changing
parameter. In the experiments evaluated, temperature was changed simultaneously
with optical dipole trap depth. Thus, simulations included the Stark shift
based on the known polarizability of the free atoms and assuming their
polarizability remains the same in the bound state. Somewhat surprisingly, we
found that, while including the Stark shift does lead to minor statistical
changes, it does not change the resonance statistics and, therefore, is not
responsible for the experimentally observed statistic transformation. This

minimising a penalised cost based on this model. We develop a novel and

Epidemic changepoint detection in the presence of nuisance changes,2020-08-19T03:32:51Z,"Julius Juodakis, Stephen Marsland","Many time series problems feature epidemic changes - segments where a

ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the
comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing

than in the traditional image domain, which greatly alleviates loss of useful
information for determining the changes. Furthermore, by reformulating change
detection as an image translation problem, we apply the recently popular
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in which our W-Net serves as the
Generator, leading to a new GAN architecture for change detection which we call
CDGAN. To train our networks and also facilitate future research, we construct
a large scale dataset by collecting images from Google Earth and provide
carefully manually annotated ground truths. Experiments show that our proposed
methods can provide fine-grained change detection results superior to the
existing state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06583v1
"A Cooperative Control Framework for CAV Lane Change in a Mixed Traffic
  Environment",2020-10-12T03:57:21Z,"Runjia Du, Sikai Chen, Yujie Li, Jiqian Dong, Paul Young Joun Ha, Samuel Labi","In preparing for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a worrisome aspect
is the transition era which will be characterized by mixed traffic (where CAVs
and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) share the roadway). Consistent with
expectations that CAVs will improve road safety, on-road CAVs may adopt rather
conservative control policies, and this will likely cause HDVs to unduly
exploit CAV conservativeness by driving in ways that imperil safety. A context
of this situation is lane-changing by the CAV. Without cooperation from other
vehicles in the traffic stream, it can be extremely unsafe for the CAV to
change lanes under dense, high-speed traffic conditions. The cooperation of
neighboring vehicles is indispensable. To address this issue, this paper
develops a control framework where connected HDVs and CAV can cooperate to
facilitate safe and efficient lane changing by the CAV. Throughout the
lane-change process, the safety of not only the CAV but also of all neighboring
vehicles, is ensured through a collision avoidance mechanism in the control
framework. The overall traffic flow efficiency is analyzed in terms of the
ambient level of CHDV-CAV cooperation. The analysis outcomes are including the
CAVs lane-change feasibility, the overall duration of the lane change. Lane
change is a major source of traffic disturbance at multi-lane highways that
impair their traffic flow efficiency. In providing a control framework for lane
change in mixed traffic, this study shows how CHDV-CAV cooperation could help
enhancing system efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05439v1
"A Probabilistic Approach in Historical Linguistics Word Order Change in
  Infinitival Clauses: from Latin to Old French",2020-11-16T20:30:31Z,Olga Scrivner,"This research offers a new interdisciplinary approach to the field of
Linguistics by using Computational Linguistics, NLP, Bayesian Statistics and
Sociolinguistics methods. This thesis investigates word order change in
infinitival clauses from Object-Verb (OV) to Verb-Object (VO) in the history of
Latin and Old French. By applying a variationist approach, I examine a
synchronic word order variation in each stage of language change, from which I
infer the character, periodization and constraints of diachronic variation. I
also show that in discourse-configurational languages, such as Latin and Early
Old French, it is possible to identify pragmatically neutral contexts by using
information structure annotation. I further argue that by mapping pragmatic
categories into a syntactic structure, we can detect how word order change
unfolds. For this investigation, the data are extracted from annotated corpora
spanning several centuries of Latin and Old French and from additional
resources created by using computational linguistic methods. The data are then
further codified for various pragmatic, semantic, syntactic and sociolinguistic
factors. This study also evaluates previous factors proposed to account for
word order alternation and change. I show how information structure and
syntactic constraints change over time and propose a method that allows
researchers to differentiate a stable word order alternation from alternation
indicating a change. Finally, I present a three-stage probabilistic model of
word order change, which also conforms to traditional language change patterns.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08262v1
Berry Flux Diagonalization: Application to Electric Polarization,2020-02-07T19:51:58Z,"John Bonini, David Vanderbilt, Karin M. Rabe","The switching polarization of a ferroelectric is a characterization of the
current that flows due to changes in polarization when the system is switched
between two states. Computation of this change in polarization in crystal
systems has been enabled by the modern theory of polarization, where it is
expressed in terms of a change in Berry phase as the material switches. It is
straightforward to compute this change of phase, but only modulo $2\pi$,
requiring a branch choice from among a lattice of values separated by $2\pi$.
The measured switching polarization depends on the actual path along which the
material switches, which in general involves nucleation and growth of domains
and is therefore quite complex. In this work, we present a physically motivated
approach for predicting the experimentally measured switching polarization that
involves separating the change in phase between two states into as many
gauge-invariant smaller phase changes as possible. As long as the magnitudes of
these smaller phase changes remain smaller than $\pi$, their sum forms a phase
change which corresponds to the change one would find along any path involving
minimal evolution of the atomic and electronic structure. We show that for
typical ferroelectrics, including those that would have otherwise required a
densely sampled path, this technique allows the switching polarization to be
computed without any need for intermediate sampling between oppositely
polarized states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02995v2
"Detection of data drift and outliers affecting machine learning model
  performance over time",2020-12-16T20:50:12Z,"Samuel Ackerman, Eitan Farchi, Orna Raz, Marcel Zalmanovici, Parijat Dube","A trained ML model is deployed on another `test' dataset where target feature
values (labels) are unknown. Drift is distribution change between the training
and deployment data, which is concerning if model performance changes. For a
cat/dog image classifier, for instance, drift during deployment could be rabbit
images (new class) or cat/dog images with changed characteristics (change in
distribution). We wish to detect these changes but can't measure accuracy
without deployment data labels. We instead detect drift indirectly by
nonparametrically testing the distribution of model prediction confidence for
changes. This generalizes our method and sidesteps domain-specific feature
representation.
  We address important statistical issues, particularly Type-1 error control in
sequential testing, using Change Point Models (CPMs; see Adams and Ross 2012).
We also use nonparametric outlier methods to show the user suspicious
observations for model diagnosis, since the before/after change confidence
distributions overlap significantly. In experiments to demonstrate robustness,
we train on a subset of MNIST digit classes, then insert drift (e.g., unseen
digit class) in deployment data in various settings (gradual/sudden changes in
the drift proportion). A novel loss function is introduced to compare the
performance (detection delay, Type-1 and 2 errors) of a drift detector under
different levels of drift class contamination.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09258v3
Data segmentation algorithms: Univariate mean change and beyond,2020-12-23T17:21:33Z,"Haeran Cho, Claudia Kirch","Data segmentation a.k.a. multiple change point analysis has received
considerable attention due to its importance in time series analysis and signal
processing, with applications in a variety of fields including natural and
social sciences, medicine, engineering and finance.
  In the first part of this survey, we review the existing literature on the
canonical data segmentation problem which aims at detecting and localising
multiple change points in the mean of univariate time series. We provide an
overview of popular methodologies on their computational complexity and
theoretical properties. In particular, our theoretical discussion focuses on
the separation rate relating to which change points are detectable by a given
procedure, and the localisation rate quantifying the precision of corresponding
change point estimators, and we distinguish between whether a homogeneous or
multiscale viewpoint has been adopted in their derivation. We further highlight
that the latter viewpoint provides the most general setting for investigating
the optimality of data segmentation algorithms.
  Arguably, the canonical segmentation problem has been the most popular
framework to propose new data segmentation algorithms and study their
efficiency in the last decades. In the second part of this survey, we motivate
the importance of attaining an in-depth understanding of strengths and
weaknesses of methodologies for the change point problem in a simpler,
univariate setting, as a stepping stone for the development of methodologies
for more complex problems. We illustrate this with a range of examples

Fletcher, Abhishek Basak, Alaa Alameldeen","Recent security vulnerabilities that target speculative execution (e.g.,
Spectre) present a significant challenge for processor design. The highly
publicized vulnerability uses speculative execution to learn victim secrets by
changing cache state. As a result, recent computer architecture research has
focused on invisible speculation mechanisms that attempt to block changes in
cache state due to speculative execution. Prior work has shown significant
success in preventing Spectre and other vulnerabilities at modest performance
costs. In this paper, we introduce speculative interference attacks, which show
that prior invisible speculation mechanisms do not fully block these
speculation-based attacks. We make two key observations. First, misspeculated
younger instructions can change the timing of older, bound-to-retire
instructions, including memory operations. Second, changing the timing of a
memory operation can change the order of that memory operation relative to
other memory operations, resulting in persistent changes to the cache state.
Using these observations, we demonstrate (among other attack variants) that
secret information accessed by mis-speculated instructions can change the order
of bound-to-retire loads. Load timing changes can therefore leave
secret-dependent changes in the cache, even in the presence of invisible
speculation mechanisms. We show that this problem is not easy to fix:
Speculative interference converts timing changes to persistent cache-state
changes, and timing is typically ignored by many cache-based defenses. We
develop a framework to understand the attack and demonstrate concrete
proof-of-concept attacks against invisible speculation mechanisms. We provide
security definitions sufficient to block speculative interference attacks;
describe a simple defense mechanism with a high performance cost; and discuss
how future research can improve its performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11818v4

the rapid transitions in spectral type that are observed in increasingly more

interpretation of changing-look AGNs by modeling the polarization variations
that can be observed, in particular, polarized-light echoes. Methods: We built
a complex and representative model of an AGN and its host galaxy and ran
radiative transfer simulations to obtain realistic time-dependent polarization

low-luminosity (Seyferts) changing-look AGNs for a representative set of
inclinations. We predict the evolution of the continuum polarization for future
polarimetric campaigns with the goal to better understand the physics at work

"Change Detection in Heterogeneous Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Images
  via Deep Homogeneous Feature Fusion",2020-04-08T06:27:37Z,"Xiao Jiang, Gang Li, Yu Liu, Xiao-Ping Zhang, You He","Change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images is crucial for
disaster damage assessment. Recent methods use homogenous transformation, which
transforms the heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images into the
same feature space, to achieve change detection. Such transformations mainly
operate on the low-level feature space and may corrupt the semantic content,
deteriorating the performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this
paper presents a new homogeneous transformation model termed deep homogeneous
feature fusion (DHFF) based on image style transfer (IST). Unlike the existing
methods, the DHFF method segregates the semantic content and the style features
in the heterogeneous images to perform homogeneous transformation. The
separation of the semantic content and the style in homogeneous transformation
prevents the corruption of image semantic content, especially in the regions of
change. In this way, the detection performance is improved with accurate
homogeneous transformation. Furthermore, we present a new iterative IST (IIST)
strategy, where the cost function in each IST iteration measures and thus
maximizes the feature homogeneity in additional new feature subspaces for
change detection. After that, change detection is accomplished accurately on
the original and the transformed images that are in the same feature space.
Real remote sensing images acquired by SAR and optical satellites are utilized
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate
that the proposed DHFF method achieves significant improvement for change
detection in heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images, in terms of

Rank-based change-point analysis for long-range dependent time series,2020-04-14T15:00:24Z,"Annika Betken, Martin Wendler","We consider change-point tests based on rank statistics to test for
structural changes in long-range dependent observations. Under the hypothesis
of stationary time series and under the assumption of a change with decreasing
change-point height, the asymptotic distributions of corresponding test
statistics are derived. For this, a uniform reduction principle for the
sequential empirical process in a two-parameter Skorohod space equipped with a
weighted supremum norm is proved. Moreover, we compare the efficiency of rank
tests resulting from the consideration of different score functions. Under
Gaussianity, the asymptotic relative efficiency of rank-based tests with
respect to the CuSum test is 1, irrespective of the score function. Regarding
the practical implementation of rank-based change-point tests, we suggest to
combine self-normalized rank statistics with subsampling. The theoretical
results are accompanied by simulation studies that, in particular, allow for a
comparison of rank tests resulting from different score functions. With respect
to the finite sample performance of rank-based change-point tests, the Van der
Waerden rank test proves to be favorable in a broad range of situations.
Finally, we analyze data sets from economy, hydrology, and network traffic

  Adversarial Network",2020-09-08T10:26:04Z,"Caijun Ren, Xiangyu Wang, Jian Gao, Huanhuan Chen","Detecting changed regions in paired satellite images plays a key role in many
remote sensing applications. The evolution of recent techniques could provide
satellite images with very high spatial resolution (VHR) but made it
challenging to apply image coregistration, and many change detection methods
are dependent on its accuracy.Two images of the same scene taken at different
time or from different angle would introduce unregistered objects and the
existence of both unregistered areas and actual changed areas would lower the
performance of many change detection algorithms in unsupervised condition.To

model would produce better coregistered images where changes can be easily
spotted and then the change map can be presented through a comparison strategy
using these generated images explicitly.Compared to other deep learning-based
methods, our method is less sensitive to the problem of unregistered images and
makes most of the deep learning structure.Experimental results on synthetic
images and real data with many different scenes could demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03630v2
"Publication Patterns' Changes due to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A
  longitudinal and short-term scientometric analysis",2020-10-06T10:09:41Z,"Shir Aviv-Reuven, Ariel Rosenfeld","In recent months the COVID-19 (also known as SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus)
pandemic has spread throughout the world. In parallel, extensive scholarly
research regarding various aspects of the pandemic has been published. In this
work, we analyse the changes in biomedical publishing patterns due to the
pandemic. We study the changes in the volume of publications in both peer
reviewed journals and preprint servers, average time to acceptance of papers
submitted to biomedical journals, international (co-)authorship of these papers
(expressed by diversity and volume), and the possible association between
journal metrics and said changes. We study these possible changes using two
approaches: a short-term analysis through which changes during the first six
months of the outbreak are examined for both COVID-19 related papers and
non-COVID-19 related papers; and a longitudinal approach through which changes
are examined in comparison to the previous four years. Our results show that
the pandemic has so far had a tremendous effect on all examined accounts of
scholarly publications: A sharp increase in publication volume has been
witnessed and it can be almost entirely attributed to the pandemic; a
significantly faster mean time to acceptance for COVID-19 papers is apparent,
and it has (partially) come at the expense of non-COVID-19 papers; and a
significant reduction in international collaboration for COVID-19 papers has
also been identified. As the pandemic continues to spread, these changes may
cause a slow down in research in non-COVID-19 biomedical fields and bring about
a lower rate of international collaboration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02594v2

"Hierarchical Paired Channel Fusion Network for Street Scene Change
  Detection",2020-10-19T23:51:28Z,"Yinjie Lei, Duo Peng, Pingping Zhang, Qiuhong Ke, Haifeng Li","Street Scene Change Detection (SSCD) aims to locate the changed regions
between a given street-view image pair captured at different times, which is an
important yet challenging task in the computer vision community. The intuitive
way to solve the SSCD task is to fuse the extracted image feature pairs, and
then directly measure the dissimilarity parts for producing a change map.
Therefore, the key for the SSCD task is to design an effective feature fusion
method that can improve the accuracy of the corresponding change maps. To this
end, we present a novel Hierarchical Paired Channel Fusion Network (HPCFNet),
which utilizes the adaptive fusion of paired feature channels. Specifically,
the features of a given image pair are jointly extracted by a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) and hierarchically combined by exploring
the fusion of channel pairs at multiple feature levels. In addition, based on
the observation that the distribution of scene changes is diverse, we further
propose a Multi-Part Feature Learning (MPFL) strategy to detect diverse
changes. Based on the MPFL strategy, our framework achieves a novel approach to
adapt to the scale and location diversities of the scene change regions.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., PCD, VL-CMU-CD and
CDnet2014) demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior
performance which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with a
considerable margin.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09925v1
"Characterizing Service Provider Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the
  United States",2020-11-01T04:22:23Z,"Shinan Liu, Paul Schmitt, Francesco Bronzino, Nick Feamster","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to the daily habits of
billions of people. Users increasingly have to rely on home broadband Internet
access for work, education, and other activities. These changes have resulted
in corresponding changes to Internet traffic patterns. This paper aims to
characterize the effects of these changes with respect to Internet service
providers in the United States. We study three questions: (1)How did traffic
demands change in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?;
(2)What effects have these changes had on Internet performance?; (3)How did
service providers respond to these changes? We study these questions using data
from a diverse collection of sources. Our analysis of interconnection data for
two large ISPs in the United States shows a 30-60% increase in peak traffic
rates in the first quarter of 2020. In particular, we observe traffic
downstream peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13-20% while upstream peaks
increased by more than 30%. Further, we observe significant variation in
performance across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with
evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a
stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to
changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects,
at more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video
conferencing applications have increased their network footprint, more than
doubling their advertised IP address space.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00419v1

"Seeded Binary Segmentation: A general methodology for fast and optimal
  change point detection",2020-02-16T18:08:10Z,"Solt Kovács, Housen Li, Peter Bühlmann, Axel Munk","In recent years, there has been an increasing demand on efficient algorithms
for large scale change point detection problems. To this end, we propose seeded
binary segmentation, an approach relying on a deterministic construction of
background intervals, called seeded intervals, in which single change points
are searched. The final selection of change points based on the candidates from
seeded intervals can be done in various ways, adapted to the problem at hand.
Thus, seeded binary segmentation is easy to adapt to a wide range of change
point detection problems, let that be univariate, multivariate or even
high-dimensional.
  We consider the univariate Gaussian change in mean setup in detail. For this
specific case we show that seeded binary segmentation leads to a near-linear
time approach (i.e. linear up to a logarithmic factor) independent of the
underlying number of change points. Furthermore, using appropriate selection
methods, the methodology is shown to be asymptotically minimax optimal. While
computationally more efficient, the finite sample estimation performance
remains competitive compared to state of the art procedures. Moreover, we
illustrate the methodology for high-dimensional settings with an inverse
covariance change point detection problem where our proposal leads to massive
computational gains while still exhibiting good statistical performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06633v1

"Changes, States, and Events: The Thread from Staticity to Dynamism in
  the Conceptual Modeling of Systems",2020-08-11T22:08:27Z,Sabah Al-Fedaghi,"This paper examines the concept of change in conceptual modeling. Change is
inherent in the nature of things and has increasingly become a focus of much
interest and investigation. Change can be modeled as a transition between two
states of a finite state machine (FSM). This change represents an exploratory
starting point in this paper. Accordingly, a sample FSM that models a car s
transmission system is re-expressed in terms of a new modeling methodology
called thinging machine (TM) modeling. Recasting the car-transmission model
involves developing (1) an S model that captures the static aspects, (2) a D
model that identifies states, and (3) a B model that specifies the behavior.
The analysis progresses as follows. - S represents an atemporal diagrammatic
description that embeds underlying compositions (static changes) from which the
roots of system behavior can be traced. - S is broken down into multiple
subsystems that correspond to static states (ordered constitutive components).
- Introducing time into static states converts these states into events, and
the behavior (B) model is constructed based on the chronology of these events.
The analysis shows that FSM states are static (atemporal) changes that
introduce temporal events as carriers of behavior. This result enhances the
semantics of the concepts of change, states, and events in modeling and shows
how to specify a system s behavior through its static description.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05017v1
"Change Point Detection in Time Series Data using Autoencoders with a
  Time-Invariant Representation",2020-08-21T15:03:21Z,"Tim De Ryck, Maarten De Vos, Alexander Bertrand","Change point detection (CPD) aims to locate abrupt property changes in time
series data. Recent CPD methods demonstrated the potential of using deep
learning techniques, but often lack the ability to identify more subtle changes
in the autocorrelation statistics of the signal and suffer from a high false
alarm rate. To address these issues, we employ an autoencoder-based methodology
with a novel loss function, through which the used autoencoders learn a
partially time-invariant representation that is tailored for CPD. The result is
a flexible method that allows the user to indicate whether change points should
be sought in the time domain, frequency domain or both. Detectable change
points include abrupt changes in the slope, mean, variance, autocorrelation
function and frequency spectrum. We demonstrate that our proposed method is
consistently highly competitive or superior to baseline methods on diverse
simulated and real-life benchmark data sets. Finally, we mitigate the issue of
false detection alarms through the use of a postprocessing procedure that
combines a matched filter and a newly proposed change point score. We show that
this combination drastically improves the performance of our method as well as
all baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09524v2
"Ensemble Binary Segmentation for irregularly spaced data with
  change-points",2020-03-07T19:56:32Z,Karolos K. Korkas,"We propose a new technique for consistent estimation of the number and
locations of the change-points in the structure of an irregularly spaced time
series. The core of the segmentation procedure is the Ensemble Binary
Segmentation method (EBS), a technique in which a large number of multiple
change-point detection tasks using the Binary Segmentation (BS) method are
applied on sub-samples of the data of differing lengths, and then the results
are combined to create an overall answer. We do not restrict the total number
of change-points a time series can have, therefore, our proposed method works
well when the spacings between change-points are short. Our main change-point
detection statistic is the time-varying Autoregressive Conditional Duration
model on which we apply a transformation process in order to decorrelate it. To
examine the performance of EBS we provide a simulation study for various types
of scenarios. A proof of consistency is also provided. Our methodology is
implemented in the R package eNchange, available to download from CRAN.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03649v3
"Asymptotic delay times of sequential tests based on U-statistics for
  early and late change points",2020-03-19T14:57:14Z,"Claudia Kirch, Christina Stoehr","Sequential change point tests aim at giving an alarm as soon as possible
after a structural break occurs while controlling the asymptotic false alarm
error. For such tests it is of particular importance to understand how quickly
a break is detected. While this is often assessed by simulations only, in this
paper, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the delay time for sequential
change point procedures based on U-statistics. This includes the
difference-of-means (DOM) sequential test, that has been discussed previously,
but also a new robust Wilcoxon sequential change point test. Similar to
asymptotic relative efficiency in an a-posteriori setting, the results allow us
to compare the detection delay of the two procedures. It is shown that the
Wilcoxon sequential procedure has a smaller detection delay for heavier tailed
distributions which is also confirmed by simulations. While the previous
literature only derives results for early change points, we obtain the
asymptotic distribution of the delay time for both early as well as late change
points. Finally, we evaluate how well the asymptotic distribution approximates
the actual stopping times for finite samples via a simulation study.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08847v1
"A novel change point approach for the detection of gas emission sources
  using remotely contained concentration data",2020-04-06T14:17:53Z,"Idris Eckley, Claudia Kirch, Silke Weber","Motivated by an example from remote sensing of gas emission sources, we
derive two novel change point procedures for multivariate time series where, in
contrast to classical change point literature, the changes are not required to
be aligned in the different components of the time series. Instead the change
points are described by a functional relationship where the precise shape
depends on unknown parameters of interest such as the source of the gas
emission in the above example. Two different types of tests and the
corresponding estimators for the unknown parameters describing the change
locations are proposed. We derive the null asymptotics for both tests under
weak assumptions on the error time series and show asymptotic consistency under
alternatives. Furthermore, we prove consistency for the corresponding
estimators of the parameters of interest. The small sample behavior of the
methodology is assessed by means of a simulation study and the above remote
sensing example analyzed in detail.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02692v1
