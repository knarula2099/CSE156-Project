Climate Modeling and Bifurcation,2019-07-15T15:45:48Z,Mayer Humi,"Many papers and monographs were written about the modeling the Earth climate
and its variability. However there is still an obvious need for a module that
presents the fundamentals of climate modeling to students at the undergraduate
level. The present educational paper attempts to fill in this gap. To this end
we collect in this paper the relevant climate data and present a simple zero
and one dimensional models for the mean temperature of the Earth. These models
can exhibit bifurcations from the present Earth climate to an ice age or a
""Venus type of climate"". The models are accompanied by Matlab programs which
enable the user to change the models parameters and explore the impact that
these changes might have on their predictions on Earth climate.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11067v2
The Physics of Climate Variability and Climate Change,2019-10-01T12:43:54Z,"Michael Ghil, Valerio Lucarini","The climate system is a forced, dissipative, nonlinear, complex and
heterogeneous system that is out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The system
exhibits natural variability on many scales of motion, in time as well as
space, and it is subject to various external forcings, natural as well as
anthropogenic. This paper reviews the observational evidence on climate
phenomena and the governing equations of planetary-scale flow, as well as
presenting the key concept of a hierarchy of models as used in the climate
sciences. Recent advances in the application of dynamical systems theory, on
the one hand, and of nonequilibrium statistical physics, on the other, are
brought together for the first time and shown to complement each other in
helping understand and predict the system's behavior. These complementary
points of view permit a self-consistent handling of subgrid-scale phenomena as
stochastic processes, as well as a unified handling of natural climate
variability and forced climate change, along with a treatment of the crucial
issues of climate sensitivity, response, and predictability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00583v2
"Learning Twitter User Sentiments on Climate Change with Limited Labeled
  Data",2019-04-15T21:51:21Z,"Allison Koenecke, Jordi Feliu-Fab√†","While it is well-documented that climate change accepters and deniers have
become increasingly polarized in the United States over time, there has been no
large-scale examination of whether these individuals are prone to changing
their opinions as a result of natural external occurrences. On the
sub-population of Twitter users, we examine whether climate change sentiment
changes in response to five separate natural disasters occurring in the U.S. in
2018. We begin by showing that relevant tweets can be classified with over 75%
accuracy as either accepting or denying climate change when using our
methodology to compensate for limited labeled data; results are robust across
several machine learning models and yield geographic-level results in line with
prior research. We then apply RNNs to conduct a cohort-level analysis showing
that the 2018 hurricanes yielded a statistically significant increase in
average tweet sentiment affirming climate change. However, this effect does not
hold for the 2018 blizzard and wildfires studied, implying that Twitter users'
opinions on climate change are fairly ingrained on this subset of natural
disasters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07342v1
"Weathering Adaptation: Grid Infrastructure Planning in a Changing
  Climate",2019-12-05T23:31:17Z,"Anna M. Brockway, Laurel N. Dunn","Decisions related to electric power systems planning and operations rely on
assumptions and insights informed by historic weather data and records of past
performance. Evolving climate trends are, however, changing the energy use
patterns and operating conditions of grid assets, thus altering the nature and
severity of risks the system faces. Because grid assets remain in operation for
decades, planning for evolving risks will require incorporating climate
projections into grid infrastructure planning processes. The current work
traces a pathway for climate-aware decision-making in the electricity sector.
We evaluate the suitability of using existing climate models and data for
electricity planning and discuss their limitations. We review the interactions
between grid infrastructure and climate by synthesizing what is known about how
changing environmental operating conditions would impact infrastructure
utilization, constraints, and performance. We contextualize our findings by
presenting a case study of California, examining if and where climate data can
be integrated into infrastructure planning processes. The core contribution of
the work is a series of nine recommendations detailing advancements in climate
projections, grid modeling architecture, and disaster preparedness that would
be needed to ensure that infrastructure planning decisions are robust to
uncertainty and risks associated with evolving climate conditions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02920v1
"Beyond Forcing Scenarios: Predicting Climate Change through Response
  Operators in a Coupled General Circulation Model",2019-12-09T12:28:30Z,"Valerio Lembo, Valerio Lucarini, Francesco Ragone","Global Climate Models are key tools for predicting the future response of the
climate system to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here we show
how to use statistical mechanics to construct operators able to flexibly
predict climate change for a variety of climatic variables of interest. We
perform our study on a fully coupled model - MPI-ESM v.1.2 - and for the first
time we prove the effectiveness of response theory in predicting future climate
response to CO$_2$ increase on a vast range of temporal scales, from
inter-annual to centennial, and for very diverse climatic quantities. We
investigate within a unified perspective the transient climate response and the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and assess the role of fast and slow processes.
The prediction of the ocean heat uptake highlights the very slow relaxation to
a newly established steady state. The change in the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC)
is accurately predicted. The AMOC strength is initially reduced and then
undergoes a slow and only partial recovery. The ACC strength initially
increases as a result of changes in the wind stress, then undergoes a slowdown,
followed by a recovery leading to a overshoot with respect to the initial
value. Finally, we are able to predict accurately the temperature change in the
Northern Atlantic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03996v2

locations that have not yet experienced these events. This visual
transformation is paired with climate model predictions to assess likelihood
and type of climate-related events in the long term (50 years) in order to
bring the future closer in the viewers mind. The eventual goal of our project

  Imaging Spectroscopy",2019-06-08T15:39:32Z,"Shubhankar Deshpande, Brian D. Bue, David R. Thompson, Vijay Natraj, Mario Parente","According to a recent investigation, an estimated 33-50% of the world's coral

A strong driver of climate change and the subsequent environmental impact are
greenhouse gases such as methane. However, the exact relation climate change
has to the environmental condition cannot be easily established. Remote sensing
methods are increasingly being used to quantify and draw connections between
rapidly changing climatic conditions and environmental impact. A crucial part
of this analysis is processing spectroscopy data using radiative transfer
models (RTMs) which is a computationally expensive process and limits their use
with high volume imaging spectrometers. This work presents an algorithm that
can efficiently emulate RTMs using neural networks leading to a multifold
speedup in processing time, and yielding multiple downstream benefits.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03479v1

  tipping points",2019-11-12T16:25:23Z,"Marc Wiedermann, Ricarda Winkelmann, Jonathan F. Donges, Christina Eder, Jobst Heitzig, Alexia Katsanidou, E. Keith Smith","Vital parts of the climate system, such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are
at risk even within the aspired aims of the Paris Agreement to limit global
temperature rise to 1.5 -- 2{\deg}C. These so-called natural tipping elements
are characterized by rapid qualitative shifts in their states once a critical
threshold, e.g., of global mean temperature, is transgressed. We argue that the
prevention of such unwanted tipping through effective climate policies may
critically depend on cascading Domino effects from (anticipated) climate
impacts to emission reductions via wanted social tipping in attitudes,
behaviors and policies. Specifically, the latter has recently been noted as a
key aspect in addressing contemporary global challenges, such as climate
change, via self-amplifying positive feedbacks similar to the processes
observable in climate tipping elements. Our discussion is supported with data
on commonly observed linkages between (subjective) climate change knowledge,

such interrelations serves as a necessary condition for the possibility of
rapid climate action.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10063v2
"The maximum likelihood climate change for global warming under the
  influence of greenhouse effect and L√©vy noise",2019-09-06T15:44:40Z,"Yayun Zheng, Fang Yang, Jinqiao Duan, Xu Sun, Ling Fu, J√ºrgen Kurths","An abrupt climatic transition could be triggered by a single extreme event,

generate such extreme events. In contrast with the classic Gaussian noise, a
comprehensive approach of the most probable transition path for systems under
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise is still lacking. We develop here a probabilistic
framework, based on the nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation, to investigate the
maximum likelihood climate change for an energy balance system under the
influence of greenhouse effect and L\'evy fluctuations. We find that a period
of the cold climate state can be interrupted by a sharp shift to the warmer one
due to larger noise jumps, and the climate change for warming $1.5\rm ^oC$
under an enhanced greenhouse effect generates a step-like growth process. These
results provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of abrupt
climate transitions triggered by a L\'evy process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08693v1

inter-species relationships and species response to the environment. The
climates' impact on the tree species is measured through species abundance in

Recovering the parameters underlying the Lorenz-96 chaotic dynamics,2019-06-16T22:20:05Z,"Soukayna Mouatadid, Pierre Gentine, Wei Yu, Steve Easterbrook","Climate projections suffer from uncertain equilibrium climate sensitivity.
The reason behind this uncertainty is the resolution of global climate models,
which is too coarse to resolve key processes such as clouds and convection.
These processes are approximated using heuristics in a process called
parameterization. The selection of these parameters can be subjective, leading
to significant uncertainties in the way clouds are represented in global
climate models. Here, we explore three deep network algorithms to infer these
parameters in an objective and data-driven way. We compare the performance of a
fully-connected network, a one-dimensional and, a two-dimensional convolutional

social sciences in practice. Can we observe the development of a new
epistemology by the emergence of the climate change debate? Are there

"Modelling the climate and weather of a 2D Lagrangian-averaged
  Euler-Boussinesq equation with transport noise",2019-09-01T12:30:52Z,"Diego Alonso-Oran, Aythami Bethencourt de Leon, Darryl Holm, So Takao","The prediction of climate change and its impact on extreme weather events is
one of the great societal and intellectual challenges of our time. The first
part of the problem is to make the distinction between weather and climate. The
second part is to understand the dynamics of the fluctuations of the physical
variables. The third part is to predict how the variances of the fluctuations
are affected by statistical correlations in their fluctuating dynamics. This
paper investigates a framework called LA SALT which can meet all three parts of
the challenge for the problem of climate change. As a tractable example of this
framework, we consider the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations for an
incompressible stratified fluid flowing under gravity in a vertical plane with
no other external forcing. All three parts of the problem are solved for this
case. In fact, for this problem, the framework also delivers global
well-posedness of the dynamics of the physical variables and closed dynamical
equations for the moments of their fluctuations. Thus, in a well-posed
mathematical setting, the framework developed in this paper shows that the mean
field dynamics combines with an intricate array of correlations in the
fluctuation dynamics to drive the evolution of the mean statistics. The results
of the framework for 2D EB model analysis define its climate, as well as
climate change, weather dynamics, and change of weather statistics, all in the

"Stability of a planetary climate system with the biosphere competing for

second wind. The Gaia concept defines that the biosphere of an inhabited planet
regulates a planetary climate through feedback loops such that the planet
remains habitable. Crunching 'Gaia' puzzle has been a focus of intense
empirical research. Much less attention has been paid to the mathematical
realization of this concept. In this paper, we consider the stability of a
planetary climate system with the dynamic biosphere by linking a conceptual
climate model to a generic population dynamics model with random parameters. We
first show that the dynamics of the corresponding coupled system possesses
multiple timescales and hence falls into the class of slow-fast dynamics. We
then investigate the properties of a general dynamical system to which our
model belongs and prove that the feedbacks from the biosphere dynamics cannot
break the system's stability as long as the biodiversity is sufficiently high.
That may explain why the climate is apparently stable over long time intervals.
Interestingly, our coupled climate-biosphere system can lose its stability if
biodiversity decreases; in this case, the evolution of the biosphere under the
effect of random factors can lead to a global climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07936v3

new means of deriving CFRs that optimally fuse climate proxies with climate
model output. Despite the growing application of DA-based CFRs, little is
understood about how much the assimilated proxies change the statistical
properties of the climate model data. To address this question, we propose a
robust and computationally efficient method, based on functional data depth, to
evaluate differences in the distributions of two spatiotemporal processes. We
apply our test to study global and regional proxy influence in DA-based CFRs by
comparing the background and analysis states, which are treated as two samples
of spatiotemporal fields. We find that the analysis states are significantly
altered from the climate-model-based background states due to the assimilation
of proxies. Moreover, the difference between the analysis and background states
increases with the number of proxies, even in regions far beyond proxy

Embedding Climate Change Engagement in Astronomy Education and Research,2019-07-18T13:38:22Z,"Kathryn Williamson, Travis A. Rector, James Lowenthal","This White Paper is a call to action for astronomers to respond to climate
change with a large structural transition within our profession. Many
astronomers are deeply concerned about climate change and act upon it in their
personal and professional lives, and many organizations within astronomy have
incorporated incremental changes. We need a collective impact model to better
network and grow our efforts so that we can achieve results that are on the
scale appropriate to address climate change at the necessary level indicated by
scientific research; e.g., becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We need to
implement strategies within two primary drivers of our field: (1) Education and
Outreach, and (2) Research Practices and Infrastructure. (1) In the classroom
and through public talks, astronomers reach a large audience. Astronomy is
closely connected to the science of climate change, and it is arguably the most
important topic we include in our curriculum. Due to misinformation and
disinformation, climate change communication is different than for other areas
of science. We therefore need to expand our communication and implement
effective strategies, for which there is now a considerable body of research.
(2) On a per-person basis astronomers have an outsized carbon impact. There are
numerous ways we can reduce our footprint; e.g., in the design and operation of
telescope facilities and in the optimization and reduction of travel.
Fortunately, many of these solutions are win-win scenarios, e.g., increasing
the online presence of conferences will reduce the carbon footprint while
increasing participation, especially for astronomers working with fewer
financial resources. Astronomers have an obligation to act on climate change in
every way possible, and we need to do it now. In this White Paper, we outline a
plan for collective impact using a Networked Improvement Community (NIC)
approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08043v1
"Response of Vertical Velocities in Extratropical Precipitation Extremes
  to Climate Change",2019-10-12T21:11:36Z,"Ziwei Li, Paul O'Gorman","Precipitation extremes intensify in most regions in climate-model
projections. Changes in vertical velocities contribute to the changes in
intensity of precipitation extremes but remain poorly understood. Here, we find
that mid-tropospheric vertical velocities in extratropical precipitation
extremes strengthen overall in simulations of 21st-century climate change. For
each extreme event, we solve the quasi-geostrophic omega equation to decompose
this strengthening into different physical contributions. We first consider a
dry decomposition in which latent heating is treated as an external forcing of
upward motion. Much of the positive contribution to upward motion from
increased latent heating is offset by negative contributions from increases in
dry static stability and changes in the horizontal length scale of vertical
velocities. However, taking changes in latent heating as given is a limitation
when the aim is to understand changes in precipitation, since latent heating
and precipitation are closely linked. Therefore, we also perform a moist
decomposition of the changes in vertical velocities in which latent heating is
represented through a moist static stability. In the moist decomposition,
changes in moist static stability play a key role and contributions from other
factors such as changes in the depth of the upward motion increase in
importance. While both dry and moist decompositions are self-consistent, the
moist dynamical perspective has greater potential to give insights into the
causes of the dynamical contributions to changes in precipitation extremes in
different regions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05644v2

neural-network emulators of physical models: Constraining (1) the loss function
or (2) the architecture of the network itself. Applied to the emulation of
explicitly-resolved cloud processes in a prototype multi-scale climate model,

Co-existing climate attractors in a coupled aquaplanet,2019-07-07T08:54:10Z,"Maura Brunetti, J√©r√¥me Kasparian, Christian V√©rard","The first step in exploring the properties of dynamical systems like the

multiple attractors can co-exist under the effect of the same forcing. At the
boundaries of their basins of attraction, small changes produce large effects.
Therefore, they are key regions for understanding the system response to
perturbations. Here we prove the existence of up to five attractors in a
simplified climate system where the planet is entirely covered by the ocean
(aquaplanet). These attractors range from a snowball to a hot state without sea
ice, and their exact number depends on the details of the coupled

learning to address a global challenge for climate change, risk management from

melt and tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics presents modeling
difficulties, due to uncertainties in global temperature increase, changing
precipitation patterns, occlusion from cloud cover, rapid melting and glacier
retreat due to black carbon aerosol deposition, from wildfires or human fossil

Temperature data with high spatial resolution from nine climate models
implementing three Representative Concentration Pathways from IPCC are used to
estimate climate induced changes in the European demand side for heating. The
demand side is modelled by the proxy of heating-degree days. The supply side is
modelled by using a screening curve approach to the economics of heat
generation. We find that space heating demand decreases by about 16%, 24% and
42% in low, intermediate and extreme global warming scenarios. When considering
historic weather data, we find a heterogeneous mix of technologies are
cost-optimal, depending on the heating load factor (number of full-load hours
per year). Increasing ambient temperatures toward the end-century improve the
economic performance of heat pumps in all concentration pathways. Cost optimal
technologies broadly correspond to heat markets and policies in Europe, with

  Bayesian approach",2019-12-31T20:50:31Z,"Huang Huang, Dorit Hammerling, Bo Li, Richard Smith","Projections of future climate change rely heavily on climate models, and
combining climate models through a multi-model ensemble is both more accurate
than a single climate model and valuable for uncertainty quantification.
However, Bayesian approaches to multi-model ensembles have been criticized for
making oversimplified assumptions about bias and variability, as well as
treating different models as statistically independent. This paper extends the
Bayesian hierarchical approach of Sansom et al. (2017) by explicitly accounting
for spatial variability and inter-model dependence. We propose a Bayesian
hierarchical model that accounts for bias between climate models and
observations, spatial and inter-model dependence, the emergent relationship
between historical and future periods, and natural variability. Extensive
simulations show that our model provides better estimates and uncertainty
quantification than the commonly used simple model mean. These results are
illustrated using data from the CMIP5 model archive. As examples, for Central
North America our projected mean temperature for 2070--2100 is about 0.8 K
lower than the simple model mean, while for East Asia it is about 0.5 K higher;
however, in both cases, the widths of the 90% credible intervals are of the

The impact of stochastic physics on climate sensitivity in EC-Earth,2019-05-16T09:26:24Z,"K. Strommen, P. A. G. Watson, T. N. Palmer","Stochastic schemes, designed to represent unresolved sub-grid scale
variability, are frequently used in short and medium-range weather forecasts,
where they are found to improve several aspects of the model. In recent years,
the impact of stochastic physics has also been found to be beneficial for the
model's long term climate. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time
that the inclusion of a stochastic physics scheme can notably affect a model's
projection of global warming, as well as its historical climatological global
temperature. Specifically, we find that when including the 'stochastically
perturbed parametrisation tendencies' scheme (SPPT) in the fully coupled
climate model EC-Earth v3.1, the predicted level of global warming between 1850
and 2100 is reduced by 10% under an RCP8.5 forcing scenario. We link this
reduction in climate sensitivity to a change in the cloud feedbacks with SPPT.
In particular, the scheme appears to reduce the positive low cloud cover
feedback, and increase the negative cloud optical feedback. A key role is
played by a robust, rapid increase in cloud liquid water with SPPT, which we
speculate is due to the scheme's non-linear interaction with condensation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06613v1

demand on temperature. Due to increasing temperature trend on account of global
warming, its impact on peak electricity demand is a proxy for effective
management of electricity infrastructure. Few studies explore the relationship
between electricity demand and temperature changes in industrial areas in India
mainly due to the limitation of data. The precise role of industrial and
residential activities response to the temperature is not explored in
sub-tropical humid climate of India. Here, we show the temperature sensitivity
of industrial and residential areas in the city of Pune, Maharashtra by keeping
other influencing variables on electricity demand as constant. The study seeks
to estimate the behaviour of peak electricity demand with the apparent
temperature (AT) using the Extreme Value Theory. Our analysis shows that
industrial activities are not much influenced by the temperature whereas
residential activities show around 1.5-2% change in average electricity demand
with 1 degree rise in AT. Further, we show that peak electricity demand in
residential areas, performed using stationary and non-stationary GEV models,
are significantly influenced by the rise in temperature. The study shows that
with the improvement in data collection, better planning for the future

data products typically fail to account for the geographic location of the
underlying weather station data. For modern high-resolution models, this is an
oversight since there are likely grid cells where the physical output of a
climate model is compared with a statistically interpolated quantity instead of
actual measurements of the climate system. In this paper, we quantify the
impact of geographic sampling on the relative performance of high resolution
climate models' representation of precipitation extremes in Boreal winter (DJF)
over the contiguous United States (CONUS), comparing model output from five
early submissions to the HighResMIP subproject of the CMIP6 experiment. We find
that properly accounting for the geographic sampling of weather stations can
significantly change the assessment of model performance. Across the models
considered, failing to account for sampling impacts the different metrics
(extreme bias, spatial pattern correlation, and spatial variability) in
different ways (both increasing and decreasing). We argue that the geographic
sampling of weather stations should be accounted for in order to yield a more
straightforward and appropriate comparison between models and observational
data sets, particularly for high resolution models. While we focus on the CONUS
in this paper, our results have important implications for other global land
regions where the sampling problem is more severe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05103v2
Detecting anthropogenic cloud perturbations with deep learning,2019-11-29T11:22:48Z,"Duncan Watson-Parris, Samuel Sutherland, Matthew Christensen, Anthony Caterini, Dino Sejdinovic, Philip Stier","One of the most pressing questions in climate science is that of the effect
of anthropogenic aerosol on the Earth's energy balance. Aerosols provide the
`seeds' on which cloud droplets form, and changes in the amount of aerosol
available to a cloud can change its brightness and other physical properties
such as optical thickness and spatial extent. Clouds play a critical role in
moderating global temperatures and small perturbations can lead to significant
amounts of cooling or warming. Uncertainty in this effect is so large it is not
currently known if it is negligible, or provides a large enough cooling to
largely negate present-day warming by CO2. This work uses deep convolutional

these techniques are unsupervised, the reduced space considered is somewhat
arbitrary. Here, we propose a supervised approach where we predict a given
external forcing, e.g., anthropogenic forcing, directly from the spatial
pattern of climate variables, and use the predicted forcing as a test statistic
for D&A. We want the prediction to work well even under changes in the

resources, reproduction and dispersal. These shape their biodiversity and how
the system responds to change. Current approaches to modelling ecosystems,
especially plants, focus on either describing fine-scale processes for
individual species or broad-scale patterns for limited groups of plant
functional types.
  Digitisation of herbarium and other plant records has unlocked a wealth of
information that can be used to drive models of plant communities and make
predictions for their future under different scenarios of climate change. The
advent of increased computational capacity and fast, high level programming
languages allows for simulation of such landscapes at unprecedented scales.
  Here, we demonstrate a tool for Ecosystem Simulation through Integrated
Species Trait-Environment Modelling (EcoSISTEM), which models plant species
across multiple ecosystem sizes, from patches and small islands to regions and
entire continents. These simulated ecosystems support the ability to generate
many different types of habitat, as well as reproducing different disturbance
scenarios such as climate change, habitat loss and invasion. EcoSISTEM also
reproduces examples of real-world species distributions by integrating plant
occurrence records and global climate reconstructions to simulate plant species
throughout the continent of Africa for the past century.
  EcoSISTEM allows us to flexibly explore the dynamics of tens of thousands of
species interacting across a continent. The code parallelises efficiently

Robustness of Gaian Feedbacks to Climate Perturbations,2019-06-03T22:45:40Z,"Olivia D. N. Alcabes, Stephanie Olson, Dorian S. Abbot","The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life regulates its environment to be
favorable for its own survival. Most planets experience numerous perturbations
throughout their lifetimes such as asteroid impacts, volcanism, and the
evolution of their host star's luminosity. For the Gaia hypothesis to be
viable, life must be able to keep the conditions of its host planet habitable,
even in the face of these challenges. ExoGaia, a model created to investigate
the Gaia hypothesis, has been previously used to demonstrate that a randomly
mutating biosphere is in some cases capable of maintaining planetary
habitability. However, those model scenarios assumed that all non-biological
planetary parameters were static, neglecting the inevitable perturbations that
real planets would experience. To see how life responds to climate
perturbations to its host planet, we created three climate perturbations in
ExoGaia: one rapid cooling of a planet and two heating events, one rapid and
one gradual. The planets on which Gaian feedbacks emerge without climate
perturbations are the same planets on which life is most likely to survive each
of our perturbation scenarios. Biospheres experiencing gradual changes to the
environment are able to survive changes of larger magnitude than those
experiencing rapid perturbations, and the magnitude of change matters more than
the sign. These findings suggest that if the Gaia hypothesis is correct, then
typical perturbations that a planet would experience may be unlikely to disrupt
Gaian systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01112v2

In addition to known challenges, the spatial and dynamical characteristics of
the boundary are not only affected by the spatial gradient in the environmental
factors, but also by local heterogeneities in the regional characteristics.
Here, we capture the effects of quenched heterogeneities on the ecological
boundary with the disordered contact process in one and two dimensions with a
linear spatial trend in the local control parameter. We apply the
strong-disorder renormalization group method to calculate the sites occupied
with an $O(1)$ probability in the stationary state, readily yielding the
population front's position as the outermost site locally as well as globally
for the entire boundary. We show that under a quasistatic change of the global
environment, mimicking climate change, the front advances intermittently: long
quiescent periods are interrupted by rare but long jumps. The characteristics
of this intermittent dynamics are found to obey universal scaling laws in terms
of the gradient, conjectured to be related to the correlation-length exponent

clear and defined boundary. Multiple tools that have been developed, in the
recent years, for assessment of urban climate, building energy demand, the
outdoor thermal comfort and the energy systems. In this review, we, however,
noted that these tools often address only one or two of these urban planning

outdoor comfort assessment has showed that there is a strong link between
biometeorology and architecture and urban climate. Additionally, to address the
challenges of the energy transition, there will be a convergence of the energy
needs in the future with an energy nexus regrouping the energy demand of urban
areas. It is also highlighted that the uncertainty related to future climatic

circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and
M-dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the
planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface
gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general
circulation model (GCM) that includes non-grey radiative transfer and the
effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show
qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary
parameters as idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the
inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective
cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the
climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high
dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with
increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to
eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be
parameterization-dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from
our simulations of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, finding that changing

On Climate Change and Photovoltaic Energy Production,2019-06-20T13:07:43Z,"Ian Marius Peters, Tonio Buonassisi","As the 21st century progresses, photovoltaic technology is becoming a major
provider of the worlds electricity, while effects of global climate change
unfold. This development begs the question: is climate change affecting the
energy production of solar cells? In this article, we attempt to answer this
question looking backward and forward. We start by analyzing recent trends for
global meteorological conditions and solar cell performance parameters,
covering the ten-year period between 20016 and 2015. We leverage a
field-verified performance model for two of the most well-established solar
cell technologies that also feature very different sensitivities to changing
operating conditions: silicon and cadmium telluride. We find that climate
change has already left its mark: ten years ago, silicon solar panels -- on
average -- generated 4 kWh per m2 more power than today. Correlating solar cell
performance ratio changes and changes in operating conditions, we find that
temperature globally is the leading factor for silicon (-0.52 pm 0.03% per K),
accounting for approx. 85% of the observed effect. Water related light
absorption in the atmosphere is most likely responsible for much of the
remaining contribution. To predict how future solar cell performance is
affected, we focus on the implications of raising temperatures. For the end of
the 21st century, we project that silicon PV panels globally will suffer
performance reductions of between 0.7% and 2.5% (8 to 30 kWh per kWp in North
America), depending on the global warming scenario. These reductions will
result in significant socioeconomic penalties, particularly in a world that
produces a significant portion of its electricity from PV panels, and
especially if additional effects of global warming, like accelerated panel
degradation and extreme weather are considered.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00623v2

climate change impacts as they provide simulations with more small-scale
details and expected smaller errors than global climate models. There has been
much effort to increase the spatial resolution and simulation skill of RCMs,
yet the extent to which this improves the projection of hydrological change is
unclear. Here, we evaluate the skill of five reanalysis-driven Euro-CORDEX RCMs
in simulating precipitation and temperature, and as drivers of a hydrological
model to simulate river flow on four UK catchments covering different physical,
climatic and hydrological characteristics. We test whether high-resolution RCMs
provide added value, through analysis of two RCM resolutions, 50 km and 12.5
km, which are also bias-corrected employing the parametric quantile-mapping
(QM) method, using the normal distribution for temperature, and the Gamma (GQM)
and Double Gamma (DGQM) distributions for precipitation. In a small catchment
with complex topography, the 12.5 km RCMs outperform their 50 km version for
precipitation and temperature, but when used in combination with the
hydrological model, fail to capture the observed river flow distribution. In
the other (larger) catchments, only one high-resolution RCM consistently
outperforms its low-resolution version, implying that in general there is no
added value from using the high-resolution RCMs in those catchments. GQM
decreases most of the simulation biases, except for extreme precipitation and
high flows, which are further decreased by DGQM. Bias correction does not
improve the representation of daily temporal variability, but it does for
monthly variability, in particular when applying DGQM. Overall, an increase in
RCM resolution does not imply a better simulation of hydrology and
bias-correction represents an alternative to ease decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09043v1

Dynamic and Isotopic Evolution of Ice Reservoirs on Mars,2019-01-24T13:41:31Z,"Eran Vos, Oded Aharonson, Norbert Schorghofer","The layered polar caps of Mars have long been thought to be related to
variations in orbit and axial tilt. We dynamically link Mars's past climate
variations with the stratigraphy and isotopic composition of its ice by
modeling the exchange of H2O and HDO among three reservoirs. The model shows
that the interplay among equatorial, mid-latitude, and north-polar layered
deposits (NPLD) induces significant isotopic changes in the cap. The diffusive
properties of the sublimation lags and dust content in our model result in a
cap size consistent with current Mars. The layer thicknesses are mostly
controlled by obliquity variations, but the precession period of 50 kyr
dominates the variations in the isotopic composition during epochs of
relatively low and nearly constant obliquity such as at present. Isotopic
sampling of the top 100 meters may reveal climate oscillations unseen in the
layer thicknesses and would thus probe recent precession-driven climate cycles.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08401v1
A free boundary problem for spreading under shifting climate,2019-08-12T08:03:14Z,"Yuanyang Hu, Xinan Hao, Xianfa Song, Yihong Du","In this paper we consider a free boundary problem which models the spreading
of an invasive species whose spreading is enhanced by the changing climate. We
assume that the climate is shifting with speed c and obtain a complete
classification of the long-time dynamical behaviour of the species. The model
is similar to that in [9] with a slight refinement in the free boundary
condition. While [9], like many works in the literature, investigates the case
that unfavourable environment is shifting into the favourable habitat of the
concerned species, here we examine the situation that the unfavourable habitat
of an invasive species is replaced by a favourable environment with a shifting
speed c. We show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy holds, and there exists a
critical speed$c_0$ such that when spreading happens in the case $c < c_0$, the
spreading profile is determined by a semi-wave with forced speed c, but when $c
\geq c_0$, the spreading profile is determined by the usual semi-wave with
speed $c_0$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04041v1
The Arctic surface climate in CMIP6: status and developments since CMIP5,2019-12-25T12:26:13Z,"Richard Davy, Stephen Outten","Here we evaluate the sea ice, surface air temperature, and sea-level-pressure

CMIP5 ensemble and the ERA5 reanalysis for the period 1979 to 2004. The
principal purpose of this assessment is to provide an overview of the ability
of the CMIP6 ensemble to represent the Arctic climate, and to see how this has
changed since the last Phase of CMIP. Overall, we find a distinct improvement
in the representation of the sea ice volume, but also in the sea ice extent,
mostly linked to improvements in the seasonal cycle in the Barents Sea.
However, numerous model biases have persisted into CMIP6 including too-cold
conditions in the winter (4 K cold bias) and a negative trend in the day-to-day
variability over ice in winter. We find that under the low emission scenario,
SSP126, the Arctic climate is projected to stabilize by 2060 with a sea ice

become even more important as cities continue to grow, causing water and
electricity utilities additional stress, especially given the likely impacts of
future global climatic and socioeconomic changes. Here, we propose a modeling
framework based in statistical learning theory for predicting the
climate-sensitive portion of the coupled water-electricity demand nexus. The
predictive models were built and tested on six Midwestern cities. The results
showed that water use was better predicted than electricity use, indicating
that water use is slightly more sensitive to climate than electricity use.
Additionally, the results demonstrated the importance of the variability in the
El Nino/Southern Oscillation index, which explained the majority of the
covariance in the water-electricity nexus. Our modeling results suggest that
stronger El Ninos lead to an overall increase in water and electricity use in
these cities. The integrated modeling framework presented here can be used to
characterize the climate-related sensitivity of the water-electricity demand

Earth system and hold the promise of being able to make robust projections of
future climate change based on physical laws. However, simulations from these

has been applied to solve certain prediction problems with great success, and
recently it's been proposed that this could replace the role of
physically-derived dynamical weather and climate models to give better quality
simulations. Here, instead, a framework using machine learning together with
physically-derived models is tested, in which it is learnt how to correct the
errors of the latter from timestep to timestep. This maintains the physical
understanding built into the models, whilst allowing performance improvements,
and also requires much simpler algorithms and less training data. This is
tested in the context of simulating the chaotic Lorenz '96 system, and it is
shown that the approach yields models that are stable and that give both
improved skill in initialised predictions and better long-term climate
statistics. Improvements in long-term statistics are smaller than for single

procedure employs statistical bias correction and stochastic downscaling in two
steps. In a first step, errors that are related to spatial and temporal
features of the first two moments of the temperature distribution at model

the finer scale is analyzed using a statistical model, from which realizations
are generated and then combined with appropriate climate change signal to form
the downscaled projection fields. Using a high-resolution observational gridded

'before versus after' effect of climate related human driven interventions,
such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and
forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover
change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the
following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep
learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over
time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify
changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a
Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual.
This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the
difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as
compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly
happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze
deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention)

results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change.
As temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits

freshwater ecosystems were observed, in terms of increases in solutes,
decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos

"The Effects of Gravity on the Climate and Circulation of a Terrestrial
  Planet",2019-01-31T15:24:32Z,"Stephen I. Thomson, Geoffrey K. Vallis","The climate and circulation of a terrestrial planet are governed by, among
other things, the distance to its host star, its size, rotation rate,
obliquity, atmospheric composition and gravity. Here we explore the effects of
the last of these, the Newtonian gravitational acceleration, on its atmosphere
and climate. We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic
primitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial
atmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have
no effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to
say, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation
is unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is
radiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will
generally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the
condensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the
greenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease, leading to
changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate, in the equator-to-pole heat
transport, and in the surface energy balance because of changes in the sensible
and latent fluxes. These effects are all demonstrated both by theoretical
arguments and by numerical simulations with moist and dry general circulation
models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11426v1

calculate the extent to which this effect can drive changes in surface
temperature on circumbinary terrestrial planets. We show that the amplitude of
the temperature variation is largely constrained by the effective heat
capacity, which corresponds to the ocean-to-land ratio on the planet. Planets
with large ocean fractions should experience only modest warming and cooling of
only a few degrees, which suggests that habitability cannot be precluded for

Efficient Method for Updating IDF Curves to Future Climate Projections,2019-06-11T20:22:49Z,"Jonathan B. Butcher, Tan Zi","If climate stationarity is dead, how should engineering design standards be
modified to account for potential changes in extreme precipitation? Many
standards rely on precipitation intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves

increases in average temperature throughout the US, but are less clear on
changes in precipitation. In many areas GCMs predict relatively small changes
in total precipitation volume, but also suggest increased magnitude of extreme
events as warmer air can hold more water. Unfortunately, GCMs have limited
skill in predicting individual storm events. This research developed an
efficient approach to solve this problem that replicates Atlas 14 methods,
which fit a generalized extreme value distribution to the annual maximum
series. GCM biases are addressed through equidistant quantile mapping, mapping
from a GCM's historical simulation to future predictions, then applying this

  deficit",2019-10-07T23:24:14Z,"Jennifer Hsiao, Abigail L. S. Swann, Soo-Hyung Kim","Temperatures over the next century are expected to rise to levels detrimental
to crop growth and yield. As the atmosphere warms without additional water
vapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased
temperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative
impacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often
neglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation
between the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)
and soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent
roles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their
interactions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We
found that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD
increases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.
The negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and
influenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield
loss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased
water loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced
photosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing
season length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss
under warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact
level varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier
conditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and
yield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A
mechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other
climate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield

planetary parameters is vital for the study of terrestrial exoplanet
habitability. Using an idealized general circulation model with a seasonal
cycle, we study the seasonal response of the surface temperature and Hadley
circulation to changes in the orbital, rotational and radiative timescales.
Analyzing the climate's seasonal response to variations in these timescales, we
find a regime transition between planets controlled by the annual mean
insolation to planets controlled by the seasonal variability depending on the
relation between the length of the orbital period, obliquity and radiative
timescale. Consequently, planets with obliquity greater than $54^{\circ}$ and
short orbital period will have a minimum surface temperature at the equator. We
also show that in specific configurations, mainly high atmospheric mass and
short orbital periods, high obliquity planets can still have an equable
climate. Based on the model results, we suggest an empirical power law for the
ascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation and its strength.
These power laws show that the Hadley circulation becomes wider and stronger by
increasing the obliquity and orbital period or by decreasing the atmospheric
mass and rotation rate. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the
rotation rate plays an essential role in dictating the width of the Hadley
circulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05748v1

fast diffusion-such as a road or another transport network-on the dynamics of a
population in an ecological niche. This model consists of a system of coupled
reaction-diffusion equations set on domains with different dimensions (line /
plane). We first show that the presence of the line is always deleterious and
can even lead the population to extinction. Next, we consider the case where
the niche is subject to a displacement, representing the effect of a climate
change or of seasonal variation of resources. We find that in such case the
presence of the line with fast diffusion can help the population to persist. We
also study several qualitative properties of this system. The analysis is based
on a notion of generalized principal eigenvalue developed by the authors in

Optimal forest rotation under carbon pricing and forest damage risk,2019-11-30T21:50:14Z,Tommi Ekholm,"Forests will have two notable economic roles in the future: providing
renewable raw material and storing carbon to mitigate climate change. The
pricing of forest carbon leads to longer rotation times and consequently larger
carbon stocks, but also exposes landowners to a greater risk of forest damage.
This paper investigates optimal forest rotation under carbon pricing and forest
damage risk. I provide the optimality conditions for this problem and
illustrate the setting with numerical calculations representing boreal forests
under a range of carbon prices and damage probabilities. The relation between
damage probability and carbon price towards the optimal rotation length is
nearly linear, with carbon pricing having far greater impact. As such,
increasing forest carbon stocks by lengthening rotations is an economically
attractive method for climate change mitigation, despite the forest damage
risk. Carbon pricing also increases land expectation value and reduces the
economic risks of the landowner. The production possibility frontier under
optimal rotation suggests that significantly larger forests carbon stocks are
achievable, but imply lower harvests. However, forests' societally optimal role
between these two activities is not yet clear-cut; but rests on the future
development of relative prices between timber, carbon and other commodities
dependent on land-use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00269v1
Quantifying Urban Canopy Cover with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,2019-12-03T17:14:53Z,"Bill Cai, Xiaojiang Li, Carlo Ratti","Urban canopy cover is important to mitigate the impact of climate change.

challenges are determining when and how to deploy a finite collection of
sensors to produce a useful data set. We decide when to release sensors by
modeling the deviation of a forecast from actual stratospheric conditions as a
Gaussian process. We then implement a novel hardware system that is capable of
optimally releasing sensors from a rising weather balloon. We show that this
data engineering framework is effective through real weather balloon flights,

A Flexible Pipeline for Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Paths,2019-06-20T20:24:03Z,"Niccol√≤ Dalmasso, Robin Dunn, Benjamin LeRoy, Chad Schafer","Hurricanes and, more generally, tropical cyclones (TCs) are rare, complex

"Reconstruction of Past Human land-use from Pollen Data and Anthropogenic
  land-cover Changes Scenarios",2019-10-24T09:32:49Z,"Behnaz Pirzamanbein, Johan Lindstr√∂m","Accurate maps of past land cover and human land-use are necessary when
studying the impact of anthropogenic land-cover changes on climate. Ideally the
maps of past land cover would be separated into naturally occurring vegetation
and human induced changes, allowing us to quantify the effect of human land-use
on past climate. Here we investigate the possibility of combining regional,
fossil pollen based, land-cover reconstructions with, population based,
estimates of past human land-use. By merging these two datasets and
interpolating the pollen based land-cover reconstructions we aim at obtaining
maps that provide both past natural land-cover and the anthropogenic land-cover
changes. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to handle the complex data,
using a latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) for the interpolation.
Estimation of the model is based on a block updated Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm. The sparse precision matrix of the GMRF together with an
adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin step allows for fast inference.
Uncertainties in the land-use predictions are computed from the MCMC posterior
samples. The model uses the pollen based observations to reconstruct three
composition of land cover; Coniferous forest, Broadleaved forest and
Unforested/Open land. The unforested land is then further decomposed into
natural and human induced openness by inclusion of the estimates of past human
land-use. The model is applied to five time periods - centred around 1900 CE,
1725 CE, 1425 CE, 1000 and, 4000 BCE over Europe. The results suggest pollen
based observations can be used to recover past human land-use by adjusting the
population based anthropogenic land-cover changes estimates.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10993v1
"Estimating resilience of annual crop production systems: theory and
  limitations",2019-02-07T15:14:33Z,"Matteo Zampieri, Christof Weissteiner, Bruna Grizzetti, Andrea Toreti, Maurits van den Berg M., Frank Dentener","Agricultural production is affected by climate extremes, which are increasing
because of global warming. This motivates the need of a proper evaluation of
the agricultural production systems resilience to enhance food security, market
stability, and the general ability of society to cope with the effects of

involving a large number of indicators for the environmental, social and
economic factors that influence food availability, access and utilization.
Here, we investigate the problem of measuring resilience in a simplified
framework, focusing on the crop production component of the agricultural
system. For an idealized production system composed of a single crop, using the
original definition of resilience, we identify the best combination of the mean
and the variance of annual crop production data to estimate crop resilience
i.e. the crop resilience indicator. Through numerical experiments conducted
with a conceptual crop model, we show the general properties of this indicator
applied to production systems for different levels of adaptation to climate
variability and in case of increasing frequencies of extreme events. Finally,
we discuss the applicability of the proposed approach to real agricultural

zone (HZ) boundaries for terrestrial planets of masses 0.1 M$_{E}$ and 5
M$_{E}$ around circumbinary stars of various spectral type combinations.
Specifically, we consider binary systems with host spectral types F-F, F-G,
F-K, F-M, G-G, G-K, G-M, K-K, K-M and M-M. Scaling the background N2
atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, we find that the inner edge
of the HZ moves inwards towards the star for 5ME compared to 0.1ME planets for
all spectral types. This is because the water-vapor column depth is smaller for
larger planets and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely
dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. The outer edge of the HZ changes
little due to competing effects of the albedo and greenhouse effect. While
these results are broadly consistent with the trend of single star HZ results
for different mass planets, there are significant differences between single
star and binary star systems for the inner edge of the HZ. Interesting
combinations of stellar pairs from our 1-D model results can be used to explore

"LULC classification methodology based on simple Convolutional Neural
  Network to map complex urban forms at finer scale: Evidence from Mumbai",2019-09-21T05:00:29Z,"Deepank Verma, Arnab Jana","The satellite imagery classification task is fundamental to spatial knowledge
discovery. Several image classification methods are used to create standardized
Land use and Land cover (LULC) maps, which facilitate research on spatial and
ecological processes and human activities. Local Climate Zones (LCZ)
classification maps are an example of standardized maps which have been widely
used to demarcate the homogeneity in built and natural character in the cities.
The LCZ classification scheme is primarily focused on urban climate-related
research, in which 17 climate zones are mapped in a city area with the 100-150m
spatial resolution. Each zone exhibits physical properties related to urban
form and functions essential for thermal behavior studies. Extending this
widely adopted approach to create LULC maps at finer resolution using the LCZ
mapping scheme would benefit the allied domains of urban planning,
transportation, and water resources management. This study proposes a novel
solution to generate classification maps with a 10-band Sentinel-2B dataset and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at the 10m spatial resolution. The
classification benefits from CNNs property to preserve local structures in the
image datasets. The proposed CNN model outperforms traditional machine learning
models such as Artificial Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector
Machines. The overall accuracy and kappa statistic of the CNN model trained on
14 urban and natural classes are 82 percent and 0.81, respectively. The study

"How do Planetary Radius and Gravity Influence the Surface Climate of
  Earth-like Planets?",2019-10-15T01:56:34Z,"Huanzhou Yang, Jun Yang","About 4000 exoplanets have been confirmed since the year of 1992, and for
most of the planets, the main parameters that can be measured are planetary
radius and mass. Based on these two parameters, surface gravity can be
estimated. In this work, we investigate the effects of varying radius and
gravity on the climate of rapidly rotating terrestrial planets with assuming
they have an ocean and Earth-like atmospheres (N$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O).
Using a three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), we
find that varying radius mainly influences the equator-to-pole surface
temperature difference while varying gravity mainly influences the mean surface
temperature. For planets of larger radii, the meridional atmospheric energy
transport is weaker, which warms the tropics but cools high latitudes. For
planets of larger gravities, the surface is globally cooler due to the fact
that saturated vapor pressure depends on air temperature only and column water
vapor mass is approximately equal to saturated vapor pressure over gravity
multiplied by relative humidity. The relative humidity does not change much in
our experiments. Ice albedo and water vapor feedbacks act to further amplify
the effects of varying radius and gravity. These results suggest that radius
and gravity are important factors for planetary climate, although they are not
as critical as stellar flux, atmospheric composition and mass, and rotation
rate. Future simulations are required to know how large the radius and gravity
could influence the width of the habitable zone using 3D GCMs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06479v1
An Estimate of the Surface Pollution of the Arctic Sea Ice,2019-12-04T19:47:22Z,"A. Laubereau, H. Iglev","The Arctic sea ice represents an important energy reservoir for the climate
of the northern hemisphere. The shrinking of the polar ice in the past decades
decreases the stored energy and raises serious concerns about future climate
changes.[1-4] Model calculations of the present authors [5,6] suggest that half
of the global warming during the past fifty years is directly related to the
retreat of the sea ice, while the cause is not well understood, e.g. the role
of surface pollution [7-10]. We have analysed the reported annual melting and
freezing data of the northern sea ice in the years 1979 to 2018 [11] to gain
some insight. Two features can be deduced from our simple model: (i) recent
results [12,13] are confirmed that approximately 60 % of the loss of sea ice
stems from energy transport to the arctic region. (ii) We find evidence that
the remaining part of the ice retreat originates from an increasing surface
absorption of solar radiation, obviously due to the rising surface pollution of
the sea ice. While the phenomenon was previously considered by several authors
in a qualitative way, our analysis contributes semi-quantitative information on
the situation. We estimate that the relevant fall-out of light absorbing
aerosols onto the sea ice increased by 17 +/- 5 % during the past fifty years.
A deposition of additional 3 +/- 1 % of solar radiation in the melting region
results that accounts for the ice retreat. Recalling the important role of the
ice loss for the terrestrial climate,[3,5,9] the precipitation of air pollution
in the Arctic seems to be an important factor for the global warming.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02226v1

the tidal evolution via ocean. Compared with the tidal evolution with constant
$\varepsilon$, that with varying $\varepsilon$ is slowed down; the Earth-Moon

On Changes of Global Wet-bulb Temperature and Snowfall Regimes,2019-05-19T17:09:45Z,"Sagar K. Tamang, Ardeshir M. Ebtehaj, Andreas F. Prein, Andrew J. Heymsfield","To properly interpret the observed shrinkage of the Earth's cryosphere it is
important to understand global changes of snowfall dominant regimes. To
document these changes, three different reanalysis products of wet-bulb

mean wet-bulb temperature has increased at a rate of 0.34$^\circ$C per decade
(pd) over land and 0.35$^\circ$C pd over ocean, resulting in a reduction of the
annual mean potential areas of snowfall dominant regimes by 0.52/0.34 million

"Percolation theory suggests some general features in range margins
  across environmental gradients",2019-09-02T07:52:25Z,"R. Juh√°sz, B. Oborny","The margins within the geographic range of species are often specific in
terms of ecological and evolutionary processes, and can strongly influence the
species' reaction to climate change. One of the frequently observed features at
range margins is fragmentation, caused internally by population dynamics or
externally by the limited availability of suitable habitat sites. We study both
causes, and describe the transition from a connected to a fragmented state
across space by means of a gradient metapopulation model. The main features of
our approach are the following. 1) Inhomogeneities can occur at two spatial
scales: there is a broad-scale gradient, which can be patterned by fine-scale
heterogeneities. The latter is implemented by dispersing a variable number of
small obstacles over the terrain, which can be penetrable or unpenetrable by
the spreading species. 2) We study the occupancy of this terrain in a
steady-state on two temporal scales: in snapshots and by long-term averages.
The simulations reveal some general scaling laws that are applicable in various
environments, independently of the mechanism of fragmentation. The edge of the
connected region (the hull) is a fractal with dimension 7/4. Its width and
length changes with the gradient according to universal scaling laws, that are
characteristic for percolation transitions. The results suggest that
percolation theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of range
margins in a broad variety of real-life scenarios, including those in which the
environmental gradient is combined with fine-scale heterogeneity. This provides
a new method for comparing the range margins of different species in various
geographic regions, and monitoring range shifts under climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00585v2

dB poleward of about $66^\circ$ geomagnetic latitude, and increasing with
decreasing latitude to about 1 dB equatorward of about $66^\circ$ geomagnetic

elements during the pre-Medieval Warm Period (pre-MWP), Medieval Warm Period

the accumulation season when modern summer-style northerly airflow occurred.
During the MWP, dust delivery to CA decreased, though Fe-intensity in the core

availability increased due to regional drying and strengthening winds, and
strong westerlies blocked meridional flow reducing Fe-rich dust input from the
north. CA has experienced recent warming, desiccation, weakening winds, and
glacier loss. Major climate circulation drivers (Westerlies, Icelandic Low,

"Obliquity Evolution of Circumstellar Planets in Sun-like Stellar
  Binaries",2019-11-19T17:56:15Z,"Billy Quarles, Gongjie Li, Jack J. Lissauer","Changes in planetary obliquity, or axial tilt, influence the climates on
Earth-like planets. In the solar system, the Earth's obliquity is stabilized
due to interactions with our moon and the resulting {small amplitude variations
($\sim$2.4\degree)} are beneficial for advanced life. Most Sun-like stars have
at least one stellar companion and the habitability of circumstellar exoplanets
is shaped by their stellar companion. We show that a stellar companion can
dramatically change whether {Earth-like obliquity stability is} possible
through planetary orbital precession relative to the binary orbit or resonant
pumping of the obliquity through spin-orbit interactions. We present a new
formalism for the planetary spin precession that accounts for orbital
misalignments between the planet and binary. Using numerical modeling in
$\alpha$ Centauri AB we show: a stark contrast between the planetary obliquity
variations depending on the host star, planetary neighbors limit the possible
spin states for {Earth-like obliquity stability}, and the presence of a moon
can destabilize the obliquity, defying our Earth-based expectations. An
Earth-like rotator orbiting the primary star would experience {small} obliquity
variations for 87\%, 74\%, or 54\% of Solar type binaries, depending on the
mass of the primary (0.8, 1.0, or 1.2 M$_\odot$, respectively). Thus,
Earth-like planets likely experience much larger obliquity variations, with
more extreme climates, unless they are in specific states, such as orbiting
nearly planar with the binary and rotating retrograde (backwards) like Venus.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08431v2

expected values, for which a dedicated mathematical development has been done.
The optimized criteria used to evaluate the various scenarii are the Faustmann
value and the Averaged yield value.We illustrate the approach and the software

sequestration optimization of a pine stand.Software interface makes it easy for
users to write their own (growth-tree damage-economic) models without advanced

Coupling Wind Farm with Nuclear Power Plant,2019-09-10T21:10:11Z,Mohamed Kareem Abdel Rahman AlAshery,"Climate change has been identified as one of the greatest challenges facing
nations, governments, businesses and citizens of the globe. The threats of
climate change demand an increase in the share of renewable energy from the
total of energy generation. Meanwhile, there are tremendous efforts to decrease
the reliance on fossil fuel energies which opens the venue for increasing the
usage of alternative resources such as nuclear energy. Many countries (e.g.
Egypt) are planning to meet increasing electricity demands by increasing both
renewable (especially wind energy) and nuclear energies contributions in
electricity generation. In the planning phase of siting both new Wind Farms
(WFs) and Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), many benefits and challenges exist. An
important aspect taken into consideration during the NPP siting is the
existence of ultimate heat sink which is sea water in most cases. That is why
most NPPs are sited on sea coasts. On the other hand, during WF siting, the
main influential aspect is the existence of good wind resources. Many coastal
areas around the world fulfill this requirement for WF siting. Coupling both
NPPs and WFs in one site or nearby has many benefits and obstacles as well. In
this thesis, based on international experience and literature reviews, the
benefits and obstacles of this coupling/adjacency are studied and evaluated.
Various case studies are carried out to verify the coupling/adjacency concept.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08963v1

protecting carbon-rich forests provides co-benefits in terms of biodiversity,
due to the spatial congruence of carbon stocks and biodiversity at
biogeographic scales. However, it remains unclear whether this holds at the
scales relevant for management, with particularly large knowledge gaps for
temperate forests and for taxa other than trees. We built a comprehensive
dataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic
diversity (beetles, birds, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and plants) across 352
plots. We used Boosted Regression Trees to assess the relationship between
above-ground live carbon stocks and (a) taxon-specific richness, (b) a unified
multidiversity index. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to explore

gradually replaced trade-off species with increasing carbon, without clear
thresholds along the above-ground carbon gradient, suggesting that
community-level surrogates (e.g. richness) might fail to detect critical
changes in biodiversity. Collectively, our analyses highlight that leveraging

properties of the empirical distribution of instrumentally measured wave
heights in the southern Caspian Sea and monthly averages of visually observed
wave heights at three locations. A correction for systematic differences leads
to very good correspondence between monthly averaged in situ and satellite data
with a typical root mean square difference of 0.06 m. The average significant
wave height in the Caspian Sea is 0.5-0.7 m in the northern basin of the sea,
around 1.2 m in large parts of the central and southern basins and reaches up
to 1.8 m in the northern segment of the central basin. The basin-wide average
wave intensity varied insignificantly in the range of 1.02-1.14 m in 2002-2013.
These estimates overestimate the wave heights by about 30% because low wave

Eurasian Cooling Patterns in the CMIP5 Climate Models,2019-11-19T09:44:22Z,"Stephen Outten, Richard Davy, Linling Chen","The Arctic has warmed dramatically compared to the global average over the
last few decades. During this same period, there have been strong cooling
trends observed in the wintertime, near-surface air temperature over central
Eurasia, a phenomenon known as Eurasian cooling. Many studies have suggested
that the loss of sea ice, especially in the Barents and Kara Seas, is related
to the cooling over Eurasia, although this connection and its possible
mechanism is still a source of heated debate. Observations and reanalyses show
a clear pattern of co-variability between Arctic sea ice and Eurasian
wintertime temperatures. However, there is an open question regarding how
robustly this teleconnection pattern is reproduced in the current generation of
climate models.
  This study has examined Eurasian cooling in twenty models from the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), both in terms of temperature
trends and by using singular value decomposition to identify patterns of
co-variability between Arctic sea ice concentrations and near-surface
temperatures over Eurasia. These are compared to trends and patterns of
co-variability found in the ERA-Interim reanalysis. While most of the CMIP5
models have a robust pattern of co-variability that is similar to that found in
the reanalysis, many fail to reproduce the wintertime cooling that has been
observed. An examination of Arctic sea ice extent in the models suggests one
possible explanation is the inability of the models to accurately simulate the

between the urban area and the suburban area is greater under low-pressure

importance in regional climate projections. The AMOC has been observed to show
multi-stability across a range of models of different complexity. The simplest
models find a bifurcation associated with the AMOC `on' state losing stability
that is a saddle node. Here we study a physically derived global oceanic model

coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. We find the loss of
stability of the `on' state is due to a subcritical Hopf for parameters from
both pre-industrial and doubled CO${}_2$ atmospheres. This loss of stability
via subcritical Hopf bifurcation has important consequences for the behaviour
of the basin of attraction close to bifurcation. We consider various
time-dependent profiles of freshwater forcing to the system, and find that
rate-induced thresholds for tipping can appear, even for perturbations that do
not cross the bifurcation. Understanding how such state transitions occur is
important in determining allowable safe climate change mitigation pathways to
avoid collapse of the AMOC.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10111v2

points can be modeled as networks of coupled multistable subsystems, e.g.
coupled patches of vegetation, connected lakes, interacting climate tipping
elements or multiscale infrastructure systems. In such networks, tipping events
in one subsystem are able to induce tipping cascades via domino effects. Here,
we investigate the effects of network topology on the occurrence of such

compare the results to those obtained for the model networks. We furthermore
use a directed configuration model and a stochastic block model which preserve
certain topological properties of the Amazon network to understand which of
these properties are responsible for its increased vulnerability. We find that
clustering and spatial organization increase the vulnerability of networks and
can lead to tipping of the whole network. These results could be useful to

power-to-heat converters, storage units, synthetic gas and transmission manage
to deliver an affordable net-zero emissions system. We find that levelised cost
of energy decreases due to heat savings, but not for global temperature
increases. In both cases, heat pumps become less favourable as surplus
electricity is more abundant for heating. Demand-side management through
buildings' thermal inertia could shape the heating demand, yet has modest

  warming in radiative-convective equilibrium",2019-09-04T16:59:47Z,"Tristan H. Abbott, Timothy W. Cronin, Tom Beucler","Tropical precipitation extremes are expected to strengthen with warming, but
quantitative estimates remain uncertain because of a poor understanding of
changes in convective dynamics. This uncertainty is addressed here by analyzing
idealized convection-permitting simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium
in long-channel geometry. Across a wide range of climates, the thermodynamic
contribution to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows
near-surface moisture, and the dynamic contribution is positive and small, but
sensitive to domain size. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated with
precipitation extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors
strong vertical motion at levels where the vertical saturation specific
humidity gradient is large, and mass flux profiles collapse to a common shape
across climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate. The
collapse, robust to changes in microphysics and turbulence schemes, implies a
thermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite
substantial convergence aloft and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined
by the pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode
to vertical velocities from entraining plume models reveals that the small
dynamic mode in channel simulations (<~2 %/K) is caused by opposing
height-dependences of vertical velocity and density, together with the
buffering influence of cloud-base buoyancies that vary little with surface
temperature. These results reinforce an emerging picture of the response of
extreme tropical precipitation rates to warming: a thermodynamic mode of about
7 %/K dominates, with a minor contribution from changes in dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01941v4

$100$ thousand years around $1$ million years ago, called the Middle
Pleistocene Transition (MPT), lacks a conclusive explanation. We describe a
dynamical mechanism which we call Ramping with Frequency Locking (RFL), that
explains the transition by an interaction between the internal period of a
self-sustained oscillator and forcing that contains periodic components. This
mechanism naturally explains the abrupt increase in cycle length from
approximately $40$ to $80$ thousand years observed in proxy data, unlike some
previously proposed mechanisms for the MPT. A rapid increase in durations can
be produced by a rapid change in an external parameter, but this assumes rather
than explains the abruptness. In contrast, models relying on frequency locking
can produce a rapid change in durations assuming only a slow change in an
external parameter. We propose a scheme for detecting RFL in complex,

Optimal Investment to Enable Evolutionary Rescue,2019-02-23T18:48:29Z,"Jaime Ashander, Lisa C. Thompson, James N. Sanchirico, Marissa L. Baskett","'Evolutionary rescue' is the potential for evolution to enable population
persistence in a changing environment. Even with eventual rescue, evolutionary
time lags can cause the population size to temporarily fall below a threshold
susceptible to extinction. To reduce extinction risk given human-driven global
change, conservation management can enhance populations through actions such as
captive breeding. To quantify the optimal timing of, and indicators for
engaging in, investment in temporary enhancement to enable evolutionary rescue,
we construct a model of coupled demographic-genetic dynamics given a moving
optimum. We assume 'decelerating change', as might be relevant to climate
change, where the rate of environmental change initially exceeds a rate where
evolutionary rescue is possible, but eventually slows. We analyze the optimal
control path of an intervention to avoid the population size falling below a
threshold susceptible to extinction, minimizing costs. We find that the optimal
path of intervention initially increases as the population declines, then
declines and ceases when the population growth rate becomes positive, which
lags the stabilization in environmental change. In other words, the optimal
strategy involves increasing investment even in the face of a declining
population, and positive population growth could serve as a signal to end the
intervention. In addition, a greater carrying capacity relative to the initial
population size decreases the optimal intervention. Therefore, a one-time
action to increase carrying capacity, such as habitat restoration, can reduce
the amount and duration of longer-term investment in population enhancement,

Gain Stabilization of SiPMs with an Adaptive Power Supply,2019-02-17T13:40:16Z,"G. Eigen, J. Cvach, J. Kvasnicka, I. Polak, A. Tr√¶et, J. Zalieckas","The gain of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) increases with bias voltage and
decreases with temperature. To operate SiPMs at stable gain, the bias voltage
can be readjusted to compensate for temperature changes. We have tested this
concept with 30 SiPMs from three manufacturers (Hamamatsu, KETEK and CPTA)
operating in a climate chamber at CERN by varying temperatures between $1^\circ

"Exponentially decaying modes and long-term prediction of sea ice
  concentration using Koopman Mode Decomposition",2019-11-04T19:01:35Z,"James Hogg, Maria Fonoberova, Igor Mezic","Sea ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic is an important indicator of
changes in the climate, with important environmental, economic and security

it difficult to assess the temporal nature of the changes - e.g. linear or
exponential - and their precise geographical loci. In this study, Koopman Mode
Decomposition (KMD) was applied to satellite data of sea ice concentration for
the northern and southern hemispheres to gain insight into the temporal and
spatial dynamics of the sea ice behavior and to predict future sea ice
behavior. We discover exponentially decaying spatial modes in both hemispheres

"Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Reliable Wireless Sensor Networks in
  Dynamic Underground Environments",2019-08-16T01:01:39Z,"Hongzhi Guo, Bincy Ben","Wireless underground sensor networks play an important role in underground
sensing such as climate-smart agriculture and underground infrastructure

not practical since the dielectric parameters of soil change frequently due to
precipitation and harsh weather. This challenge cannot be ignored in real
implementation due to the drastic change of wireless underground channel. In
this paper, we study the effect of dynamic underground environment on wireless
communications for sensor networks. We use the real data collected by in-situ
sensors to train a Hidden Markov Model. Then, by using reinforcement learning,
we derive the optimal transmission policies for underground sensors to
efficiently use their energy and reduce the number of dropped and
unsuccessfully transmitted packets. Through simulations using real data, we
find that the developed algorithm can reduce the packet loss and transmit the

Endogenous Coalition Formation in Policy Debates,2019-03-25T13:03:14Z,"Philip Leifeld, Laurence Brandenberger","Political actors form coalitions around their joint normative beliefs in
order to influence the policy process on contentious issues such as climate
change or population ageing. Policy process theory maintains that learning
within and across coalitions is a central predictor of coalition formation and
policy change but has yet to explain how policy learning works. The present
article explains the formation and maintenance of coalitions by focusing on the
ways actors adopt policy beliefs from other actors in policy debates. A policy
debate is a complex social system in which temporal network dependence guides
how actors contribute ideological statements to the debate. Belief adoption
matters in three complementary ways: bonding, which exploits cues within
coalitions; bridging, which explores new beliefs outside one's perimeter in the
debate; and repulsion, which reinforces polarization between coalitions and
cements their belief systems. We formalize this theory of endogenous coalition
formation in policy debates and test it on a micro-level empirical dataset
using statistical network analysis and event history analysis.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05327v2
A New Mathematical Framework for Atmospheric Blocking Events,2019-02-22T12:29:26Z,"Valerio Lucarini, Andrey Gritsun","We use a simple yet Earth-like atmospheric model to propose a new framework
for understanding the mathematics of blocking events. Analysing error growth
rates along a very long model trajectory, we show that blockings are associated
with conditions of anomalously high instability of the atmosphere.
Additionally, the lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with the
intensity of such an anomaly, against intuition. In the case of Atlantic
blockings, predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the
blocking, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the mature
phase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability
is lowest in the mature phase. We associate blockings to a specific class of
unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes of variability that cover the
attractor of the system. The UPOs differ substantially in terms of instability,
which explains the diversity of the atmosphere in terms predictability. The
UPOs associated to blockings are indeed anomalously unstable, which leads to
them being rarely visited. The onset of a blocking takes place when the
trajectory of the system hops into the neighbourhood of one of these special
UPOs. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood
of usual, less unstable UPOs associated with zonal flow. This justifies the
classical Markov chains-based analysis of transitions between weather regimes.
The existence of UPOs differing in the dimensionality of their unstable
manifold indicates a very strong violation of hyperbolicity in the model, which
leads to a lack of structural stability. We propose that this is could be a
generic feature of atmospheric models and might be a fundamental cause behind
difficulties in representing blockings for the current climate and
uncertainties in predicting how their statistics will change as a result of
climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08464v3

  the future with implications in climate change mitigation",2019-10-03T14:55:11Z,"Josep Perell√≥, Miquel Montero, Jaume Masoliver, J. Doyne Farmer, John Geanakoplos","High future discounting rates favor inaction on present expending while lower
rates advise for a more immediate political action. A possible approach to this
key issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal
interest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and
finally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific
stochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which
inflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in
many epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known
model in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic
dynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become
negative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14
countries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an
error analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in
our results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run
discount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates. Even if one
rejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our results support
the need to consider low discounting rates. The results provided by these
fourteen countries significantly increase the priority of confronting global
actions such as climate change mitigation. We finally extend the analysis by
first allowing for fluctuations of the mean level in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
model and secondly by considering modified versions of the Feller and lognormal
models. In both cases, results remain basically unchanged thus demonstrating
the robustness of the results presented.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01928v2

compression of audio signals in the context of monitoring elephants in
sub-Saharan Africa. Earth's biodiversity is increasingly under threat by
sources of anthropogenic change (e.g. resource extraction, land use change, and
climate change) and surveying animal populations is critical for developing
conservation strategies. However, manually monitoring tropical forests or deep
oceans is intractable. For species that communicate acoustically, researchers
have argued for placing audio recorders in the habitats as a cost-effective and
non-invasive method, a strategy known as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). In
collaboration with conservation efforts, we construct a large labeled dataset
of passive acoustic recordings of the African Forest Elephant via
crowdsourcing, compromising thousands of hours of recordings in the wild. Using
state-of-the-art techniques in artificial intelligence we improve upon
previously proposed methods for passive acoustic monitoring for classification
and segmentation. In real-time detection of elephant calls, network bandwidth
quickly becomes a bottleneck and efficient ways to compress the data are
needed. Most audio compression schemes are aimed at human listeners and are
unsuitable for low-frequency elephant calls. To remedy this, we provide a novel
end-to-end differentiable method for compression of audio signals that can be
adapted to acoustic monitoring of any species and dramatically improves over
naive coding strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09069v1
"Modeling and simulation of heat source trajectories through phase-change
  materials",2019-09-19T09:28:27Z,Alexander Gary Zimmerman,"The modeling and simulation of heat source trajectories through phase-change
materials is a relevant problem both for space exploration and for terrestrial
climate research, among other fields. In space, the DLR and NASA are both
interested in exploring beneath the surfaces of icy moons, primarily Enceladus
and Europa, where conditions may alloy for extraterrestrial life. On Earth,
unique sub-glacial aquatic ecosystems offer potential for geo-biological
discoveries. Unfortunately, existing ice-drilling technology is dirty and
cumbersome.
  Melting probes are a clean and compact alternative technology which use
heaters to melt through the ice. A melting probe's trajectory can be controlled
with differential heating. Successful trajectory control requires advancements
not only in the modeling and simulation of the ambient dynamics, but also of
the probe's coupled rigid body dynamics. Fundamentally, the rigid body dynamics
can be modeled by the equations of motion; but this approach is prohibitively
complex.
  This work proposes an approach which exploits that the motion of the probe is
driven by contact with the evolving liquid-solid interface. From this
perspective, an energy minimization problem is formulated. The general
mathematical problem is formulated as two split operators, respectively for the
rigid body dynamics and the ambient dynamics. These operators are coupled with
feasibility constraints which ensure that the probe does not penetrate the
solid. Concrete examples are shown both for the energy minimization problem and
for the unsteady ambient dynamics. Finally, an algorithm is presented for the
temporal coupling of the split operators, which is implemented using Python and
C++. Example trajectories are shown, including the dynamic response of the
probe velocity to a rapid change in the heat flux.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08882v1
"Towards the prediction of critical transitions in spatially extended
  populations with cubical homology",2019-12-02T19:00:05Z,"Laura S. Storch, Sarah L. Day","The prediction of critical transitions, such as extinction events, is vitally
important to preserving vulnerable populations in the face of a rapidly
changing climate and continuously increasing human resource usage. Predicting
such events in spatially distributed populations is challenging because of the
high dimensionality of the system and the complexity of the system dynamics.
Here, we reduce the dimensionality of the problem by quantifying spatial
patterns via Betti numbers ($\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$), which count particular
topological features in a topological space. Spatial patterns representing
regions occupied by the population are analyzed in a coupled patch population
model with Ricker map growth and nearest-neighbors dispersal on a
two-dimensional lattice. We illustrate how Betti numbers can be used to
characterize spatial patterns by type, which in turn may be used to track
spatiotemporal changes via Betti number time series and characterize asymptotic
dynamics of the model parameter space. En route to a global extinction event,
we find that the Betti number time series of a population exhibits
characteristic changes. We hope these preliminary results will be used to aide
in the prediction of critical transitions in spatially extended systems.
Additional applications of this technique include analysis of spatial data
(e.g., GIS) and model validation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01021v1

In the case of tunnel diode circuits, noise-induced switching behavior is
associated with negative differential resistance in the static current-voltage
characteristics and bistability, i.e., the existence of two macroscopic current
states for a given applied voltage. Noise effects are particularly strong near
the onset and offset of bistable current behavior, corresponding to bifurcation
points in the associated dynamical system. In this paper, we show that the
tunnel diode system provides an excellent experimental platform for the

even the climate itself. Answering questions regarding these phenomena requires
robust tools for the detection and identification of these structures. In this
article, we use transfer operator ideas to develop a novel method for the
identification of weakly-mixing coherent volumes in oceanic velocity field data

longer time periods. We employ a time-centralized transfer operator approach
with practical modifications to identify potential structures in predetermined

a method that preserves the geometric structure of the data objects, thus
keeping the physical appearance of the data-set as close as possible to imaged

models. However, by applying extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
at pressure and temperature conditions similar to those in Earth's upper
mantle, we found that carbonic acid can be the most abundant carbon species in
aqueous CO$_2$ solutions at ~10 GPa and 1000 K. The mole percent of carbonic
acid in total dissolved carbon species increases with increasing pressure along
an isotherm, while its mole percent decreases with increasing temperature along
an isobar. In CO$_2$-rich solutions, we found significant proton transfer
between carbonic acid molecules and bicarbonate ions, which may enhance the

perturbations as a quantification of sensitivity. Alongside previous work, here
we use the transfer operator formalism to study the response and sensitivity of
a dynamical system undergoing perturbations. By projecting the transfer
operator onto a suitable finite dimensional vector space, one is able to obtain
matrix representations which determine finite Markov processes. Further, using
perturbation theory for Markov matrices, it is possible to determine the linear

distant social networks. Recursive incentive schemes have shown promise for
social search by motivating people to use their weak ties to find distant
targets, such as specific people or even weather balloons placed at undisclosed
locations. Here, we report on a case study of a similar recursive incentive
scheme for finding innovative ideas. Specifically, we implemented a competition

proposals and to submit high quality proposals. Furthermore, we find suggestive
evidence that among the contributors referred via the contest, those who had
more than one degree of separation from a pre-existing CoLab member were more
likely to submit high quality proposals. Thus, the results from this case study
are consistent the theory that people from distant networks are more likely to

detecting snowfall than rainfall, on average by 10 percent. In particular, the
probability of precipitation detection and its solid phase increases by 11 and

capacity expansion optimization based on technology cost projections and CO2
emission restrictions using 11 years of VRE and load data in Italy's power

indicate high renewables penetration even in the absence of decarbonization
policies. In the transition to zero carbon system, CCS plays a minor role due
to its carbon capture efficiency. ESS investments contribute to lower system
costs by replacing more expensive flexibility resources. However, longer ESS
durations have lower marginal value per added kWh ESS. Interannual variability
of VRE substantially changes the system's configuration and energy cost.

Bayesian inference framework is proposed for quantifying errors in reported
positions and their implications on SST estimates. The analysis framework is
applied to data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
(ICOADS3.0) in 1885, a time when astronomical and chronometer estimation of
position was common, but predating the use of radio signals. Focus is upon a
subset of 943 ship tracks from ICOADS3.0 that report their position every two
hours to a precision of 0.01{\deg} longitude and latitude. These data are
interpreted as positions determined by dead reckoning that are periodically
updated by celestial correction techniques. The posterior medians of
uncertainties in celestial correction are 33.1 km (0.30{\deg} on the equator)
in longitude and 24.4 km (0.22{\deg}) in latitude, respectively. The posterior
medians of two-hourly dead reckoning uncertainties are 19.2% for ship speed and
13.2{\deg} for ship heading, leading to random position uncertainties with
median 0.18{\deg} (20 km on the equator) in longitude and 0.15{\deg} (17 km) in
latitude. Reported ship tracks also contain systematic position uncertainties
relating to precursor dead-reckoning positions not being updated after
obtaining celestial position estimates, indicating that more accurate positions

policy challenge, and evaluating the efficacy of such policy efforts is crucial
for policy learning and adaptation. Deforestation in high-income nations can
contribute substantially to global forest loss, despite the presence of strong
institutions and high policy capacity. In Queensland, Australia, over 5 million
hectares of native forest has been lost since 1988. Successive regulatory
policies have aimed to reduce deforestation in Queensland, though debate exists
over their effect given the influence of other drivers of forest loss. Using a
hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework, we combine satellite imagery of
forest loss with macroeconomic, land tenure, biophysical and climatic variables
to collectively model deforestation for 50 local government areas (LGAs) across
Queensland. We apply the spatially explicit bent-cable regression model to
detect trend change that may signal a regulatory policy effect. We find that
annual % growth in GDP was the only clear driver of LGA-specific deforestation
after adjusting for other covariate effects. Our model shows strong evidence of
spatial contagion in deforestation across Queensland, and this effect is
influenced by the dominant land tenure type within each LGA. We find our model
exhibits a ""bend"" mostly between 2000 and 2007, consistent with expectations,
but the signal is not particularly strong due extreme variation in
deforestation trends between and within LGAs. Our results demonstrate that the
bent-cable model is a promising technique for detecting system changes in
response to policy interventions, but future work should be conducted at a
national scale to provide more data points, and incorporate more LGA-specific
data to improve model goodness-of-fit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09365v1

predicting how changes in underlying factors at a given location affect
urbanization outcomes at other locations, is currently not achievable at a
large scale with traditional urban growth models, which are either too
simplistic, or depend on detailed locally-collected socioeconomic data that is

comparative static analysis are provided by the backpropagation algorithm used
to train the model. This framework allows to naturally incorporate physical
constraints, e.g., the inability to build over water bodies. To validate the
spatial structure of model-generated built environment distributions, we use

large rotating generator masses provides stabilizing inertia,
inverter-connected generation does not. Since the underlying power system and
the control mechanisms that keep it close to a desired reference state, were
not designed for such a low inertia system, this might make the system
vulnerable to disturbances. In this paper, we will investigate whether the
currently used control mechanisms are able to keep a low inertia system stable
and how this is effected by the time delay between a frequency deviation and
the onset of the control action. We integrate the control mechanisms used in
continental Europe into a model of coupled oscillators which resembles the
second order Kuramoto model. This model is then used to investigate how the
interplay of changing inertia, network topology and delayed control effects the

  Temperature",2019-02-21T19:47:51Z,"Shineng Hu, Geoffrey K. Vallis","We use a simple, semi-analytic, column model to better understand the
meridional structure of the tropopause height and the future changes in its
height and temperature associated with global warming. The model allows us to
separate the effects of tropospheric lapse rate (TLR), optical depth, outgoing
longwave radiation (OLR) and stratospheric cooling on the tropopause height.
When applied locally at each latitudinal band the model predicts the overall
meridional structure of the tropopause height, with a tropical tropopause
substantially higher than that in higher latitudes and a sharp transition at
the edge of the extratropics. The large optical depth of the tropics, due
mainly to the large water vapour path (WVP), is the dominant tropospheric
effect producing the higher tropical tropopause, whereas the larger tropical
lapse rate acts to lower the tropopause height. The dynamical cooling induced
by the stratospheric circulation further lifts the thermal tropopause in the
tropics resulting in it being significantly cooler and higher than in mid- and
high latitudes. The model quantifies the causes of the tropopause height
increase with global warming that is robustly found in climate integrations
from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The large spread
in the increase rate of tropopause height in the CMIP5 models is captured by
the simple model, which attributes the dominant contributions to changes in WVP
and TLR, with changes in CO2 concentration and OLR having much smaller effects.
The CMIP5 models also show a small but robust increase in the tropopause
temperature in low latitudes, with a much smaller increase in higher latitudes.
We suggest that the tropical increase may in part be caused by non-grey effects
in the radiative transfer associated with the higher levels of water vapour in
the tropics, with near constant tropopause temperatures predicted otherwise.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08230v1
"A lifestyle-based model of household neighbourhood location and
  individual travel mode choice behaviours",2019-02-06T00:41:08Z,"Ali Ardeshiri, Akshay Vij","Issues such as urban sprawl, congestion, oil dependence, climate change and
public health, are prompting urban and transportation planners to turn to land
use and urban design to rein in automobile use. One of the implicit beliefs in
this effort is that the right land-use policies will, in fact, help to reduce
automobile use and increase the use of alternative modes of transportation.
Thus, planners and transport engineers are increasingly viewing land use
policies and lifestyle patterns as a way to manage transportation demand. While
a substantial body of work has looked at the relationship between the built
environment and travel behaviour, as well as the influence of lifestyles and
lifestyle-related decisions on using different travel modes and activity
behaviours, limited work has been done in capturing these effects
simultaneously and also in exploring the effect of intra-household interaction
on individual attitudes and beliefs towards travel and activity behavior, and
their subsequent influence on lifestyles and modality styles. Therefore, for
this study we proposed a framework that captures the concurrent influence of
lifestyles and modality styles on both household-level decisions, such as
neighbourhood location, and individual-level decisions, such as travel mode
choices using a hierarchical Latent Class Choice Model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01986v2
"A new dynamical core of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model
  with a height-based terrain-following vertical coordinate",2019-02-07T18:04:40Z,"Syed Zahid Husain, Claude Girard, Abdessamad Qaddouri, Andre Plante","A new dynamical core of Environment and Climate Change Canada's Global
Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model is presented. Unlike the
existing log-hydrostatic-pressure-type terrain-following vertical coordinate,
the proposed core adopts a height-based approach. The move to a height-based
vertical coordinate is motivated by its potential for improving model stability
over steep terrain, which is expected to become more prevalent with the
increasing demand for very high resolution forecasting systems. A dynamical
core with height-based vertical coordinate generally requires an iterative
solution approach. In addition to a three-dimensional iterative solver, a
simplified approach has been devised allowing the use of a direct solver for
the new dynamical core that separates a three-dimensional elliptic boundary
value problem into a set of two-dimensional independent Helmholtz problems. The
new dynamical core is evaluated using numerical experiments that include
two-dimensional nonhydrostatic theoretical cases as well as 25-km resolution
global forecasts. For a wide range of horizontal grid resolutions---from a few
meters to up to 25 km---the results from the direct solution approach is found
to be equivalent to the iterative approach for the new dynamical core.
Furthermore, results from the numerical experiments confirm that the new
height-based dynamical core leads to results that are equivalent to the
existing pressure-based core.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03958v1

this study. In particular, we pay attention to the scarcely discussed issue of
storm tide inundation. The main procedures of hazard assessment are: 1)
non-stationary tropical cyclone intensification (TCI) and sea level rise (SLR)
for the study area are analyzed based on the long-term historical database; 2)
four typical scenarios of storm tide are examined using the surge-tide-wave
coupled hydrodynamic model; 3) the potential inundated regions are identified
on the GIS platform. The distributions of water elevation show that high water
elevation tends to occur in the bays and around the estuaries. Without
considering the impacts of TCI and SLR, the maximal water elevations caused by
the typhoon wind of 100-year recurrence period can reach as high as 6.06 m,
5.82 m and 5.67 m around Aojiang, Feiyunjiang and Oujiang river estuaries,
respectively. In this circumstance, about 533 km2 area is under the threat of
storm tide inundation. TCI and SLR due to climate change can further
deteriorate the situation and enhance the risk of inundation there. The maximal
water elevations at the aforementioned three estuaries considering the
potential non-stationary TCI and SLR in 2100s can be as high as 7.02m, 6.67 m,
6.44m, respectively. The corresponding potential inundation area expands by 50%
compared with the situation without considering TCI and SLR. In addition, the
remotely sensed maps and inundation durations of the hardest hit regions are
provided as well.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06198v1
Improved Representation of Ocean Heat Content in Energy Balance Models,2019-02-27T23:43:23Z,"Balasubramanya T. Nadiga, Nathan M. Urban","Anomaly-diffusing energy balance models (AD-EBM) are routinely employed to
analyze and emulate the warming response of both observed and simulated Earth
systems. We demonstrate a deficiency in common multi-layer as well as
continuous-diffusion AD-EBM variants: They are unable to, simultaneously,
properly represent surface warming and the vertical distribution of heat
uptake. We show that this inability is due to the diffusion approximation. On
the other hand, it is well understood that transport of water from the surface
mixed layer into the ocean interior is achieved, in large part, by the process
of ventilation---a process associated with outcropping isopycnals. We,
therefore, start from a configuration of outcropping isopycnals and demonstrate
how an AD-EBM can be modified to include the effect of ventilation on ocean
uptake of anomalous radiative forcing. The resulting EBM is able to
successfully represent both surface warming and the vertical distribution of
heat uptake, and indeed, a simple four layer model suffices. The simplicity of
the models notwithstanding, the analysis presented and the necessity of the
modification highlight the role played by processes related to the down-welling
branch of global ocean circulation in shaping the vertical distribution of
ocean heat uptake.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10836v1

  joint spatio-temporal point process framework",2019-10-31T23:43:16Z,"Joe Watson, Ruth Joy, Dominic Tollit, Sheila J Thornton, Marie Auger-M√©th√©","Models of the spatial distribution of animals provide useful tools to help
ecologists quantify species-environment relationships, and they are
increasingly being used to help determine the impacts of climate and habitat
changes on species. While high-quality survey-style data with known effort are
sometimes available, often researchers have multiple datasets of varying
quality and type. In particular, collections of sightings made by citizen
scientists are becoming increasingly common, with no information typically
provided on their observer effort. Many standard modelling approaches ignore
observer effort completely, which can severely bias estimates of an animal's
distribution. Combining sightings data from observers who followed different
protocols is challenging. Any differences in observer skill, spatial effort,
and the detectability of the animals across space all need to be accounted for.
To achieve this, we build upon the recent advancements made in integrative
species distribution models and present a novel marked spatio-temporal point
process framework for estimating the utilization distribution (UD) of the
individuals of a highly mobile species. We show that in certain settings, we
can also use the framework to combine the UDs from the sampled individuals to
estimate the species' distribution. We combine the empirical results from a
simulation study with the implications outlined in a causal directed acyclic
graph to identify the necessary assumptions required for our framework to
control for observer effort when it is unknown. We then apply our framework to
combine multiple datasets collected on the endangered Southern Resident Killer
Whales, to estimate their monthly effort-corrected space-use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00151v2

  Vehicle Battery Degradation",2019-11-04T18:43:33Z,"Mehdi Jafari, Laura E. Brown, Lucia Gauchia","This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic
estimation of the electric vehicle battery capacity fade. Since the battery
aging factors such as temperature, current, and state of charge are not fixed,
and they change in different times, locations and by the different users,
deterministic models with constant parameters cannot accurately evaluate the
battery capacity fade. Therefore, a probabilistic presentation of the capacity
fade including uncertainties of the measurements or observations of the
variables can be a proper solution. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian
Network model for the electric vehicle battery capacity fade considering
multiple external variables. The mathematical expression of the model is
extracted based on Bayes theorem, the probability distributions for all
variables and their dependencies are carefully chosen where the Metropolis
Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate the
posterior distributions. The model is trained with 85 percent of experimental
data to obtain its unseen parameters and tested with other 15 percent of data
to prove its accuracy. Also, three case studies for different drivers,
different grid services frequencies, and different climates are explored to
show model flexibility with different input data. The developed model needs
training data for parameter tuning in different conditions. However, after
training, it has more than 95 percent precision in estimating the battery

management such as prescribed burning within constrained areas or advancements
for reactive fire management (e.g., fire suppression). Because of the growing
societal impact, the JPL BlueSky program sought to assess the current state of
fire management and technology and determine areas with high return on

  environments with seasonality",2019-11-25T15:07:49Z,"Lukas Eigentler, Jonathan A. Sherratt","Vegetation patterns are a characteristic feature of semi-deserts occurring on
all continents except Antarctica. In some semi-arid regions, the climate is
characterised by seasonality, which yields a synchronisation of seed dispersal
with the dry season or the beginning of the wet season. We reformulate the
Klausmeier model, a reaction-advection-diffusion system that describes the
plant-water dynamics in semi-arid environments, as an integrodifference model
to account for the temporal separation of plant growth processes during the wet
season and seed dispersal processes during the dry season. The model further
accounts for nonlocal processes involved in the dispersal of seeds. Our
analysis focusses on the onset of spatial patterns. The Klausmeier partial
differential equations (PDE) model is linked to the integrodifference model in
an appropriate limit, which yields a control parameter for the temporal
separation of seed dispersal events. We find that the conditions for pattern
onset in the integrodifference model are equivalent to those for the continuous
PDE model and hence independent of the time between seed dispersal events. We
thus conclude that in the context of seed dispersal, a PDE model provides a
sufficiently accurate description, even if the environment is seasonal. This
emphasises the validity of results that have previously been obtained for the
PDE model. Further, we numerically investigate the effects of changes to seed
dispersal behaviour on the onset of patterns. We find that long-range seed
dispersal inhibits the formation of spatial patterns and that the seed
dispersal kernel's decay at infinity is a significant regulator of patterning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10964v2

patterns, have led to more frequent outbreaks of plant disease epidemics
worldwide. Mathematical modelling is a key tool in predicting where and how
these new threats will spread, as well as in assessing how damaging they might
be. Models can also be used to inform disease management, providing a rational
methodology for comparing the performance of possible control strategies
against one another. For emerging epidemics, in which new pathogens or pathogen
strains are actively spreading into new regions, the spatial component of
spread becomes particularly important, both to make predictions and to optimise
disease control. In this chapter we illustrate how the spatial spread of
emerging plant diseases can be modelled at the landscape scale via spatially
explicit compartmental models. Our particular focus is on the crucial role of
the dispersal kernel-which parameterises the probability of pathogen spread
from an infected host to susceptible hosts at any given distance-in determining
outcomes of epidemics. We add disease management to our model by testing
performance of a simple ''one off'' form of reactive disease control, in which
sites within a particular distance of locations detected to contain infection
are removed in a single round of disease management. We use this simplified
model to show how ostensibly arcane decisions made by the modeller-most notably
whether or not the underpinning disease model allows for stochasticity (i.e.
randomness)-can greatly impact on disease management recommendations. Our
chapter is accompanied by example code in the programming language R available

management. Several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the
dynamics of demand, and hence a single statistical model that only consists of
historical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts. In
practice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often
judgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information
that are not incorporated in the baseline models. There are however systematic
events whose effect can be effectively quantified and modeled to help minimize
human intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we
develop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic
information/events and objectively incorporate them into the baseline
statistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit
forecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such
as sudden climate change or dynamic market activities. The proposed model and
approach is validated empirically using sales and promotional data from two
Australian companies. Discussions focus on a thorough analysis of the

behavior of the stratosphere has not been studied in detail. Understanding the
snowball stratosphere is important for developing an accurate account of the
Earth's radiative and chemical properties during these episodes. Here we
conduct the first analysis of the stratospheric circulation of the Snowball

zonal jets, and is extremely cold relative to modern conditions. Notably, the
snowball stratosphere displays no sudden stratospheric warmings. Without ozone,
the stratosphere displays slightly weaker circulation, a complete lack of polar
vortex, and even colder temperatures. We also explicitly quantify for the first
time the cross-tropopause mass exchange rate and stratospheric mixing
efficiency during the snowball and show that our values do not change the

Impact of pressure dissipation on fluid injection into layered aquifers,2019-01-11T15:52:16Z,"Luke T. Jenkins, Martino Foschi, Christopher W. MacMinn","Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and subsurface storage is one method for
reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change. It is well
known that large-scale fluid injection into the subsurface leads to a buildup
in pressure that gradually spreads and dissipates through lateral and vertical
migration of water. This dissipation can have an important feedback on the
shape of the CO2 plume during injection, and the impact of vertical pressure
dissipation, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the
impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation on the injection of CO2
into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model that
couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We
show that our vertically integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of
efficiently and accurately capturing water migration in a layered aquifer
system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases ---
`no leakage' and `strong leakage' --- in which we derive analytical expressions
for the water pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection
problem. We demonstrate that pressure dissipation acts to suppress the
formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, resulting in a plume
with a reduced lateral extent. The properties of the seals and the number of
aquifers determine the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling
with the CO2 plume. The impact of pressure dissipation on the shape of the CO2
plume is likely to be important for storage efficiency and security.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03623v2

"Identification of synoptic weather types over Taiwan area with multiple
  classifiers",2019-05-21T16:29:27Z,"Shih-Hao Su, Jung-Lien Chu, Ting-Shuo Yo, Lee-Yaw Lin","In this study, a novel machine learning approach was used to classify three
types of synoptic weather events in Taiwan area from 2001 to 2010. We used
reanalysis data with three machine learning algorithms to recognize weather
systems and evaluated their performance. Overall, the classifiers successfully
identified 52-83% of weather events (hit rate), which is higher than the
performance of traditional objective methods. The results showed that the
machine learning approach gave low false alarm rate in general, while the
support vector machine (SVM) with more principal components of reanalysis data
had higher hit rate on all tested weather events. The sensitivity tests of grid
data resolution indicated that the differences between the high- and
low-resolution datasets are limited, which implied that the proposed method can
achieve reasonable performance in weather forecasting with minimal resources.
By identifying daily weather systems in historical reanalysis data, this method
can be used to study long-term weather changes, to monitor climatological-scale
variations, and to provide a better estimate of climate projections.
Furthermore, this method can also serve as an alternative to model output
statistics and potentially be used for synoptic weather forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08736v1

regions, directly impacting the mass balance of the ice caps. The only water
supply in Antarctica, precipitation, is poorly estimated from surface
measurements. The onboard cloud-profiling radar of the CloudSat satellite
provided the first real opportunity to estimate precipitation at continental
scale. Based on CloudSat observations, we propose to explore the vertical
structure of precipitation in Antarctica over the 2007-2010 period. A first
division of this dataset following a topographical approach (continent versus
peripheral regions, with a 2250m topographical criterion) shows a high
precipitation rate (275mm/yr at 1200meters above ground level) with low
relative seasonal variation (+/-11%) over the peripheral areas. Over the
plateau, the precipitation rate is low (34mm/yr at 1200m.a.g.l.) with a much
larger relative seasonal variation (+/-143%). A second study that follows a
geographical division highlights the average vertical structure of
precipitation and temperature depending on the regions and their interactions
with topography. In particular, over ice-shelves, we see a strong dependence of
the distribution of precipitation on the sea-ice coverage. Finally, the
relationship between precipitation and temperature is analyzed and compared
with a simple analytical relationship. This study highlights that precipitation
is largely dependent on the advection of air masses along the topographic
slopes with an average vertical wind of 0.02m/s. This provides new diagnostics
to evaluate climate models with a three-dimensional approach of the atmospheric
structure of precipitation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00457v2
Venus: Key to understanding the evolution of terrestrial planets,2019-08-07T13:48:13Z,"Colin Frank Wilson, Thomas Widemann","As we become aware of Earth's changing climate, and as we discover
terrestrial planets in other solar systems, we gain ever more reasons to study
the Earth's nearest neighbour and closest sibling, the only Earth-sized planet
besides our own that can be reached by our spacecraft. For the scientific and
programmatic reasons outlined in this document, Venus is a compelling target
for exploration. The science themes important for Venus research - comparative
planetology and planetary evolution - are common to all of planetary and
exoplanetary science. Many of the payloads required - radar and atmospheric
remote sensing, in situ mass spectrometers - are common to mission proposals
for many other solar system targets, as are mission technologies like high rate
deep-space telecommunications technologies. Venus-specific technology
developments meriting special attention include high-temperature systems and
balloons. Venus is an excellent proving ground for fundamental understanding of
geophysical processes of terrestrial planets; an excellent proving ground for
techniques of analysis of exoplanets; an indispensable part of our quest to
understand the evolution of Earthlike planets. For all these reasons, Venus
will be an ever more compelling theme in the coming decades, and we therefore
recommend its inclusion in the Voyage 2050 plan. We recommend that ESA aim to
have launched at least two M-class Venus missions by 2050, including the
EnVision M5 geophysics orbiter, and an in situ element such as a cloud-level

Gas injection and leakage in layered aquifers,2019-08-21T23:08:35Z,"Luke T. Jenkins, Martino Foschi, Christopher W. MacMinn","Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into saline aquifers is one method of
mitigating anthropogenic climate change. To ensure secure storage of this CO2,
it is important to understand the interaction of CO2 injection and migration
with geological layering. For example, seismic monitoring at the Sleipner pilot
project suggests that the injected CO2 is ponding against, and leaking across,
a series of thin, intermediate seals. Here, we develop a gravity-current model
for weakly compressible, two-phase fluid migration in a system of layered
aquifers. Our model includes vertical leakage of both water and gas across
seals, where the latter is subject to a capillary entry threshold. We
demonstrate that the buildup of capillary pressure is very sensitive to the
conductivity and connectivity of water films in the gas region. We identify two
associated limiting cases, where gas obstructs water flow either completely or
not at all. We then explore the parameters that govern gas leakage and the
resulting fluid distributions---demonstrating that this problem involves a
complex interplay between pressure dissipation, capillary pressure buildup, and
fluid migration. We show that decreasing the relative permeability of water in
the gas region can initiate gas leakage or significantly increase the amount of
gas leakage. Finally, we apply our model to rock properties expected for
Sleipner and show that CO2 injection may build up sufficient capillary pressure
to invade the seals---suggesting that, contrary to conventional wisdom, CO2 may
be able to leak across the intermediate seals at Sleipner in the absence of a
focused conduit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08137v1

analyzed the applicability and performance of four modern deep learning

using predictions of the groundwater level in Butte County, California, USA,
taking into account the temporal variability of streamflow, precipitation, and
ambient temperature. Our numerical study shows that the optimization of the
hyperparameters can lead to reasonably accurate performance of all models (root
mean squared errors of groundwater predictions of 2 meters or less), but the
''simplest'' network, namely a multilayer perceptron (MLP) performs overall
better for learning and predicting groundwater data than the more advanced long
short-term memory or convolutional neural networks in terms of prediction
accuracy and time-to-solution, making the MLP a suitable candidate for
groundwater prediction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10947v3

  Application to the InSight Measurements",2019-10-10T12:42:35Z,"Nicholas Attree, Narissa Patel, Axel Hagermann, Matthias Grott, Tilman Spohn, Matthew Siegler","Heat flow is an important constraint on planetary formation and evolution. It
has been suggested that Martian obliquity cycles might cause periodic collapses
in atmospheric pressure, leading to corresponding decreases in regolith thermal
conductivity (which is controlled by gas in the pore spaces). Geothermal heat
would then build up in the subsurface, potentially affecting present-day heat
flow - and thus the measurements made by a heat-flow probe such as the InSight
HP$^{3}$ instrument. To gauge the order of magnitude of this effect, we model
the diffusion of a putative heat pulse caused by thermal conductivity changes
with a simple numerical scheme and compare it to the heat-flow perturbations
caused by other effects. We find that an atmospheric collapse to 300 Pa in the
last 40 kyr would lead to a present-day heat flow that is up to $2-8\%$ larger
than the average geothermal background. Considering the InSight mission with
expected $5-15\%$ error bars on the HP$^{3}$ measurement, this perturbation
would only be significant in the best-case scenario of full instrument
deployment, completed measurement campaign, and a well-modelled surface
configuration. The prospects for detecting long-term climate perturbations via
spacecraft heat-flow experiments remain challenging.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04520v1
Machine Learning for Generalizable Prediction of Flood Susceptibility,2019-10-15T04:31:39Z,"Chelsea Sidrane, Dylan J Fitzpatrick, Andrew Annex, Diane O'Donoghue, Yarin Gal, Piotr Bili≈Ñski","Flooding is a destructive and dangerous hazard and climate change appears to
be increasing the frequency of catastrophic flooding events around the world.
Physics-based flood models are costly to calibrate and are rarely generalizable
across different river basins, as model outputs are sensitive to site-specific
parameters and human-regulated infrastructure. In contrast, statistical models
implicitly account for such factors through the data on which they are trained.
Such models trained primarily from remotely-sensed Earth observation data could
reduce the need for extensive in-situ measurements. In this work, we develop
generalizable, multi-basin models of river flooding susceptibility using
geographically-distributed data from the USGS stream gauge network. Machine
learning models are trained in a supervised framework to predict two measures
of flood susceptibility from a mix of river basin attributes, impervious
surface cover information derived from satellite imagery, and historical
records of rainfall and stream height. We report prediction performance of
multiple models using precision-recall curves, and compare with performance of
naive baselines. This work on multi-basin flood prediction represents a step in

"Coalition-structured governance improves cooperation to provide public
  goods",2019-10-24T02:13:43Z,"V√≠tor V. Vasconcelos, Phillip M. Hannam, Simon A. Levin, Jorge M. Pacheco","While the benefits of common and public goods are shared, they tend to be
scarce when contributions are provided voluntarily. Failure to cooperate in the
provision or preservation of these goods is fundamental to sustainability
challenges, ranging from local fisheries to global climate change. In the real
world, such cooperative dilemmas occur in multiple interactions with complex
strategic interests and frequently without full information. We argue that
voluntary cooperation enabled across multiple coalitions (akin to
polycentricity) not only facilitates greater generation of non-excludable
public goods, but may also allow evolution toward a more cooperative, stable,
and inclusive approach to governance. Contrary to any previous study, we show
that these merits of multi-coalition governance are far more general than the
singular examples occurring in the literature, and are robust under diverse
conditions of excludability, congestability of the non-excludable public good,
and arbitrary shapes of the return-to-contribution function. We first confirm
the intuition that a single coalition without enforcement and with players
pursuing their self-interest without knowledge of returns to contribution is
prone to cooperative failure. Next, we demonstrate that the same pessimistic
model but with a multi-coalition structure of governance experiences relatively
higher cooperation by enabling recognition of marginal gains of cooperation in
the game at stake. In the absence of enforcement, public-goods regimes that
evolve through a proliferation of voluntary cooperative forums can maintain and
increase cooperation more successfully than singular, inclusive regimes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11337v1
The Prosumer Economy -- Being Like a Forest,2019-03-16T12:56:19Z,Uygar Ozesmi,"Planetary life support systems are collapsing due to climate change and the
biodiversity crisis. The root cause is the existing consumer economy, coupled
with profit maximisation based on ecological and social externalities. Trends
can be reversed, civilisation may be saved by transforming the profit
maximising consumer economy into an ecologically and socially just economy,
which we call the prosumer economy. Prosumer economy is a macro scale circular
economy with minimum negative or positive ecological and social impact, an
ecosystem of producers and prosumers, who have synergistic and circular
relationships with deepened circular supply chains, networks, where leakage of
wealth out of the system is minimised. In a prosumer economy there is no waste,
no lasting negative impacts on the ecology and no social exploitation. The
prosumer economy is like a lake or a forest, an economic ecosystem that is
productive and supportive of the planet. We are already planting this forest
through Good4Trust.org, started in Turkey. Good4Trust is a community platform
bringing together ecologically and socially just producers and prosumers.
Prosumers come together around a basic ethical tenet the golden rule and share
on the platform their good deeds. The relationship are already deepening and
circularity is forming to create a prosumer economy. The platforms software to
structure the economy is open source, and is available to be licenced to start
Good4Trust anywhere on the planet. Complexity theory tells us that if enough
agents in a given system adopt simple rules which they all follow, the system
may shift. The shift from a consumer economy to a prosumer economy has already
started, the future is either ecologically and socially just or bust.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07615v1
Quantile Diffusions for Risk Analysis,2019-12-23T14:27:51Z,"Holly Brannelly, Andrea Macrina, Gareth W. Peters","We develop a novel approach for the construction of quantile processes
governing the stochastic dynamics of quantiles in continuous time. Two classes
of quantile diffusions are identified: the first, which we largely focus on,
features a dynamic random quantile level and allows for direct interpretation
of the resulting quantile process characteristics such as location, scale,
skewness and kurtosis, in terms of the model parameters. The second type are
function-valued quantile diffusions and are driven by stochastic parameter
processes, which determine the entire quantile function at each point in time.
By the proposed innovative and simple -- yet powerful -- construction method,
quantile processes are obtained by transforming the marginals of a diffusion
process under a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile
function. Such maps, analogous to rank transmutation maps, produce the
marginals of the resulting quantile process. We discuss the relationship and
differences between our approach and existing methods and characterisations of
quantile processes in discrete and continuous time. As an example of an
application of quantile diffusions, we show how probability measure
distortions, a form of dynamic tilting, can be induced. Though particularly
useful in financial mathematics and actuarial science, examples of which are
given in this work, measure distortions feature prominently across multiple
research areas. For instance, dynamic distributional approximations
(statistics), non-parametric and asymptotic analysis (mathematical statistics),
dynamic risk measures (econometrics), behavioural economics, decision making
(operations research), signal processing (information theory), and not least in
general risk theory including applications thereof, for example in the context
of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10866v3
Effects of Radius and Gravity on the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone,2019-04-28T07:02:00Z,"Huanzhou Yang, Thaddeus D. Komacek, Dorian S. Abbot","A rigorous definition of the habitable zone and its dependence on planetary
properties is part of the search for habitable exoplanets. In this work, we use
the general circulation model ExoCAM to determine how the inner edge of the
habitable zone of tidally locked planets orbiting M dwarf stars depends on
planetary radius, surface gravity, and surface pressure. We find that the inner
edge of the habitable zone for more massive planets occurs at higher stellar
irradiation, as found in previous one-dimensional simulations. We also
determine the relative effects of varying planetary radius and surface gravity.
Increasing the planetary radius leads to a lower planetary albedo and warmer
climate, pushing the inner edge of the habitable zone to lower stellar
irradiation. This results from a change in circulation regime that leads to the
disruption of the thick, reflective cloud deck around the substellar point.
Increasing gravity increases the outgoing longwave radiation, which moves the
inner edge of the habitable zone to higher stellar irradiation. This is because
the column mass of water vapor decreases with increasing gravity, leading to a
reduction in the greenhouse effect. The effect of gravity on the outgoing
longwave radiation is stronger than the effect of radius on the planetary
albedo, so that increasing gravity and radius together causes the inner edge of
the habitable zone to move to higher stellar irradiation. Our results show that
the inner edge of the habitable zone for more massive terrestrial planets
occurs at a larger stellar irradiation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12267v1
A ruin model with a resampled environment,2019-06-07T06:05:56Z,"Corina Constantinescu, Guusje Delsing, Michel Mandjes, Leonardo Rojas Nandayapa","This paper considers a Cram\'er-Lundberg risk setting, where the components
of the underlying model change over time. These components could be thought of
as the claim arrival rate, the claim-size distribution, and the premium rate,
but we allow the more general setting of the cumulative claim process being
modelled as a spectrally positive L\'evy process. We provide an intuitively
appealing mechanism to create such parameter uncertainty: at Poisson epochs we
resample the model components from a finite number of $d$ settings. It results
in a setup that is particularly suited to describe situations in which the risk
reserve dynamics are affected by external processes (such as the state of the
economy, political developments, weather or climate conditions, and policy
regulations). We extend the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg approximation
(asymptotically characterizing the all-time ruin probability in a light-tailed
setting) to this more general setup. In addition, for the situation that the
driving L\'evy processes are sums of Brownian motions and compound Poisson
processes, we find an explicit uniform bound on the ruin probability, which can
be viewed as an extension of Lundberg's inequality; importantly, here it is not
required that the L\'evy processes be spectrally one-sided. In passing we
propose an importance-sampling algorithm facilitating efficient estimation, and
prove it has bounded relative error. In a series of numerical experiments we
assess the accuracy of the asymptotics and bounds, and illustrate that
neglecting the resampling can lead to substantial underestimation of the risk.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02911v1

state network (a type of reservoir computing, RC-ESN), deep feed-forward
artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network with long
short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of
nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale ($X$),
intermediate ($Y$), and fast/small-scale ($Z$) processes. For training or
testing, only $X$ is available; $Y$ and $Z$ are never known or used. We show
that RC-ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN-LSTM for short-term
prediction, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds
of numerical solver's time steps, equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales.
The RNN-LSTM and ANN show some prediction skills as well; RNN-LSTM bests ANN.
Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by RC-ESN and
RNN-LSTM have probability density functions (PDFs) that closely match the true
PDF, even at the tails. The PDF of the data predicted using ANN, however,
deviates from the true PDF. Implications, caveats, and applications to
data-driven and data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical

the interval at which high resolution images are recorded spans over several

daily. We collect an extensive dataset of both, high and low resolution images
taken by PROBA-V instruments during monthly periods to investigate Multi Image
Super-resolution, a technique to merge several low resolution images to one
image of higher quality. We propose a convolutional neural network that is able
to cope with changes in illumination, cloud coverage and landscape features
which are challenges introduced by the fact that the different images are taken
over successive satellite passages over the same region. Given a bicubic
upscaling of low resolution images taken under optimal conditions, we find the
Peak Signal to Noise Ratio of the reconstructed image of the network to be
higher for a large majority of different scenes. This shows that applied

Geochemistry constrains global hydrology on Early Mars,2019-07-18T17:15:20Z,"Edwin S. Kite, Mohit Melwani Daswani","Ancient hydrology is recorded by sedimentary rocks on Mars. The most
voluminous sedimentary rocks that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are
sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the $Opportunity$ rover from 2004-2012 and soon
to be investigated by the $Curiosity$ rover at Gale crater. A leading
hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived
from evaporation of deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation
of groundwater. Global groundwater circulation would imply sustained warm
Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation of groundwater including
infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere
implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO$_2$
sequestration implied by the global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of
sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the $Opportunity$ data are
representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that (even
accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This
disfavors the hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were
derived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. If, instead, Hesperian
sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the CO$_2$
sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the
hypothesis that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from
upwelling of deep sourced groundwater. In both cases, carbon sequestration by
global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate surface
habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions.
$Curiosity$ will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two
hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate cation composition, carbon isotopes,
and climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08166v1

decisions of an airplane. A real pilot must take care not only about the
information arising from the cockpit (airspeed, altitude, variometer,
compass...) but also from outside the cabin. Throughout a flight, a pilot is
constantly in communication with the control tower to follow orders, because
there is an airspace regulation to respect. In addition, if the control tower
sends orders while the pilot has an emergency, he may have to violate these
orders and airspace regulations to solve his problem (e.g. emergency landing).
On the other hand, climate changes constantly (wind, snow, hail..) and can
affect the sensors. All these cases easily lead to contradictions. Switching to
reasoning under uncertainty, a pilot must make decisions to carry out a flight.
The objective of this implementation is to validate a non-monotonic model which
allows to solve the question of incomplete and contradictory information. We
formalize the problem using default logic, a non-monotonic logic which allows
to find fixed-points in the face of contradictions. For the implementation, the

life beyond the Solar system will be chosen. The target selection process will
require the leveraging of all available information in order to maximise the
robustness of the target list and make the most productive use of follow-up
resources. Here, we present the results of a suite of $n$-body simulations that
demonstrate the degree to which the orbital architecture of the Solar system
impacts the variability of Earth's orbital elements. By varying the orbit of
Jupiter and keeping the initial orbits of the other planets constant, we
demonstrate how subtle changes in Solar system architecture could alter the
Earth's orbital evolution -- a key factor in the Milankovitch cycles that alter
the amount and distribution of solar insolation, thereby driving periodic
climate change on our planet. The amplitudes and frequencies of Earth's modern
orbital cycles fall in the middle of the range seen in our runs for all
parameters considered -- neither unusually fast nor slow, nor large nor small.
This finding runs counter to the `Rare Earth' hypothesis, which suggests that
conditions on Earth are so unusual that life elsewhere is essentially
impossible. Our results highlight how dynamical simulations of newly discovered
exoplanetary systems could be used as an additional means to assess the
potential targets of biosignature searches, and thereby help focus the search

need for new observations of sea ice dynamics. Remote sensing as well as
mathematical and numerical models of wave propagation in sea ice would benefit
from more in situ data for validation. This study presents wave measurements in
the marginal ice zone (MIZ) obtained from ship mounted sensors. The system
combines altimeter readings from the ship bow with ship motion correction data
to provide estimated single point ocean surface elevation. Significant wave
height and mean wave period, as well as one-dimensional wave spectra are
derived from the combined measurements. The results are compared with
integrated parameters from a spectral wave model over a period of eight days in
the open ocean, and with spectra and integrated parameters derived from motion
detecting instruments placed on ice floes inside the MIZ. Mean absolute errors
of the integrated parameters are in the range 15.0-18.9% when comparing with
the spectral wave model and 1.0-9.6% when comparing with valid motion detecting
instruments. The spatial wave damping coefficient is estimated by looking at
the change in spectral wave amplitude found at discrete frequency values as the
ship was moving along the longitudinal direction of the MIZ within time
intervals where the wave field is found to be approximately constant in time.
As expected from theory, high frequency waves are effectively dampened by the
presence of sea ice. The observed wave attenuation rates compare favourably
with a two-layer dissipation model. Our methodology can be regarded as a simple
and reliable way to collect more waves-in-ice data as it can be easily added to
any ship participating to ice expeditions, at little extra cost.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07612v2

socio-cultural processes (e.g. voting on climate policies or changing social

  mobility space and place?",2019-05-07T16:25:12Z,"Alec Biehl, Ying Chen, Karla Sanabria-Veaz, David Uttal, Amanda Stathopoulos","Encouraging sustainable mobility patterns is at the forefront of policymaking
at all scales of governance as the collective consciousness surrounding climate
change continues to expand. Not every community, however, possesses the
necessary economic or socio-cultural capital to encourage modal shifts away
from private motorized vehicles towards active modes. The current literature on
`soft' policy emphasizes the importance of tailoring behavior change campaigns
to individual or geographic context. Yet, there is a lack of insight and
appropriate tools to promote active mobility and overcome transport
disadvantage from the local community perspective. The current study
investigates the promotion of walking and cycling adoption using a series of
focus groups with local residents in two geographic communities, namely
Chicago's (1) Humboldt Park neighborhood and (2) suburb of Evanston. The
research approach combines traditional qualitative discourse analysis with
quantitative text-mining tools, namely topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
The analysis uncovers the local mobility culture, embedded norms and values
associated with acceptance of active travel modes in different communities. We
observe that underserved populations within diverse communities view active
mobility simultaneously as a necessity and as a symbol of privilege that is
sometimes at odds with the local culture. The mixed methods approach to
analyzing community member discourses is translated into policy findings that
are either tailored to local context or broadly applicable to curbing
automobile dominance. Overall, residents of both Humboldt Park and Evanston
envision a society in which multimodalism replaces car-centrism, but
differences in the local physical and social environments would and should
influence the manner in which overarching policy objectives are met.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02674v1

direct human use, is leading to an accelerated process of change and
deterioration of the marine ecosystems. Human activities such as fishing
together with environmental drivers (e.g. climate change) are triggering major
threats to marine biodiversity, and impact directly the services they provide.
In the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, the deep-water crustacean trawl
fishery is not exemption. This fishery is recognized to have large effects on a
number of species while generating high rates of unwanted catches. However,
taking into account an ecosystem-based perspective, the fishing impacts along
the food web accounting for biological interactions between and among species
caught remains poorly understood. These impacts are particularly troubling and
are a cause of concern given the cascading effects that might arise. Facing the
main policies and legislative instruments for the restoration and conservation
of the marine environment, times are calling for implementing ecosystem-based
approaches to fisheries management. To this end, we use a food web modelling
(Ecopath with Ecosim) approach to assess the fishing impacts of this particular
fishery on the marine ecosystem of southern and southwestern Portugal. In
particular, we describe the food web structure and functioning, identify the
main keystone species and/or groups, quantify the major trophic and energy
flows, and ultimately assess the impact of fishing on the target species but
also on the ecosystem by means of ecological and ecosystem-based indicators.

to correctly interpret changes in climatic and environmental variables such as

products with the gridded, ground-based EFFIS dataset for Mediterranean Europe

and temporal similarities at different aggregations to identify a spatial scale
at which most of the observations provide equivalent results. The results of
the analysis indicate that the datasets show high temporal correlation with
each other (0.5/0.6) when aggregating the data at resolution of at least
1.0{\deg} or at NUTS3 level. However, burned area estimates vary widely between
datasets. Filtering out satellite fires located on urban and crop land cover
classes greatly improves the agreement with EFFIS data. Finally, in spite of
the differences found in the area estimates, the spatial pattern is similar for
all the datasets, with spatial correlation increasing as the resolution
decreases. Also, the general reasonable agreement between satellite products
builds confidence in using these datasets and in particular the most-recent
developed dataset, FireCCI51, shows the best agreement with EFFIS overall. As a
result, the main conclusion of the study is that users should carefully
consider the limitations of the satellite fire estimates currently available,
as their uncertainties cannot be neglected in the overall uncertainty

that removing fires on human-dominated land areas is key to analyze forest

enabling the supply of energy to communities in line with the goals of
sustainable development. Accordingly, the establishment of the concept of
sustainable, decentralised, multi-carrier energy systems, together with the
declining costs of renewable energy technologies, has proposed changes in the
energy industry towards the development of integrated energy systems.
Notwithstanding the potential benefits, the optimal capacity planning of these

triggered by CO/CH4 transition with radiative transfer in the atmospheres of
brown dwarfs is analog to moist and thermohaline convection. We derive a
generalization of the mixing length theory to include the effect of source
terms in 1D codes. We show that CO/CH4 radiative convection could significantly
reduce the temperature gradient in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs similarly to
moist convection in Earth atmosphere thus possibly explaining the reddening in
brown-dwarf spectra. By using idealized two-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations in the Ledoux unstable regime, we show that compositional source
terms can indeed provoke a reduction of the temperature gradient. The L/T

analog of the boiling crisis in liquid/steam-water convective flows. This
mechanism with other chemical transitions could be present in many giant and

Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships,
even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse
irradiation limit (around 1.1~times the insolation at Earth for planets
orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in
condensed form and would instead form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we
use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive new mass-radius
relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated
than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a
steam, water-dominated atmosphere. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these
new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than
calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using
traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than
the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate --
possibly by several orders of magnitude -- their bulk water content. In
particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can
accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08 %, respectively,
assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show
that significant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and

such miniaturisation. Reagent payload for >3 yr operation is a critical
parameter. The precise injection of acid into sample, liberating CO2 from

restrictors and asymmetric Y meters were fabricated to adjust the metering
ratio between seawater and acid simulants. Laser etching conditions were varied
to create a range of channel dimensions down to ~75 microns. Channel flow
versus pressure measurements were used to determine hydrodynamic resistances

important components of the oceanic carbon sink. Carbon rich water from
shelf-seas is exported at depth to the open ocean, a process known as the
continental shelf pump, with open-ocean surface water moving (transported) onto
the shelf driving the export at depth. Existing methods to study shelf-wide
exchange focus on the wind or geostrophic currents, often ignoring their
combined effect, spatial heterogeniety or any other ageostrophic components.
Here we investigate the influence that wind, wave and current interactions can
have on surface transport and carbon export across continental shelves. Using a
21 year global re-analysis dataset we confirm that geostrophic and wind driven
Ekman processes are important for the transport of water onto shelf seas; but
the dominance of each is location and season dependent. A global wave model
re-analysis shows that one type of ageostrophic flow, Stokes drift due to
waves, can also be significant. A regional case study using two submesocale
model simulations identifies that up to 100% of the cross-shelf surface flow in
European seas can be due to ageostrophic components. Using these results and
grouping shelf-seas based on their observed carbon accumulation rates shows
that differences in rates are consistent with imbalances between the processes
driving atmosphere-ocean exchange at the surface and those driving carbon
export at depth. Therefore expected future changes in wind and wave climate
support the need to monitor cross-shelf transport and the size of the
continental shelf-sea carbon pump. The results presented show that the Sea

How much of the Solar System should we leave as Wilderness?,2019-05-24T19:35:45Z,"Martin Elvis, Tony Milligan","""How much of the Solar System should we reserve as wilderness, off-limits to
human development?"" We argue that, as a matter of policy, development should be
limited to one eighth, with the remainder set aside. We argue that adopting a
""1/8 principle"" is far less restrictive, overall, than it might seem. One
eighth of the iron in the asteroid belt is more than a million times greater
than all of the Earth's estimated iron reserves and may suffice for centuries.
A limit of some sort is needed because of the problems associated with
exponential growth. Humans are poor at estimating the pace of such growth, so
the limitations of a resource are hard to recognize before the final three
doubling times which take utilization successively from 1/8 to 1/4 to 1/2, and
then to the point of exhaustion. Population growth and climate change are
instances of unchecked exponential growth. Each places strains upon ouru
available resources. Each is a problem we would like to control but attempts to
do so at this comparatively late stage have not been encouraging. Our limited
ability to see ahead suggests that we should set ourselves a 'tripwire' that
gives us at least 3 doubling times as leeway, i.e. when 1/8 of Solar System
resources are close to being exploited. At a 3.5 percent growth rate for the
space economy, comparable to that of the iron use from the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution until now, the 1/8 point would be reached after 400
years. At that point the 20 year doubling time of a 3.5 percent growth rate
means that only 60 years would remain to transition the economic system to new
""steady state"" conditions. The rationale for adopting the 1/8 principle now is
that it may be far easier to implement in principle restrictions at an early
stage, rather than later, when vested and competing interests have come into
existence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13681v1

the 365-nm brightness and cloud-tracking wind variations, obtained by the UV
Imager onboard the Japanese Venus Climate Orbiter Akatsuki from June to October
2017, revealing a dramatic evolution of planetary-scale waves and corresponding
changes in planetary-scale UV features. We identified a prominent 5-day
periodicity in both the winds and brightness variations, whose phase velocities
were slower than the dayside mean zonal winds (or the super-rotation) by >35 m

symmetric and centered at ~35{\deg} latitude in both hemispheres, which
indicated that they were part of a Rossby wave. The amplitude of winds
variation associated with the observed Rossby wave packet were amplified
gradually over ~20 days and attenuated over ~50 days. Following the formation
of the Rossby wave vortices, brightness variation emerges to form rippling
white cloud belts in the 45{\deg}-60{\deg} latitudes of both hemispheres.
~3.8-day periodic signals were observed in the zonal wind and brightness

"Generative stochastic modeling of strongly nonlinear flows with
  non-Gaussian statistics",2019-08-20T20:10:41Z,"Hassan Arbabi, Themistoklis Sapsis","Strongly nonlinear flows, which commonly arise in geophysical and engineering
turbulence, are characterized by persistent and intermittent energy transfer
between various spatial and temporal scales. These systems are difficult to
model and analyze due to combination of high dimensionality and uncertainty,
and there has been much interest in obtaining reduced models, in the form of
stochastic closures, that can replicate their non-Gaussian statistics in many
dimensions. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to model stationary
chaotic dynamical systems through nonlinear transformations and a set of
decoupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we use
optimal transport to find a transformation from the distribution of time-series
data to a multiplicative reference probability measure such as the standard
normal distribution. Then we find the set of decoupled SDEs that admit the
reference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match the spectrum
of the transformed data. As such, this framework represents the chaotic time
series as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a
nonlinear map. We demonstrate the application of this framework in Lorenz-96
system, a 10-dimensional model of high-Reynolds cavity flow, and reanalysis
climate data. These examples show that SDE models generated by this framework
can reproduce the non-Gaussian statistics of systems with moderate dimensions
(e.g. 10 and more), and predict super-Gaussian tails that are not readily
available from little training data. These findings suggest that this class of
models provide an efficient hypothesis space for learning strongly nonlinear
flows from small amounts of data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08941v5

electricity and water infrastructure that enable the production, distribution,

power is used to produce, treat, distribute, and recycle water while water is
used to generate and consume electricity. In the meantime, significant
attention has been given to renewable energy integration within the context of
global climate change. While these two issues may seem unrelated, their
resolution is potentially synergistic in that renewable energy technologies not
only present low CO2 emissions but also low water-intensities. Furthermore,
because water is readily stored, it has the potential to act as a flexible
energy resource on both the supply and the demand-side of the electricity grid.
Despite these synergies, the renewable energy integration and energy-water
nexus literature have yet to methodologically converge to systematically
address potential synergies. This paper advances an enterprise control

key to the development of appropriate mitigation strategies and numerical
models. In this study, we unveil the diurnal dynamics of the microclimate of a
Buxus sempervirens plant using multiple high-resolution non-intrusive imaging
techniques. The wake flow field is measured using stereoscopic particle image
velocimetry, the spatiotemporal leaf temperature history is obtained using
infrared thermography, and additionally, the plant porosity is obtained using
X-ray tomography. We find that the wake velocity statistics is not directly
linked with the distribution of the porosity but depends mainly on the geometry
of the plant foliage which generates the shear flow. The interaction between
the shear regions and the upstream boundary layer profile is seen to have a
dominant effect on the wake turbulent kinetic energy distribution. Furthermore,
the leaf area density distribution has a direct impact on the short-wave
radiative heat flux absorption inside the foliage where 50% of the radiation is
absorbed in the top 20% of the foliage. This localized radiation absorption
results in a high local leaf and air temperature. Furthermore, a comparison of

water during the formation, the co-evolution of the interior and the
atmosphere, as well as the stellar irradiation which changes in time. Since an
unknown number of rocky exoplanets may operate in a one-plate convective
regime, i.e., without plate tectonics, we aim at understanding under which
conditions planets in such a stagnant-lid regime may support habitable surface
conditions. Understanding the interaction of the planetary interior and
outgassing of volatiles with the atmosphere in combination with the evolution
of the host star is crucial to determine the potential habitability. M-dwarf
stars in particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase which
endangers the habitability of planets around them via water loss. We therefore
explore the potential of secondary outgassing from the planetary interior to
rebuild a water reservoir allowing for habitability at a later stage. We
compute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M, K, G, and F-dwarf stars
using a 1D cloud-free radiative-convective climate model accounting for the
outgassing history of CO2 and H2O from an interior evolution and outgassing
model for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity evolutions.
The outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO2
outgassed from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the
stellar irradiation, as soon as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been
outgassed. A build-up of a secondary water reservoir for planets around M-dwarf
stars is possible even after severe water loss during the high luminosity
pre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the
mantle. Earth-like stagnant-lid planets allow for habitable surface conditions

called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into
complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical
system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal
visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability
of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of
information called characteristic exponent, {\lambda} of degree distribution
and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The
authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its
origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of
streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and
comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics
characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of
streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the
analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence.
This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors
demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly
correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal

(equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This can be broken into
$\sim$15 ktCO$_2$-e/yr from supercomputer usage, $\sim$4.2 ktCO$_2$-e/yr from

"Consequences of glacial cycles for magmatism and carbon transport at
  mid-ocean ridges",2019-04-05T16:45:40Z,"Nestor G. Cerpa, David W. Rees Jones, Richard F. Katz","Magmatism and volcanism transfer carbon from the solid Earth into the climate
system. This transfer may be modulated by the glacial/interglacial cycling of
water between oceans and continental ice sheets, which alters the surface
loading of the solid Earth. The consequent volcanic-carbon fluctuations have
been proposed as a pacing mechanism for Pleistocene glacial cycles. This
mechanism is dependant on the amplitude and lag of the mid-ocean ridge response
to sea-level changes. Here we develop and analyse a new model for that
response, eliminating some questionable assumptions made in previous work. Our
model calculates the carbon flux, accounting for the thermodynamic effect of
mantle carbon: reduction of the solidus temperature and a deeper onset of
melting. We analyse models forced by idealised, periodic sea level and conclude
that fluctuations in melting rate are the prime control on magma and carbon
flux. We also discuss a model forced by a reconstruction of eustatic sea level
over the past 800 kyr. It indicates that peak-to-trough variations of magma and
carbon flux are up to about 20% and 10% of the mean flux, respectively. Peaks
in mid-ocean ridge emissions lag peaks in sea-level forcing by less than about
20 kyr and the lag could well be shorter. The amplitude and lag are sensitive
to the rate of melt segregation. The lag is much shorter than the time it takes
for melt to travel vertically across the melting region.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03154v2

offset the climate benefits of replacing coal with gas. Optical gas imaging
(OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive
and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this
paper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using
convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable
automatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane
leaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide
range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m).
Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the
methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants,
collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of
leaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by
comparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection
algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a
moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the
detection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can
exceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary
detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely
(~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater
than 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m),
performance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect
large leaks (>950 gCH4/h). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be
deployed in OGI surveys to allow automatic vigilance of methane leak detection

ArcticNet: A Deep Learning Solution to Classify Arctic Wetlands,2019-06-01T02:40:47Z,"Ziyu Jiang, Kate Von Ness, Julie Loisel, Zhangyang Wang","Arctic environments are rapidly changing under the warming climate. Of
particular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most
effective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon
that was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for
aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,
back to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this
transfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to
global warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a
positive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and
dynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.
However, the identification and delineation of these important wetland
ecosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of
Arctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,
coarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and
micro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic
wetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this
challenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic
Wetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural
network that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from
nanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM
project, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which
three Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold
efforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the
choice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of

distributions before and after a change. In particular, this is almost always
the case if only one parameter of the bivariate normal distribution changes,

the most sensitive for a large range of changes and pre-change settings in
higher dimensions as well. This motivates using the minor projections for

in streams of data. Increasingly, tools for change-point detection are applied
in settings where data may be highly sensitive and formal privacy guarantees
are required, such as identifying disease outbreaks based on hospital records,

emerged as a powerful technique for enabling data analysis while preventing
information leakage about individuals. Much of the prior work on change-point

complete knowledge of the pre-change and post-change distributions. However,
this assumption is not realistic for many practical applications of interest.
This work develops differentially private algorithms for solving the

distractors from semantic changes, localize the changes via Dual Attention over

observed extreme precipitation from 1950 to 2017 for the contiguous United

spatial statistical methods that allow us to derive gridded estimates that do
not smooth extreme daily measurements and are consistent with statistics from

Furthermore, we use a robust statistical technique to identify significant
pointwise changes in the climatology of extreme precipitation while carefully
controlling the rate of false positives. We present and discuss seasonal
changes in the statistics of extreme precipitation: the largest and most
spatially-coherent pointwise changes are in fall (SON), with approximately 33%

Therefore, in this paper we perform a thorough empirical analysis of bug-fixing

Change Detection with the Kernel Cumulative Sum Algorithm,2019-03-05T04:30:17Z,"Thomas Flynn, Shinjae Yoo","Online change detection involves monitoring a stream of data for changes in

dynamics of a target word. Our approach identifies these points by leveraging
both static and time-varying word embeddings to measure the influence of words

Triangulation Graph and Color Changing Channel,2019-01-10T06:55:15Z,Rundong Gan,"Triangulation graph staining is sufficient for planar graph staining. This
article will focus on triangulation and the nature of the color change channel

utilizes the transferability of edge dyeing to reflect the integrity of the
triangulation graph. According to the nature of the color change channel, two
constraints are obtained, so that the color change can be followed regularly.

Fr√©chet Change Point Detection,2019-11-26T22:20:39Z,"Paromita Dubey, Hans-Georg M√ºller","We propose a method to infer the presence and location of change-points in
the distribution of a sequence of independent data taking values in a general
metric space, where change-points are viewed as locations at which the
distribution of the data sequence changes abruptly in terms of either its
Fr\'echet mean or Fr\'echet variance or both. The proposed method is based on
comparisons of Fr\'echet variances before and after putative change-point
locations and does not require a tuning parameter except for the specification
of cut-off intervals near the endpoints where change-points are assumed not to

consistency of the estimated location of the change-point if it exists, where
under the null hypothesis of no change-point the limit distribution of the
proposed scan function is the square of a standardized Brownian Bridge. These

mild entropy conditions. Examples include the space of univariate probability
distributions and the space of graph Laplacians for networks. Simulation

code changes, since the change identification step, learning, and reuse in

primary studies about source code changes. The search approach identified 2410

The majority of approaches and techniques have used repetitiveness behavior of

"Curved surface geometry-induced topological change of an excitable
  planar wave",2019-05-08T06:15:49Z,"Kazuya Horibe, Ken-ichi Hironaka, Katsuyoshi Matsushita, Koichi Fujimoto","On the curved surfaces of living and nonliving materials, planar excitable
waves frequently exhibit directional change and subsequently undergo a
topological change; that is, a series of wave dynamics from fusion,
annihilation to splitting. Theoretical studies have shown that excitable planar
stable waves change their topology significantly depending on the initial
conditions on flat surfaces, whereas the directional-change of the waves occurs
based on the geometry of curved surfaces. However, it is not clear if the
geometry of curved surfaces induces this topological change. In this study, we
first show the curved surface geometry-induced topological changes in a planar
stable wave by numerically solving an excitable reaction-diffusion equation on
a bell-shaped surface. We determined two necessary conditions for inducing
topological change: the characteristic length of the curved surface (i.e.,
height of the bell-shaped structure) should be larger than the width of the
wave and than a threshold independent of the wave width. As for the geometrical
mechanism of the latter, we found that a bifurcation of the globally minimum
geodesics (i.e. minimal paths) on the curved surface leads to the topological
change. These conditions imply that wave topology changes can be predicted on
the basis of curved surfaces, whose structure is larger than the wave width.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02927v1
"Change Detection in Noisy Dynamic Networks: A Spectral Embedding
  Approach",2019-10-05T18:02:18Z,"Isuru Udayangani Hewapathirana, Dominic Lee, Elena Moltchanova, Jeanette McLeod","Change detection in dynamic networks is an important problem in many areas,
such as fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection and health care monitoring.
It is a challenging problem because it involves a time sequence of graphs, each
of which is usually very large and sparse with heterogeneous vertex degrees,
resulting in a complex, high dimensional mathematical object. Spectral
embedding methods provide an effective way to transform a graph to a lower
dimensional latent Euclidean space that preserves the underlying structure of
the network. Although change detection methods that use spectral embedding are
available, they do not address sparsity and degree heterogeneity that usually
occur in noisy real-world graphs and a majority of these methods focus on
changes in the behaviour of the overall network.
  In this paper, we adapt previously developed techniques in spectral graph
theory and propose a novel concept of applying Procrustes techniques to
embedded points for vertices in a graph to detect changes in entity behaviour.
Our spectral embedding approach not only addresses sparsity and degree
heterogeneity issues, but also obtains an estimate of the appropriate embedding
dimension. We call this method CDP (change detection using Procrustes
analysis). We demonstrate the performance of CDP through extensive simulation
experiments and a real-world application. CDP successfully detects various
types of vertex-based changes including (i) changes in vertex degree, (ii)
changes in community membership of vertices, and (iii) unusual increase or
decrease in edge weight between vertices. The change detection performance of
CDP is compared with two other baseline methods that employ alternative
spectral embedding approaches. In both cases, CDP generally shows superior
performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02301v1

  Multi-scale Convolutional Networks",2019-06-27T07:53:41Z,"Hongruixuan Chen, Chen Wu, Bo Du, Liangpei Zhang","Very-high-resolution (VHR) images can provide abundant ground details and
spatial geometric information. Change detection in multi-temporal VHR images
plays a significant role in urban expansion and area internal change analysis.
Nevertheless, traditional change detection methods can neither take full
advantage of spatial context information nor cope with the complex internal
heterogeneity of VHR images. In this paper, a powerful feature extraction model
entitled multi-scale feature convolution unit (MFCU) is adopted for change
detection in multi-temporal VHR images. MFCU can extract multi-scale
spatial-spectral features in the same layer. Based on the unit two novel deep
siamese convolutional neural networks, called as deep siamese multi-scale
convolutional network (DSMS-CN) and deep siamese multi-scale fully
convolutional network (DSMS-FCN), are designed for unsupervised and supervised
change detection, respectively. For unsupervised change detection, an automatic
pre-classification is implemented to obtain reliable training samples, then
DSMS-CN fits the statistical distribution of changed and unchanged areas from
selected training samples through MFCU modules and deep siamese architecture.
For supervised change detection, the end-to-end deep fully convolutional
network DSMS-FCN is trained in any size of multi-temporal VHR images, and
directly outputs the binary change map. In addition, for the purpose of solving
the inaccurate localization problem, the fully connected conditional random
field (FC-CRF) is combined with DSMS-FCN to refine the results. The
experimental results with challenging data sets confirm that the two proposed
architectures perform better than the state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11479v2
Fault-Diagnosing SLAM for Varying Scale Change Detection,2019-09-16T08:52:45Z,"Sugimoto Takuma, Yamaguchi Kousuke, Tanaka Kanji","In this paper, we present a new fault diagnosis (FD) -based approach for
detection of imagery changes that can detect significant changes as
inconsistencies between different sub-modules (e.g., self-localizaiton) of
visual SLAM. Unlike classical change detection approaches such as pairwise
image comparison (PC) and anomaly detection (AD), neither the memorization of
each map image nor the maintenance of up-to-date place-specific anomaly
detectors are required in this FD approach. A significant challenge that is
encountered when incorporating different SLAM sub-modules into FD involves
dealing with the varying scales of objects that have changed (e.g., the
appearance of small dangerous obstacles on the floor). To address this issue,
we reconsider the bag-of-words (BoW) image representation, by exploiting its
recent advances in terms of self-localization and change detection. As a key
advantage, BoW image representation can be reorganized into any different
scaling by simply cropping the original BoW image. Furthermore, we propose to
combine different self-localization modules with strong and weak BoW features
with different discriminativity, and to treat inconsistency between strong and
weak self-localization as an indicator of change. The efficacy of the proposed
approach for FD with/without AD and/or PC was experimentally validated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09592v1

Predictive Indexing,2019-01-21T20:16:47Z,"Joy Arulraj, Ran Xian, Lin Ma, Andrew Pavlo","There has been considerable research on automated index tuning in database
management systems (DBMSs). But the majority of these solutions tune the index
configuration by retrospectively making computationally expensive physical
design changes all at once. Such changes degrade the DBMS's performance during
the process, and have reduced utility during subsequent query processing due to
the delay between a workload shift and the associated change. A better approach
is to generate small changes that tune the physical design over time, forecast
the utility of these changes, and apply them ahead of time to maximize their
impact.
  This paper presents predictive indexing that continuously improves a
database's physical design using lightweight physical design changes. It uses a
machine learning model to forecast the utility of these changes, and
continuously refines the index configuration of the database to handle evolving
workloads. We introduce a lightweight hybrid scan operator with which a DBMS
can make use of partially-built indexes for query processing. Our evaluation
shows that predictive indexing improves the throughput of a DBMS by 3.5--5.2x

predictive indexing works seamlessly with other lightweight automated physical

  Recommendation Using Hidden Markov Models",2019-05-14T19:56:57Z,"Farzad Eskandanian, Bamshad Mobasher","In a variety of online settings involving interaction with end-users it is
critical for the systems to adapt to changes in user preferences. User
preferences on items tend to change over time due to a variety of factors such

long-term external factors. Recommender systems need to be able to capture
these dynamics in user preferences in order to remain tuned to the most current
interests of users. In this work we present a recommendation framework which
takes into account the dynamics of user preferences. We propose an approach

of user interactions which reflect significant changes in preference according
to the sequential behavior of all the users in the data. The proposed framework
leverages the identified change points to generate recommendations using a

Change-point detection in dynamic networks via graphon estimation,2019-08-05T19:50:20Z,"Zifeng Zhao, Li Chen, Lizhen Lin","We propose a general approach for change-point detection in dynamic networks.
The proposed method is model-free and covers a wide range of dynamic networks.
The key idea behind our approach is to effectively utilize the network
structure in designing change-point detection algorithms. This is done via an
initial step of graphon estimation, where we propose a modified neighborhood
smoothing~(MNBS) algorithm for estimating the link probability matrices of a
dynamic network. Based on the initial graphon estimation, we then develop a
screening and thresholding algorithm for multiple change-point detection in
dynamic networks. The convergence rate and consistency for the change-point
detection procedure are derived as well as those for MNBS. When the number of
nodes is large~(e.g., exceeds the number of temporal points), our approach
yields a faster convergence rate in detecting change-points comparing with an
algorithm that simply employs averaged information of the dynamic network
across time. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust performance of the
proposed algorithm for change-point detection under various types of dynamic
networks, and superior performance over existing methods is observed. A real

these problems. In the first stage, a multi-scale filtering building index

and moderate accuracy. In the second stage, images and the corresponding
building maps are partitioned into grids. In each grid, the ratio of building
areas in time T2 and time T1 is calculated. Each grid is classified into one of

The key to our proposed method is to create first a set of prior maps that can
characterize the changes in the image sequence due to illumination. We show
that they can be detected by a k-support norm. To deal with concurrent, two
types of changes, we employ two regularization terms, one for detecting moving

Invariant Diffs,2019-11-18T22:39:38Z,"Ashwin Kallingal Joshy, Wei Le","Software development is inherently incremental. Nowadays, many software
companies adopt an agile process and a shorter release cycle, where software
needs to be delivered faster with quality assurances. On the other hand, the
majority of existing program analysis tools still target single versions of
programs and are slow and inflexible to handle changes. In the popular version
control systems such as git, the program changes are still presented using
source code diffs. It is hard to understand what program conditions are changed
and which source code lines cause them. In this paper, we propose to compute
""invariant diffs"" to specify changes. Similar to source diffs that report
common code and code churns, we define version invariants to represent program
conditions that are common across versions, and invariant churns to show the
changes of program conditions between versions. We designed a static
demand-driven, path-sensitive analysis to compute and compare invariants for
multiple versions of programs using multiversion control flow graphs. We report
invariant diffs at the matched program points where comparing invariants are
meaningful. Importantly, our analysis correlates source diffs with invariant
diffs to explain what source code changes lead to the property changes. We
implemented our algorithms in a tool called $H_2$ and performed experiments on
104 versions of programs. Our results show that we are able to compute
invariant diffs correctly within reasonable amount of time. The version
invariants can capture the common properties of program versions even
constructed by different persons, and the invariant churns can specify the
semantics of changes such as how a patch changed a buggy condition to a correct
condition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07988v2

distance. We allow all the relevant parameters -- the minimal spacing between
two consecutive change points, the minimal magnitude of the changes in the
Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, and the number of sample points collected at each
time point -- to change with the length of time series. We generalize the
renowned binary segmentation (e.g. Scott and Knott, 1974) algorithm and its
variant, the wild binary segmentation of Fryzlewicz (2014), both originally
designed for univariate mean change point detection problems, to our
nonparametric settings and exhibit rates of consistency for both of them. In
particular, we prove that the procedure based on wild binary segmentation is
nearly minimax rate-optimal. We further demonstrate a phase transition in the
space of model parameters that separates parameter combinations for which
consistent localization is possible from the ones for which this task is
statistical unfeasible. Finally, we provide extensive numerical experiments to
support our theory. R code is available at https://github.com/hernanmp/NWBS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10019v1
Simple unity among the fundamental equations of science,2019-03-29T07:56:40Z,Steven A. Frank,"The Price equation describes the change in populations. Change concerns some
value, such as biological fitness, information or physical work. The Price
equation reveals universal aspects for the nature of change, independently of
the meaning ascribed to values. By understanding those universal aspects, we
can see more clearly why fundamental mathematical results in different
disciplines often share a common form. We can also interpret more clearly the
meaning of key results within each discipline. For example, the mathematics of
natural selection in biology has a form closely related to information theory
and physical entropy. Does that mean that natural selection is about
information or entropy? Or do natural selection, information and entropy arise
as interpretations of a common underlying abstraction? The Price equation
suggests the latter. The Price equation achieves its abstract generality by
partitioning change into two terms. The first term naturally associates with
the direct forces that cause change. The second term naturally associates with
the changing frame of reference. In the Price equation's canonical form, total
change remains zero because the conservation of total probability requires that
all probabilities invariantly sum to one. Much of the shared common form for
the mathematics of different disciplines may arise from that seemingly trivial
invariance of total probability, which leads to the partitioning of total
change into equal and opposite components of the direct forces and the changing
frame of reference.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00825v2
"Detection and estimation of parameters in high dimensional multiple

  discrete optimization",2019-06-11T05:15:24Z,"Abhishek Kaul, Venkata K Jandhyala, Stergios B Fotopoulos","Binary segmentation, which is sequential in nature is thus far the most
widely used method for identifying multiple change points in statistical
models. Here we propose a top down methodology called arbitrary segmentation
that proceeds in a conceptually reverse manner. We begin with an arbitrary
superset of the parametric space of the change points, and locate unknown
change points by suitably filtering this space down. Critically, we reframe the
problem as that of variable selection in the change point parameters, this
enables the filtering down process to be achieved in a single step with the aid
of an $\ell_0$ regularization, thus avoiding the sequentiality of binary
segmentation. We study this method under a high dimensional multiple change
point linear regression model and show that rates convergence of the error in
the regression and change point estimates are near optimal. We propose a
simulated annealing (SA) approach to implement a key finite state space
discrete optimization that arises in our method. Theoretical results are
numerically supported via simulations. The proposed method is shown to possess
the ability to agnostically detect the `no change' scenario. Furthermore, its
computational complexity is of order $O(Np^2)$+SA, where SA is the cost of a SA
optimization on a $N$(no. of change points) dimensional grid. Thus, the
proposed methodology is significantly more computationally efficient than
existing approaches. Finally, our theoretical results are obtained under weaker

this paper, we study multiple change-point localization in the high-dimensional

$\{ x_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^n$ where $ \{ x_t\}_{t=1}^n $ are $p$-dimensional

changes in temperature and concentration influence the conformational entropy

two black hole accretion phenomena are analogous. Previously, studies of the
correlation between the UV-to-X-ray spectral index alpha_OX and Eddington ratio

possible similarities to the spectral evolution of outbursting X-ray binaries.
However, direct comparisons using multi-epoch UV/X-ray light curves of
individual changing-look AGN undergoing dramatic changes in Eddington ratio
have been scarce. Here, we use published Swift UV/X-ray light curves of two
changing-look AGN (NGC 2617 and ZTF18aajupnt) to examine the evolution of their
alpha_OX values during outburst. We show that the combination of these two

binary outbursts, including the inversion in the evolution of alpha_OX as a
function of Eddington ratio. We suggest that the spectral softening that is
observed to occur below a critical Eddington ratio in both AGN and X-ray
binaries is due to reprocessing of Comptonized X-ray emission by the accretion
disk, based on the X-ray to UV reverberation lags previously observed in NGC

Change Detection with Sparse Signals using Quantum Designs,2019-01-24T11:16:34Z,"Aditi Jain, Pradeep Sarvepalli, Srikrishna Bhashyam, Arun Pachai Kannu","We consider the change detection problem where the pre-change observation
vectors are purely noise and the post-change observation vectors are
noise-corrupted compressive measurements of sparse signals with a common
support, measured using a sensing matrix. In general, post-change distribution
of the observations depends on parameters such as the support and variances of
the sparse signal. When these parameters are unknown, we propose two
approaches. In the first approach, we approximate the post-change pdf based on
the known parameters such as mutual coherence of the sensing matrix and bounds
on the signal variances. In the second approach, we parameterize the
post-change pdf with an unknown parameter and try to adaptively estimate this

of the observations, correlation values with columns of the sensing matrix and

matrices with small coherence by using designs from quantum information theory.
One such design, called SIC POVM, also has an additional structure which allows
exact computation of the post-change pdfs of some decision statistics even when

goals. Due to the dynamic nature of the surrounding world of these systems,
assuring the satisfaction of their properties at runtime and in the presence of
a change is important. A prominent approach to assure the correct behavior of
these systems is verification at runtime, which has strict time and memory
limitations. To tackle these limitations, we propose Magnifier, an iterative,
incremental, and compositional verification approach that operates on a
component-based model. The Magnifier idea is zooming on the component affected
by a change, verifying the correctness of properties of interest of the system
after adapting the component to the change, and then zooming out and tracing
the change if it propagates. If the change propagates, all components affected
by the change are adapted and are composed to form a new component. Magnifier
repeats the same process for the new component. This iterative process
terminates whenever the propagation of the change stops. In Magnifier, we use
the Coordinated Adaptive Actor model (CoodAA) of traffic control systems. We
present a formal semantics for CoodAA as a network of Timed Input-Output
Automata (TIOAs). The change does not propagate if TIOAs of the adapted

with semiconducting, semi-metallic, and metallic properties. The dynamic
control of these phases is of immediate interest for next generation
electronics such as phase change memories. Of the binary Mo and W-based TMDs,
MoTe2 is attractive for electronic applications because it has the lowest
energy difference (40 meV) between the semiconducting (2H) and semi-metallic
(1T') phases, allowing for MoTe2 phase change by electrostatic doping. Here we
report phase change between the 2H and 1T' polymorphs of MoTe2 in thicknesses
ranging from the monolayer case to effective bulk (73nm) using an ionic liquid
electrolyte at room temperature and in air. We find consistent evidence of a
partially reversible 2H-1T' transition using in-situ Raman spectroscopy where
the phase change occurs in the top-most layers of the MoTe2 flake. We find a
thickness-dependent transition voltage where higher voltages are necessary to
drive the phase change for thicker flakes. We also show evidence of
electrochemical activity during the gating process by observation of Te metal
deposition. This finding suggests the formation of Te vacancies which have been
reported to lower the energy difference between the 2H and 1T' phase,
potentially aiding the phase change process. Our discovery that the phase
change can be achieved on the surface layer of bulk materials reveals that this
electrochemical mechanism does not require isolation of a single layer and the
effect may be more broadly applicable than previously thought.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12746v1

unethical, or expensive. After all, doctor guidelines, tax codes, and price
lists can only be reprinted so often. We may thus want to only change a policy
when it is probable that the change is beneficial. In cases that a policy is a
threshold on contextual variables we can estimate treatment effects for
populations lying at the threshold. This allows for a schedule of incremental
policy updates that let us optimize a policy while making few detrimental
changes. Using this idea, and the theory of linear contextual bandits, we
present a conservative policy updating procedure which updates a deterministic
policy only when justified. We extend the theory of linear bandits to this
rarely-switching case, proving that such procedures share the same regret, up
to constant scaling, as the common LinUCB algorithm. However the algorithm
makes far fewer changes to its policy and, of those changes, fewer are
detrimental. We provide simulations and an analysis of an infant health
well-being causal inference dataset, showing the algorithm efficiently learns a
good policy with few changes. Our approach allows efficiently solving problems

When very slow is too fast -- collapse of a predator-prey system,2019-08-15T12:18:46Z,"Anna Vanselow, Sebastian Wieczorek, Ulrike Feudel","Critical transitions or regime shifts are sudden and unexpected changes in
the state of an ecosystem, that are usually associated with dangerous levels of
environmental change. However, recent studies show that critical transitions
can also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast
to classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not
involve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be
explained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that
the well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a
rate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the
habitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations.
Rather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is
slower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive
phenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with
the concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental
change with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters.
Moreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of
initial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results
suggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental
conditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical
transitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by
environmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are
slower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting
research question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are
predominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05507v1
Some algorithms for the mean curvature flow under topological changes,2019-08-26T14:00:35Z,"Arthur Bousquet, Yukun Li, Guanqian Wang","This paper considers and proposes some algorithms to compute the mean

well known that zero-level set of the Allen-Cahn equation approaches the mean
curvature flow before the onset of the topological changes; however, there are
few papers systematically studying the evolution of the mean curvature flow
under the topological changes. There are three main contributions of this
paper. First, in order to consider various random initial conditions, we design
several benchmark problems with topological changes, and we find different
patterns of the evolutions of the solutions can be obtained if the interaction
length (width of the interface) is slightly changed, which is different from
the problems without topological changes. Second, we propose an energy
penalized minimization algorithm which works very well for these benchmark
problems, and thus furthermore, for the problems with random initial
conditions. Third, we propose a multilevel minimization algorithm. This
algorithm is shown to be more tolerant of the unsatisfying initial guess when

redshift. This is also the first time the changing-look behaviour has been seen
in a high-ionisation emission line. SDSS J1205+3422, J1638+2827, and J2228+2201
show interesting behaviour in their observed optical light curves, and
subsequent spectroscopy shows significant changes in the C IV broad emission
line, with both line collapse and emergence being displayed on rest-frame
timescales of $\sim$240-1640 days. These are rapid changes, especially when
considering virial black hole mass estimates of $M_{\rm BH} > 10^{9} M_{\odot}$
for all three quasars. Continuum and emission line measurements from the three
quasars show changes in the continuum-equivalent width plane with the CLQs seen
to be on the edge of the full population distribution, and showing indications
of an intrinsic Baldwin effect. We put these observations in context with
recent state-change models, and note that even in their observed low-state, the
C IV CLQs are generally above $\sim$5\% in Eddington luminosity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05310v1
"A robust bootstrap change point test for high-dimensional location
  parameter",2019-04-06T06:16:01Z,"Mengjia Yu, Xiaohui Chen","We consider the problem of change point detection for high-dimensional
distributions in a location family when the dimension can be much larger than
the sample size. In change point analysis, the widely used cumulative sum
(CUSUM) statistics are sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed distributions. In
this paper, we propose a robust, tuning-free (i.e., fully data-dependent), and
easy-to-implement change point test that enjoys strong theoretical guarantees.
To achieve the robust purpose in a nonparametric setting, we formulate the
change point detection in the multivariate $U$-statistics framework with
anti-symmetric and nonlinear kernels. Specifically, the within-sample noise is
canceled out by anti-symmetry of the kernel, while the signal distortion under
certain nonlinear kernels can be controlled such that the between-sample change
point signal is magnitude preserving. A (half) jackknife multiplier bootstrap
(JMB) tailored to the change point detection setting is proposed to calibrate
the distribution of our $\ell^{\infty}$-norm aggregated test statistic. Subject
to mild moment conditions on kernels, we derive the uniform rates of
convergence for the JMB to approximate the sampling distribution of the test
statistic, and analyze its size and power properties. Extensions to multiple
change point testing and estimation are discussed with illustration from
numerical studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03372v3
"A Composite Likelihood-based Approach for Change-point Detection in
  Spatio-temporal Processes",2019-04-12T17:43:06Z,"Zifeng Zhao, Ting Fung Ma, Wai Leong Ng, Chun Yip Yau","This paper develops a unified and computationally efficient method for
change-point estimation along the time dimension in a non-stationary
spatio-temporal process. By modeling a non-stationary spatio-temporal process
as a piecewise stationary spatio-temporal process, we consider simultaneous
estimation of the number and locations of change-points, and model parameters
in each segment. A composite likelihood-based criterion is developed for
change-point and parameters estimation. Under the framework of increasing
domain asymptotics, theoretical results including consistency and distribution
of the estimators are derived under mild conditions. In contrast to classical
results in fixed dimensional time series that the localization error of
change-point estimator is $O_{p}(1)$, exact recovery of true change-points can
be achieved in the spatio-temporal setting. More surprisingly, the consistency
of change-point estimation can be achieved without any penalty term in the
criterion function. In addition, we further establish consistency of the number
and locations of the change-point estimator under the infill asymptotics
framework where the time domain is increasing while the spatial sampling domain
is fixed. A computationally efficient pruned dynamic programming algorithm is
developed for the challenging criterion optimization problem. Extensive
simulation studies and an application to U.S. precipitation data are provided

"Analyses of 'change scores' do not estimate causal effects in
  observational data",2019-07-05T10:42:38Z,"Peter W. G. Tennant, Kellyn F. Arnold, George T. H. Ellison, Mark S. Gilthorpe","Background: In longitudinal data, it is common to create 'change scores' by
subtracting measurements taken at baseline from those taken at follow-up, and
then to analyse the resulting 'change' as the outcome variable. In
observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal effect
estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple
simulations to provide an accessible explanation of why change scores do not
estimate causal effects in observational data.
  Methods: Data were simulated to match three general scenarios where the
variable representing measurements of the outcome at baseline was a 1)
competing exposure, 2) confounder, or 3) mediator for the total causal effect
of the exposure on the variable representing measurements of the outcome at
follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses
and DAG-informed analyses.
  Results: Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal effect
estimates unless the variable representing measurements of the outcome at
baseline is a competing exposure, as in a randomised experiment. Where such
variables (i.e. baseline measurements of the outcome) are confounders or
mediators, the conclusions drawn from analyses of change scores diverge
(potentially substantially) from those of DAG-informed analyses.
  Conclusions: Future observational studies that seek causal effect estimates
should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical
strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02764v1

Compound Sequential Change-point Detection in Parallel Data Streams,2019-09-12T18:48:21Z,"Yunxiao Chen, Xiaoou Li","We consider sequential change-point detection in parallel data streams, where
each stream has its own change point. Once a change is detected in a data

normal operation of the pre-change streams, while controlling the proportion of
post-change streams among the active streams at all time points. Taking a
Bayesian formulation, we develop a compound decision framework for this
problem. A procedure is proposed that is uniformly optimal among all sequential
procedures which control the expected proportion of postchange streams at all
time points. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the proposed method

Quantifying the Trendiness of Trends,2019-12-26T12:05:03Z,"Andreas Kryger Jensen, Claus Thorn Ekstr√∏m","News media often report that the trend of some public health outcome has

national level.
  We propose two measures for quantifying the trendiness of trends. Assuming
that reality evolves in continuous time we define what constitutes a trend and
a change in trend, and introduce a probabilistic Trend Direction Index. This
index has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic
has changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We

relaxation model which can be applied to an arbitrary parametric or
nonparametric microsimulation model. The relaxation model modifies car
following dynamics after a lane change, when vehicles can be far from
equilibrium. Relaxation prevents car following models from reacting too
strongly to the changes in space headway caused by lane changing, leading to
more accurate and realistic simulated trajectories. We also show that

Phase-Change Control of Interlayer Exchange Coupling,2019-07-25T01:15:54Z,"Xiaofei Fan, Guodong Wei, Xiaoyang Lin, Xinhe Wang, Zhizhong Si, Xueying Zhang, Qiming Shao, Stephane Mangin, Eric Fullerton, Lei Jiang, Weisheng Zhao","Changing the interlayer exchange coupling between magnetic layers in-situ is
a key issue of spintronics, as it allows for the optimization of properties
that are desirable for applications, including magnetic sensing and memory. In
this paper, we utilize the phase change material VO2 as a spacer layer to
regulate the interlayer exchange coupling between ferromagnetic layers with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The successful growth of ultra-thin (several
nanometres) VO2 films is realized by sputtering at room temperature, which
further enables the fabrication of [Pt/Co]2/VO2/[Co/Pt]2 multilayers with
distinct interfaces. Such a magnetic multilayer exhibits an evolution from
antiferromagnetic coupling to ferromagnetic coupling as the VO2 undergoes a
phase change. The underlying mechanism originates from the change in the
electronic structure of the spacer layer from an insulating to a metallic
state. As a demonstration of phase change spintronics, this work may reveal the
great potential of material innovations for next-generation spintronics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10784v2

"An Approach and Benchmark to Detect Behavioral Changes of Commits in
  Continuous Integration",2019-02-22T13:19:36Z,"Benjamin Danglot, Martin Monperrus, Walter Rudametkin, Benoit Baudry","When a developer pushes a change to an application's codebase, a good
practice is to have a test case specifying this behavioral change. Thanks to
continuous integration (CI), the test is run on subsequent commits to check
that they do no introduce a regression for that behavior. In this paper, we
propose an approach that detects behavioral changes in commits. As input, it
takes a program, its test suite, and a commit. Its output is a set of test
methods that capture the behavioral difference between the pre-commit and
post-commit versions of the program. We call our approach DCI (Detecting
behavioral changes in CI). It works by generating variations of the existing
test cases through (i) assertion amplification and (ii) a search-based
exploration of the input space. We evaluate our approach on a curated set of 60
commits from 6 open source Java projects. To our knowledge, this is the first
ever curated dataset of real-world behavioral changes. Our evaluation shows
that DCI is able to generate test methods that detect behavioral changes. Our
approach is fully automated and can be integrated into current development
processes. The main limitations are that it targets unit tests and works on a
relatively small fraction of commits. More specifically, DCI works on commits
that have a unit test that already executes the modified code. In practice,
from our benchmark projects, we found 15.29% of commits to meet the conditions
required by DCI.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08482v3
"Change point localization in dependent dynamic nonparametric random dot
  product graphs",2019-11-18T09:18:02Z,"Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla, Yi Yu, Carey E. Priebe","In this paper, we study the offline change point localization problem in a
sequence of dependent nonparametric random dot product graphs. To be specific,
assume that at every time point, a network is generated from a nonparametric
random dot product graph model \citep[see e.g.][]{athreya2017statistical},
where the latent positions are generated from unknown underlying distributions.
The underlying distributions are piecewise constant in time and change at
unknown locations, called change points. Most importantly, we allow for
dependence among networks generated between two consecutive change points. This
setting incorporates edge-dependence within networks and temporal dependence
between networks, which is the most flexible setting in the published
literature.
  To accomplish the task of consistently localizing change points, we propose a
novel change point detection algorithm, consisting of two steps. First, we
estimate the latent positions of the random dot product model, our theoretical
result being a refined version of the state-of-the-art results, allowing the
dimension of the latent positions to diverge. Subsequently, we construct a
nonparametric version of the CUSUM statistic \citep[e.g.][]{Page1954,
padilla2019optimal} that allows for temporal dependence. Consistent
localization is proved theoretically and supported by extensive numerical
experiments, which illustrate state-of-the-art performance. We also provide in
depth discussion of possible extensions to give more understanding and
insights.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07494v3
Towards Predicting the Impact of Software Changes on Building Activities,2019-01-22T01:35:30Z,"Michele Tufano, Hitesh Sajnani, Kim Herzig","The pervasive adoption of Continuous Integration practices -- both in
industry and open source projects -- has led software building to become a
daily activity for thousands of developers around the world. Companies such as
Microsoft have invested in in-house infrastructures with the goal of optimizing
the build process. CloudBuild, a distributed and caching build service
developed internally by Microsoft, runs the build process in parallel in the
cloud and relies on caching to accelerate builds. This allows for agile
development and rapid delivery of software even several times a day. However,
moving towards faster builds requires not only improvements on the
infrastructure side, but also attention to developers' changes in the software.
Surely, architectural decisions and software changes, such as addition of
dependencies, can lead to significant build time increase. Yet, estimating the
impact of such changes on build time can be challenging when dealing with
complex, distributed, and cached build systems. In this paper, we envision a
predictive model able to preemptively alert developers on the extent to which
their software changes may impact future building activities. In particular, we
describe an approach that analyzes the developer's change and predicts (i)
whether it impacts (any of) the Longest Critical Path; (ii) may lead to build
time increase and its delta; and (iii) the percentage of future builds that
might be affected by such change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07142v2
Multiple criteria decision-making for lane-change model,2019-10-22T17:58:39Z,"Ao Li, Liting Sun, Wei Zhan, Masayoshi Tomizuka","Simulation has long been an essential part of testing autonomous driving
systems, but only recently has simulation been useful for building and training
self-driving vehicles. Vehicle behavioural models are necessary to simulate the
interactions between robot cars. This paper proposed a new method to formalize
the lane-changing model in urban driving scenarios. We define human incentives
from different perspectives, speed incentive, route change incentive, comfort
incentive and courtesy incentive etc. We applied a decision-theoretical tool,
called Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to take these incentive policies
into account. The strategy of combination is according to different driving
style which varies for each driving. Thus a lane-changing decision selection
algorithm is proposed. Not only our method allows for varying the motivation of
lane-changing from the purely egoistic desire to a more courtesy concern, but
also they can mimic drivers' state, inattentive or concentrate, which
influences their driving Behaviour. We define some cost functions and calibrate
the parameters with different scenarios of traffic data. Distinguishing driving
styles are used to aggregate decision-makers' assessments about various
criteria weightings to obtain the action drivers desire most. Our result
demonstrates the proposed method can produce varied lane-changing behaviour.
Unlike other lane-changing models based on artificial intelligence methods, our
model has more flexible controllability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10142v1

factors. Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a
central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of NLP
tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search in historical texts.
Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address
this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations of
semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich
metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual
information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is
particularly critical in the case of ancient languages, where lack of data and
long diachronic span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between
polysemy (the fact that a word has several senses) and semantic change (the
process of acquiring, losing, or changing senses), and current systems perform
poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model
that leverages categorical metadata about the texts' genre to boost inference
and uncover the evolution of meanings in Ancient Greek corpora. In a new

the reviewers. In a code review process, usually, several iterations take place
where an author submits code changes and a reviewer gives feedback until is
happy to accept the change. In around 12% cases, the changes are abandoned,
eventually wasting all the efforts. In this research, our objective is to
design a tool that can predict whether a code change would be merged or
abandoned at an early stage to reduce the waste of efforts of all stakeholders

real-world demand for such a tool was formally identified by a study by Fan et

We consider a total of 25 features in each code change during the training and
testing of the models. The best performing model named PredCR (Predicting Code
Review), a LightGBM-based classifier achieves around 85% AUC score on average
and relatively improves the state-of-the-art [1] by 14-23%. In our empirical
study on the 146,612 code changes from the three software projects, we find
that (1) The new features like reviewer dimensions that are introduced in
PredCR are the most informative. (2) Compared to the baseline, PredCR is more
effective towards reducing bias against new developers. (3) PredCR uses
historical data in the code review repository and as such the performance of

water. Flux and/or polarization measurements of starlight that is reflected by
exoplanets could help to identify exo-oceans. We investigate which broadband
spectral features in flux and polarization phase functions of reflected
starlight uniquely identify exo-oceans. We compute total fluxes F and polarized
fluxes Q of starlight reflected by cloud-free and (partly) cloudy exoplanets,
for wavelengths from 350 to 865 nm. The ocean surface has waves composed of
Fresnel reflecting wave facets and whitecaps, and scattering within the water
body is included. Total flux F, polarized flux Q, and degree of polarization P
of ocean planets change color from blue, through white, to red at phase angles
alpha ranging from 134-108 deg for F, and from 123-157 deg for Q, with cloud
coverage fraction fc increasing from 0.0 to 1.0 for F, and to 0.98 for Q. The
color change in P only occurs for fc ranging from 0.03-0.98, with the color
crossing angle alpha ranging from 88-161 deg. The total flux F of a cloudy,
zero surface albedo planet can also change color, and for fc=0.0, an ocean
planet's F will not change color for surface pressures ps > 8 bars. Polarized
flux Q of a zero surface albedo planet does not change color for any fc. The
color change of P of starlight reflected by an exoplanet, from blue, through
white, to red with increasing alpha above 88 deg, appears to identify a
(partly) cloudy exo-ocean. The color change of polarized flux Q with increasing
alpha above 123 deg appears to uniquely identify an exo-ocean, independent of
surface pressure or cloud fraction. At the color changing phase angle, the
angular distance between a star and its planet is much larger than at the phase

estimation can be performed automatically, in just one single step without
going through any hypothesis tests for non-identifiable models, or unwieldy
classical a-posterior methods, it becomes an interesting, but also challenging
idea. In this paper we introduce the estimation method based on the quantile
LASSO approach. Unlike standard LASSO approaches, our method does not rely on
typical assumptions usually required for the model errors, such as sub-Gaussian
or Normal distribution. The proposed quantile LASSO method can effectively
handle heavy-tailed random error distributions, and, in general, it offers a
more complex view of the data as one can obtain any conditional quantile of the
target distribution, not just the conditional mean. It is proved that under
some reasonable assumptions the number of change-points is not underestimated
with probability tenting to one, and, in addition, when the number of
change-points is estimated correctly, the change-point estimates provided by
the quantile LASSO are consistent. Numerical simulations are used to
demonstrate these results and to illustrate the empirical performance robust

by finely-tuned In doping. Our results moreover show the existence of a
critical doping concentration around $x = 0.12$ in Ge$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te, where
various properties take either an extremum or change their characters: The
structure changes from polarly-rhombohedral to cubic, the resistivity sharply
increases by orders of magnitude, the type of charge carriers changes from
holes to electrons, and the density of states diminishes at the dawn of an
emerging superconducting phase. By core-level photoemission spectroscopy we
find indications of a change in the In-valence state from In$^{3+}$ to
In$^{1+}$ with increasing $x$, suggesting that this system is a new promising
playground to probe valence fluctuations and their possible impact on
superconductivity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08739v1

"On the Coordinate Change to the First-Order Spline Kernel for
  Regularized Impulse Response Estimation",2019-01-30T14:08:40Z,"Yusuke Fujimoto, Tianchi Chen","The so-called tuned-correlated kernel (sometimes also called the first-order
stable spline kernel) is one of the most widely used kernels for the
regularized impulse response estimation. This kernel can be derived by applying
an exponential decay function as a coordinate change to the first-order spline
kernel. This paper focuses on this coordinate change and derives new kernels by
investigating other coordinate changes induced by stable and strictly proper
transfer functions. It is shown that the corresponding kernels inherit
properties from these coordinate changes and the first-order spline kernel. In
particular, they have the maximum entropy property and moreover, the inverse of
their Gram matrices has sparse structure. In addition, the spectral analysis of
some special kernels are provided. Finally, a numerical example is given to

principles behind next-paradigm, high-productivity programming languages, and
how will they change everyday program development? Based on my decade-plus
experience of heavy-duty development in declarative languages, I speculate that
certain tenets of high-productivity languages are inevitable. These include,

"Interactive Trajectory Adaptation through Force-guided Bayesian
  Optimization",2019-08-20T10:28:51Z,Leonel Rozo,"Flexible manufacturing processes demand robots to easily adapt to changes in
the environment and interact with humans. In such dynamic scenarios, robotic
tasks may be programmed through learning-from-demonstration approaches, where a
nominal plan of the task is learned by the robot. However, the learned plan may
need to be adapted in order to fulfill additional requirements or overcome
unexpected environment changes. When the required adaptation occurs at the
end-effector trajectory level, a human operator may want to intuitively show
the robot the desired changes by physically interacting with it. In this
scenario, the robot needs to understand the human intended changes from noisy
haptic data, quickly adapt accordingly and execute the nominal task plan when
no further adaptation is needed. This paper addresses the aforementioned
challenges by leveraging LfD and Bayesian optimization to endow the robot with
data-efficient adaptation capabilities. Our approach exploits the sensed
interaction forces to guide the robot adaptation, and speeds up the
optimization process by defining local search spaces extracted from the learned
task model. We show how our framework quickly adapts the learned
spatial-temporal patterns of the task, leading to deformed trajectory
distributions that are consistent with the nominal plan and the changes
introduced by the human.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07263v1
RelGAN: Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation via Relative Attributes,2019-08-20T10:54:34Z,"Po-Wei Wu, Yu-Jing Lin, Che-Han Chang, Edward Y. Chang, Shih-Wei Liao","Multi-domain image-to-image translation has gained increasing attention
recently. Previous methods take an image and some target attributes as inputs
and generate an output image with the desired attributes. However, such methods
have two limitations. First, these methods assume binary-valued attributes and
thus cannot yield satisfactory results for fine-grained control. Second, these
methods require specifying the entire set of target attributes, even if most of
the attributes would not be changed. To address these limitations, we propose
RelGAN, a new method for multi-domain image-to-image translation. The key idea
is to use relative attributes, which describes the desired change on selected
attributes. Our method is capable of modifying images by changing particular
attributes of interest in a continuous manner while preserving the other

Do Energy-oriented Changes Hinder Maintainability?,2019-08-22T12:21:08Z,"Luis Cruz, Rui Abreu, John Grundy, Li Li, Xin Xia","Energy efficiency is a crucial quality requirement for mobile applications.

commits, we measure maintainability -- as computed by the Software Improvement
Group's web-based source code analysis service Better Code Hub (BCH) -- before

improving energy efficiency comes with a significant decrease in
maintainability. This is particularly evident in code changes to accommodate
the Power Save Mode and Wakelock Addition energy patterns. In addition, we
perform manual analysis to assess how real examples of energy-oriented changes
affect maintainability. Our results help mobile app developers to 1) avoid

identically distributed (i.p.i.d.) processes is defined to capture periodically
varying statistical behavior. A novel Bayesian theory is developed for
detecting a change in the distribution of an i.p.i.d. process. It is shown that
the Bayesian change point problem can be expressed as a problem of optimal
control of a Markov decision process (MDP) with periodic transition and cost
structures. Optimal control theory is developed for periodic MDPs for
discounted and undiscounted total cost criteria. A fixed-point equation is
obtained that is satisfied by the optimal cost function. It is shown that the
optimal policy for the MDP is nonstationary but periodic in nature. A value
iteration algorithm is obtained to compute the optimal cost function. The
results from the MDP theory are then applied to detect changes in i.p.i.d.

Nonradiative to Superscattering Switch with Phase-Change Materials,2019-04-25T16:37:56Z,"Sergey Lepeshov, Alex Krasnok, Andrea Al√π","Phase-change materials (PCMs) can switch between different crystalline states

since the phase transition requires strong pump fields. Here, we explore hybrid
metal-semiconductor core-shell nanoantennas loaded with PCMs, enabling a
drastic switch in scattering features as the load changes its phase. Large
scattering, beyond the limits of small resonant particles, is achieved by
spectrally matching different Mie resonances, while scattering cancellation and
cloaking is achieved with out-of-phase electric dipole oscillations in the PCM
shell and Ag core. We show that tuning the PCM crystallinity we can largely
vary total (~15 times) and forward (~100 times) scattering. Remarkably, a

sufficiently often. Therefore the embeddability strength of a c.e. degree has
much to do with the degree's mind change frequency. Nonlowness is another
common measure of degree strength, with nonlow degrees expected to compute more
degrees than low ones. We ask if nonlowness and frequent mind changes are
independent measures of strength. Downey and Greenberg (2015) claimed this to
be true without proof, so we present one here. We prove the claim by building

A Conditional Perspective for Iterated Belief Contraction,2019-11-20T11:23:17Z,"Kai Sauerwald, Gabriele Kern-Isberner, Christoph Beierle","According to Boutillier, Darwiche, Pearl and others, principles for iterated
revision can be characterised in terms of changing beliefs about conditionals.
For iterated contraction a similar formulation is not known. This is especially
because for iterated belief change the connection between revision and
contraction via the Levi and Harper identity is not straightforward, and
therefore, characterisation results do not transfer easily between iterated
revision and contraction. In this article, we develop an axiomatisation of
iterated contraction in terms of changing conditional beliefs. We prove that

"On the length scale dependence of DNA conformational change under local
  perturbation",2019-11-12T07:40:23Z,"Soumyadip Banerjee, Kushal Shah, Shaunak Sen","Conformational change of a DNA molecule is frequently observed in multiple
biological processes and has been modelled using a chain of strongly coupled
oscillators with a nonlinear bistable potential. While the mechanism and
properties of conformational change in the model have been investigated and
several reduced order models developed, the conformational dynamics as a
function of the length of the oscillator chain is relatively less clear. To
address this, we used a modified Lindstedt-Poincare method and numerical
computations. We calculate a perturbation expansion of the frequency of the
model's nonzero modes, finding that approximating these modes with their
unperturbed dynamics, as in a previous reduced order model, may not hold when
the length of the DNA model increases. We investigate the conformational change
to local perturbation in models of varying lengths, finding that for chosen
input and parameters, there are two regions of DNA length in the model, first
where the minimum energy required to undergo the conformational change
increases with DNA length; and second, where it is almost independent of the
length of the DNA model. We analyze the conformational change in these models
by adding randomness to the local perturbation, finding that the tendency of
the system to remain in a stable conformation against random perturbation
decreases with an increase in the DNA length. These results should help to
understand the role of the length of a DNA molecule in influencing its
conformational dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04711v2
Localizing Changes in High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Processes,2019-09-12T15:07:32Z,"Daren Wang, Yi Yu, Alessandro Rinaldo, Rebecca Willett","Autoregressive models capture stochastic processes in which past realizations
determine the generative distribution of new data; they arise naturally in a
variety of industrial, biomedical, and financial settings. A key challenge when
working with such data is to determine when the underlying generative model has
changed, as this can offer insights into distinct operating regimes of the
underlying system. This paper describes a novel dynamic programming approach to
localizing changes in high-dimensional autoregressive processes and associated
error rates that improve upon the prior state of the art. When the model
parameters are piecewise constant over time and the corresponding process is
piecewise stable, the proposed dynamic programming algorithm consistently
localizes change points even as the dimensionality, the sparsity of the
coefficient matrices, the temporal spacing between two consecutive change
points, and the magnitude of the difference of two consecutive coefficient
matrices are allowed to vary with the sample size. Furthermore, the accuracy of
initial, coarse change point localization estimates can be boosted via a
computationally-efficient refinement algorithm that provably improves the
localization error rate. Finally, a comprehensive simulation experiments and a
real data analysis are provided to show the numerical superiority of our
proposed methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06359v2

Importantly we work under the setup where the jump size may be near the

the location of the change point. A secondary near optimal estimate is proposed
which is required for the implementation of the optimal projected least squares
estimate. The prestep estimation procedure is designed to also agnostically
detect the case where no change point exists, thereby removing the need to
pretest for the existence of a change point for the implementation of the
inference methodology. Our results are presented under a general positive

Online Semi-Supervised Concept Drift Detection with Density Estimation,2019-09-25T01:47:28Z,"Chang How Tan, Vincent CS Lee, Mahsa Salehi","Concept drift is formally defined as the change in joint distribution of a
set of input variables X and a target variable y. The two types of drift that
are extensively studied are real drift and virtual drift where the former is
the change in posterior probabilities p(y|X) while the latter is the change in
distribution of X without affecting the posterior probabilities. Many
approaches on concept drift detection either assume full availability of data
labels, y or handle only the virtual drift. In a streaming environment, the
assumption of full availability of data labels, y is questioned. On the other
hand, approaches that deal with virtual drift failed to address real drift.
Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a
semi-supervised framework to deal with the challenges above. The objective of
the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data
labels, y and detect real drift concurrently. This paper proposes a novel
concept drift detection method utilizing the densities of posterior
probabilities in partially labeled streaming environments. Experimental results

A new PIR-based method for real-time tracking,2019-01-30T07:59:16Z,"Tianye Yang, Xuefeng Liu, Shaojie Tang, Jianwei Niu, Peng Guo","Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are considered to be promising devices
for device-free localization due to its advantages of low cost, less intrusive,
and the immunity from multi-path fading. However, most of the existing
PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR
sensors and therefore require a large number of PIR sensors and a careful
deployment. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's
location using machine learning approaches. However, these approaches require
to collect abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this
paper, we propose a PIR-based device-free localization approach based on the
raw data of PIR sensors. The key of this approach is to extract a new type of
location information called as the azimuth change. The extraction of the
azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no
abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental
change. Through experiments, we demonstrated that a device-free localization

the information of the azimuth change can be easily integrated with other

vicinity of dams and in the area of up to 480 km upstream from dams, and time
series of simulated NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Global Reanalysis precipitation

changes in scaling that are different for recordings from upstream and from
downstream (from dams) areas. We found that damming caused appearance of
human-made or enhancement of natural cycles in the small time scales region,
which largely influenced the change in temporal scaling in downstream recording
stations. We additionally found disappearance or decline in the amplitude of
large-time-scale cycles as a result of damming, that changed the dynamics of

non-stationary solution to the dynamic equation ""future price tends to the

presented. In our previous work[2], we established that it is the share
execution flow ($I=dV/dt$) and not the share trading volume ($V$) that is the
driving force of the market, and that asset prices are much more sensitive to
the execution flow $I$ (the dynamic impact) than to the traded volume $V$ (the
regular impact). In this paper, an important advancement is achieved: we define
the ""scalp-price"" ${\cal P}$ as the sum of only those price moves that are
relevant to market dynamics; the criterion of relevance is a high $I$. Thus,
only ""follow the market"" (and not ""little bounce"") events are included in

"ATOM: Commit Message Generation Based on Abstract Syntax Tree and Hybrid

repairs) in natural language, and are useful for program comprehension. Due to
the frequent updates of software and time cost, developers are generally
unmotivated to write commit messages for code changes. Therefore, automating
the message writing process is necessitated. Previous studies on commit message
generation have been benefited from generation models or retrieval models, but
the code structure of changed code, i.e., AST, which can be important for
capturing code semantics, has not been explicitly involved. Moreover, although
generation models have the advantages of synthesizing commit messages for new
code changes, they are not easy to bridge the semantic gap between code and
natural languages which could be mitigated by retrieval models. In this paper,
we propose a novel commit message generation model, named ATOM, which
explicitly incorporates the abstract syntax tree for representing code changes
and integrates both retrieved and generated messages through hybrid ranking.
Specifically, the hybrid ranking module can prioritize the most accurate
message from both retrieved and generated messages regarding one code change.

Long Secondary Periods in luminous red giant variables,2019-12-21T10:55:03Z,"Masaki Takayama, Yoshifusa Ita","The origin of long secondary periods (LSPs) in red giant variables is
unknown. We investigate whether stellar pulsations in red giants can explain
the properties of the LSP variability. VIJHKs light curves obtained by OGLE and
the IRSF/SIRIUS survey in the Small Magellanic Cloud are examined. The sample
of oxygen-rich LSP stars show evidence of a phase lag between the light curves
of optical and near- IR band. The change in radius contributes the bolometric
change roughly half as much as the change in temperature, implying that the
change in effective temperature plays an important role in the luminosity
change associated with the LSPs. We have created numerical models based on the
spherical harmonics to calculate the light amplitudes of dipole mode
variability and have found that the models can roughly reproduce the amplitude
- amplitude relations (e.g. ($\Delta I$, $\Delta H$)). The LSP variability can
be reproduced by the dipole mode oscillations with temperature amplitude of
$\lesssim$ 100 K and $\lesssim$ 150 K for oxygen-rich stars and most carbon
stars, respectively. Radial pulsation models are also examined and can
reproduce the observed colour change of the LSPs. However, there is still an
inconsistency in length between the LSP and periods of radial fundamental mode.
On the other hand, theoretical PL relations of the dipole mode corresponding to
so-called oscillatory convective mode were roughly consistent with observation.
Hence our result suggests that the observations can be consistent with stellar
pulsations corresponding to oscillatory convective modes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10244v1
"Impact of requirements volatility on software architecture: How do
  software teams keep up with ever-changing requirements?",2019-04-17T10:19:02Z,"Sandun Dasanayake, Sanja Aaramaa, Jouni Markkula, Markku Oivo","Requirements volatility is a major issue in software development, causing
problems such as higher defect density, project delays and cost overruns.
Software architecture that guides the overall vision of software product, is
one of the areas that is greatly affected by requirements volatility. Since
critical architecture decisions are made based on the requirements at hand,
changes in requirements can result signifiant changes in architecture. With the
wide adoption of agile software development, software architectures are
designed to accommodate possible future changes. However, the changes has to be
carefully managed as unnecessary and excessive changes can bring negative
consequences. An exploratory case study was conducted to study the impact of
requirements volatility on software architecture. Fifteen semi-structured,
thematic interviews were conducted in a European software company. The research
revealed poor communication, information distortion, and external dependencies
as the main factors that cause requirement volatility and inadequate
architecture documentation, inability to trace design rationale, and increased
complexity as the main implications of requirements volatility on software
architecture. Insights from software teams' awareness of the requirement
volatility, factors contribute to it, and possible ways to mitigate its
implications will be utilized to improve the management of requirement
volatility during software architecting process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08164v1
Probing the top quark flavor-changing couplings at CEPC,2019-06-11T13:22:50Z,"Liaoshan Shi, Cen Zhang","We propose to study the flavor properties of the top quark at the future
Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) in China. We systematically consider
the full set of 56 real parameters that characterize the flavor-changing
neutral interactions of the top quark, which can be tested at CEPC in the
single top production channel. Compared with the current bounds from the LEP2
data and the projected limits at the high-luminosity LHC, we find that CEPC
could improve the limits of the four-fermion flavor-changing coefficients by
one to two orders of magnitude, and would also provide similar sensitivity for
the two-fermion flavor-changing coefficients. Overall, CEPC could explore a
large fraction of currently allowed parameter space that will not be covered by
the LHC upgrade. We show that the $c$-jet tagging capacity at CEPC could
further improve its sensitivity to top-charm flavor-changing couplings. If a
signal is observed, the kinematic distribution as well as the $c$-jet tagging
could be exploited to pinpoint the various flavor-changing couplings, providing
valuable information about the flavor properties of the top quark.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04573v3
An Integrated Image Filter for Enhancing Change Detection Results,2019-07-02T11:32:35Z,"Dawei Li, Siyuan Yan, Xin Cai, Yan Cao, Sifan Wang","Change detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. Despite
significant advances have been made, most of the change detection methods fail
to work well in challenging scenes due to ubiquitous noise and interferences.
Nowadays, post-processing methods (e.g. MRF, and CRF) aiming to enhance the
binary change detection results still fall short of the requirements on
universality for distinctive scenes, applicability for different types of
detection methods, accuracy, and real-time performance. Inspired by the nature
of image filtering, which separates noise from pixel observations and recovers
the real structure of patches, we consider utilizing image filters to enhance
the detection masks. In this paper, we present an integrated filter which
comprises a weighted local guided image filter and a weighted spatiotemporal
tree filter. The spatiotemporal tree filter leverages the global spatiotemporal
information of adjacent video frames and meanwhile the guided filter carries
out local window filtering of pixels, for enhancing the coarse change detection
masks. The main contributions are three: (i) the proposed filter can make full
use of the information of the same object in consecutive frames to improve its
current detection mask by computations on a spatiotemporal minimum spanning
tree; (ii) the integrated filter possesses both advantages of local filtering
and global filtering; it not only has good edge-preserving property but also
can handle heavily textured and colorful foreground regions; and (iii) Unlike
some popular enhancement methods (MRF, and CRF) that require either a priori
background probabilities or a posteriori foreground probabilities for every
pixel to improve the coarse detection masks, our method is a versatile
enhancement filter that can be applied after many different types of change
detection methods, and is particularly suitable for video sequences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01301v1

Optimal Estimation of Change in a Population of Parameters,2019-11-28T07:43:03Z,"Ramya Korlakai Vinayak, Weihao Kong, Sham M. Kakade","Paired estimation of change in parameters of interest over a population plays
a central role in several application domains including those in the social
sciences, epidemiology, medicine and biology. In these domains, the size of the
population under study is often very large, however, the number of observations
available per individual in the population is very small (\emph{sparse
observations}) which makes the problem challenging. Consider the setting with
$N$ independent individuals, each with unknown parameters $(p_i, q_i)$ drawn
from some unknown distribution on $[0, 1]^2$. We observe $X_i \sim
\text{Bin}(t, p_i)$ before an event and $Y_i \sim \text{Bin}(t, q_i)$ after the
event. Provided these paired observations, $\{(X_i, Y_i) \}_{i=1}^N$, our goal
is to accurately estimate the \emph{distribution of the change in parameters},
$\delta_i := q_i - p_i$, over the population and properties of interest like
the \emph{$\ell_1$-magnitude of the change} with sparse observations ($t\ll
N$). We provide \emph{information theoretic lower bounds} on the error in
estimating the distribution of change and the $\ell_1$-magnitude of change.
Furthermore, we show that the following two step procedure achieves the optimal
error bounds: first, estimate the full joint distribution of the paired
parameters using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and then estimate the
distribution of change and the $\ell_1$-magnitude of change using the joint
MLE. Notably, and perhaps surprisingly, these error bounds are of the same
order as the minimax optimal error bounds for learning the \emph{full} joint
distribution itself (in Wasserstein-1 distance); in other words, estimating the
magnitude of the change of parameters over the population is, in a minimax
sense, as difficult as estimating the full joint distribution itself.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12568v1

stable single optical trap in the near-optical resonant regime. An optical trap
with the near-optical resonance condition consists of not only the dipole but
also the radiative forces, while a trap using a far-off resonance dominates
only the dipole force. We estimate a near-optical resonant trap for ultracold
rubidium atoms in the range between -0.373 and -2.23 THz from the resonance.
The time dependence of the trapped atoms indicates some difference of the
stable center-of-mass positions in the near-optical resonant trap, and also
indicates that the differences are caused by the change of the equilibrium
condition of the optical dipole and radiative forces. A stable position depends
only on laser detuning due to the change in the radiative force; however, the
position is ineffective against the change in the laser intensity, which
results in a change in the radiative force.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00258v1
Long Term Trends in Atmospheric Pressure and its Variance,2019-02-04T17:00:02Z,"T. A. Howells, J. I. Katz","We use the Global Historical Climatology Network--daily database to calculate
trends in sea-level atmospheric pressures, their variance and the variance of
their day-to-day differences in nine regions of the world. Changes in pressure
reflect the addition of water vapor to the warming atmosphere and changes in
circulation patterns. Pressure gradients drive fronts and storm systems, and
pressure differences, a meteorological parameter distinct from temperature and
precipitation, are a proxy for storminess. In eight of nine regions the mean
sea level pressure decreased at a rate significant at the $2\sigma$ (95\%
confidence) level if correlations between stations are small, but this nominal
assumption is uncertain. We find lower bounds on the characteristic time scale
of change of the sea level pressure variance and its differences between
consecutive days. Depending on assumptions about the uncertainties of the mean
values of trends averaged over many ($> 1000$ in some regions) stations, these
lower bounds on the time scales of change of the variances range from $\sim
100$ to several thousand years. Trends in the variance of day-to-day pressure
differences are negative and nominally significant in six of nine regions.
Nominally significant trends in the pressure variances themselves are positive

Iterated Belief Base Revision: A Dynamic Epistemic Logic Approach,2019-02-17T00:14:26Z,"Marlo Souza, √Ålvaro Moreira, Renata Vieira","AGM's belief revision is one of the main paradigms in the study of belief

Improving Robustness of Task Oriented Dialog Systems,2019-11-12T21:34:15Z,"Arash Einolghozati, Sonal Gupta, Mrinal Mohit, Rushin Shah","Task oriented language understanding in dialog systems is often modeled using
intents (task of a query) and slots (parameters for that task). Intent
detection and slot tagging are, in turn, modeled using sentence classification
and word tagging techniques respectively. Similar to adversarial attack
problems with computer vision models discussed in existing literature, these
intent-slot tagging models are often over-sensitive to small variations in
input -- predicting different and often incorrect labels when small changes are
made to a query, thus reducing their accuracy and reliability. However,
evaluating a model's robustness to these changes is harder for language since
words are discrete and an automated change (e.g. adding `noise') to a query
sometimes changes the meaning and thus labels of a query. In this paper, we
first describe how to create an adversarial test set to measure the robustness
of these models. Furthermore, we introduce and adapt adversarial training
methods as well as data augmentation using back-translation to mitigate these
issues. Our experiments show that both techniques improve the robustness of the

Field choice problem in persistent homology,2019-11-26T05:45:14Z,"Ippei Obayashi, Michio Yoshiwaki","This paper tackles the problem of coefficient field choice in persistent
homology. When we compute a persistence diagram, we need to select a
coefficient field before computation. We should understand the dependency of
the diagram on the coefficient field to facilitate computation and
interpretation of the diagram. We clarify that the dependency is strongly
related to the torsion of $\mathbb{Z}$ relative homology in the filtration. We
show the sufficient and necessary conditions of the independence of coefficient
field choice. An efficient algorithm is proposed to verify the independence. In
a numerical experiment with the algorithm, a persistence diagram rarely changes
even when the coefficient field changes if we consider a filtration in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. The experiment suggests that, in practical terms, changes in
the field coefficient will not change persistence diagrams when the data are in
$\mathbb{R}^3$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11350v3

The available recent photometric measurements were collected and analysed with
various methods. The period has been found to be constant for certain time
intervals, although increasing in overall, in contrast with the previous
expectations, which suggested the period change to reverse. Superimposed on
overall period change, a formerly unknown periodic behaviour has been found in
the $O-C$ diagram of AU Peg, which cannot be matched to the radial velocity
variations. Since the Cepheid is a member of a binary system, it is probable
that the unusual period change is in connection with the companion's tidal
force. The orbital elements of the binary system involving AU Peg have been
also revised.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01255v1

Estimating change points in nonparametric time series regression models,2019-09-16T13:16:14Z,"Maria Mohr, Leonie Selk","In this paper we consider a regression model that allows for time series
covariates as well as heteroscedasticity with a regression function that is
modelled nonparametrically. We assume that the regression function changes at
some unknown time $\lfloor ns_0\rfloor$, $s_0\in(0,1)$, and our aim is to
estimate the (rescaled) change point $s_0$. The considered estimator is based
on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov functional of the marked empirical process of
residuals. We show consistency of the estimator and prove a rate of convergence
of $O_P(n^{-1})$ which in this case is clearly optimal as there are only $n$
points in the sequence. Additionally we investigate the case of lagged
dependent covariates, that is, autoregression models with a change in the
nonparametric (auto-) regression function and give a consistency result. The
method of proof also allows for different kinds of functionals such that
Cram\'er-von Mises type estimators can be considered similarly. The approach
extends existing literature by allowing nonparametric models, time series data

Stock Prices Prediction using Deep Learning Models,2019-09-25T11:38:25Z,"Jialin Liu, Fei Chao, Yu-Chen Lin, Chih-Min Lin","Financial markets have a vital role in the development of modern society.
They allow the deployment of economic resources. Changes in stock prices
reflect changes in the market. In this study, we focus on predicting stock
prices by deep learning model. This is a challenge task, because there is much
noise and uncertainty in information that is related to stock prices. So this
work uses sparse autoencoders with one-dimension (1-D) residual convolutional
networks which is a deep learning model, to de-noise the data. Long-short term
memory (LSTM) is then used to predict the stock price. The prices, indices and
macroeconomic variables in past are the features used to predict the next day's
price. Experiment results show that 1-D residual convolutional networks can
de-noise data and extract deep features better than a model that combines
wavelet transforms (WT) and stacked autoencoders (SAEs). In addition, we
compare the performances of model with two different forecast targets of stock
price: absolute stock price and price rate of change. The results show that
predicting stock price through price rate of change is better than predicting

"Modeling and Quantifying the Impact of Wind Power Penetration on Power
  System Coherency",2019-01-07T23:07:01Z,"Sayak Mukherjee, Aranya Chakrabortty, Saman Babaei","This paper presents a mathematical analysis of how wind generation impacts
the coherency property of power systems. Coherency arises from time-scale
separation in the dynamics of synchronous generators, where generator states
inside a coherent area synchronize over a fast time-scale due to stronger
coupling, while the areas themselves synchronize over a slower time-scale due
to weaker coupling. This time-scale separation is reflected in the form of a
spectral separation in the weighted Laplacian matrix describing the swing
dynamics of the generators. However, when wind farms with doubly-fed induction
generators (DFIG) are integrated in the system then this Laplacian matrix
changes based on both the level of wind penetration and the location of the
wind farms. The modified Laplacian changes the effective slow eigenspace of the
generators. Depending on penetration level, this change may result in changing
the identities of the coherent areas. We develop a theoretical framework to
quantify this modification, and validate our results with numerical simulations
of the IEEE 68-bus system with one and multiple wind farms. We compare our
model based results on clustering with results using measurement-based
principal component analysis to substantiate our derivations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02098v1

dynamic DNA methylation changes are caused by a combination of active
demethylation and de novo methylation processes which have not been
investigated in integrated models. Here we present a hybrid (hidden) Markov
model to describe the cycle of methylation and demethylation over (short) time

deterministic points (i.e. describing mechanisms that occur only during cell
division) and other events occurring at random time points. We test our model

certain trend in morphological change, a latent variable model can be
regularized such that its latent representation reflects this side information.
In this work, we use the Wasserstein Auto-encoder to model this pathology
continuum, and apply the Hilbert-Schmitt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to
enforce dependency between certain latent features and the provided side
information. We experimentally show that the model can provide disentangled and
interpretable latent representations and also generate a continuum of

interacting via a commensurately sign-changing potential which is attractive at
a short range. The droplet formation is heralded by spontaneous crystallization
into topologically distinct domains. This endows each droplet with an emergent
color charge governing their mutual interactions: attractive for equal colors
and repulsive otherwise. The number of allowed colors is fixed only by the
discrete spatial symmetries of the sign-changing part of the interaction
potential. With increasing interaction range, the droplets become progressively
more mobile, with their color charge still being energetically protected,
allowing for nontrivial viscous dynamics of the interacting droplet plasmas
formed during cooling. Sign-changing potentials with a short-range attraction

promising solution is to continuously accumulate images to maintain an adequate

Derivation of non-classical stochastic price dynamics equations,2019-08-03T01:28:09Z,"Carey Caginalp, Gunduz Caginalp","We analyze the relative price change of assets starting from basic
supply/demand considerations subject to arbitrary motivations. The resulting
stochastic differential equation has coefficients that are functions of supply
and demand. We derive these rigorously. The variance in the relative price
change is then also dependent on the supply and demand, and is closely
connected to the expected return. An important consequence for risk assessment
and options pricing is the implication that variance is highest when the
magnitude of price change is greatest, and lowest near market extrema. This
occurs even if supply and demand are not dependent on price trend. The
stochastic equation differs from the standard equation in mathematical finance
in which the expected return and variance are decoupled. The methodology has
implications for the basic framework for risk assessment, suggesting that
volatility should be measured in the context of regimes of price change. The
model we propose shows how investors are often misled by the apparent calm of
markets near a market peak. Risk assessment methods utilizing volatility can be
improved using this formulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01103v2

the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on an outcome of interest. As
an introduction to causal inference, the discussion starts with the

methods based on selection on observables (assuming a quasi-random treatment
given observed covariates), instrumental variables (inducing a quasi-random
shift in the treatment), difference-in-differences and changes-in-changes
(exploiting changes in outcomes over time), as well as regression
discontinuities and kinks (using changes in the treatment assignment at some
threshold of a running variable). The chapter discusses methods particularly
suited for data with many observations for a flexible (i.e. semi- or
nonparametric) modeling of treatment effects, and/or many (i.e. high
dimensional) observed covariates by applying machine learning to select and
control for covariates in a data-driven way. This is not only useful for

those groups for which the treatment is most effective.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00641v1

weak-supervision step to deal with real concept drift (change in statistical
properties of target). Our density-based clustering avoids problems posed by
the curse of dimensionality to create an evolving 'map' of the live data space,

nervous system builds an internal representation. Examining how subsequent
reaches in unpracticed directions generalize reveals this representation.
Though it is the subject of frequent studies, it is not known how this
representation changes across training directions, or how changes in reach
direction and the corresponding changes in limb impedance, influence
measurements of it. We ran a force field adaptation experiment using eight
groups of subjects each trained on one of eight standard directions and then
tested for generalization in the remaining seven directions. Generalization in
all directions was local and asymmetric, providing limited and unequal transfer
to the left and right side of the trained target. These asymmetries were not
consistent in either magnitude or direction even after correcting for changes
in limb impedance, at odds with previous explanations. Relying on a standard
model for generalization the inferred representations inconsistently shifted to
one side or the other of their respective training direction. A second model
that accounted for limb impedance and variations in baseline trajectories

"Detecting Urban Changes with Recurrent Neural Networks from
  Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Data",2019-10-17T09:15:43Z,"Maria Papadomanolaki, Sagar Verma, Maria Vakalopoulou, Siddharth Gupta, Konstantinos Karantzalos","\begin{abstract} The advent of multitemporal high resolution data, like the
Copernicus Sentinel-2, has enhanced significantly the potential of monitoring
the earth's surface and environmental dynamics. In this paper, we present a
novel deep learning framework for urban change detection which combines
state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks (similar to U-Net) for feature
representation and powerful recurrent networks (such as LSTMs) for temporal
modeling. We report our results on the recently publicly available bi-temporal
Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) Sentinel-2 dataset, enhancing the
temporal information with additional images of the same region on different
dates. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the recurrent networks as well
as the use of the additional dates on the unseen test-set using an ensemble
cross-validation strategy. All the developed models during the validation phase
have scored an overall accuracy of more than 95%, while the use of LSTMs and
further temporal information, boost the F1 rate of the change class by an
additional 1.5%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07778v1
"Learning the piece-wise constant graph structure of a varying Ising

time-varying Ising model that evolves piece-wise constantly. The aim is to
identify both the moments at which significant changes occur in the Ising
model, as well as the underlying graph structures. For this purpose, we propose
to estimate the neighborhood of each node by maximizing a penalized version of
its conditional log-likelihood. The objective of the penalization is twofold:
it imposes sparsity in the learned graphs and, thanks to a fused-type penalty,
it also enforces them to evolve piece-wise constantly. Using few assumptions,
we provide two change-points consistency theorems. Those are the first in the
context of unknown number of change-points detection in time-varying Ising
model. Finally, experimental results on several synthetic datasets and a

Stability of Graph Neural Networks to Relative Perturbations,2019-10-21T21:03:38Z,"Fernando Gama, Joan Bruna, Alejandro Ribeiro","Graph neural networks (GNNs), consisting of a cascade of layers applying a
graph convolution followed by a pointwise nonlinearity, have become a powerful
architecture to process signals supported on graphs. Graph convolutions (and
thus, GNNs), rely heavily on knowledge of the graph for operation. However, in
many practical cases the GSO is not known and needs to be estimated, or might
change from training time to testing time. In this paper, we are set to study
the effect that a change in the underlying graph topology that supports the
signal has on the output of a GNN. We prove that graph convolutions with
integral Lipschitz filters lead to GNNs whose output change is bounded by the
size of the relative change in the topology. Furthermore, we leverage this
result to show that the main reason for the success of GNNs is that they are
stable architectures capable of discriminating features on high eigenvalues,
which is a feat that cannot be achieved by linear graph filters (which are
either stable or discriminative, but cannot be both). Finally, we comment on
the use of this result to train GNNs with increased stability and run

Broad Neural Network for Change Detection in Aerial Images,2019-02-28T22:16:56Z,"Shailesh Shrivastava, Alakh Aggarwal, Pratik Chattopadhyay","A change detection system takes as input two images of a region captured at
two different times, and predicts which pixels in the region have undergone
change over the time period. Since pixel-based analysis can be erroneous due to
noise, illumination difference and other factors, contextual information is
usually used to determine the class of a pixel (changed or not). This
contextual information is taken into account by considering a pixel of the
difference image along with its neighborhood. With the help of ground truth
information, the labeled patterns are generated. Finally, Broad Learning
classifier is used to get prediction about the class of each pixel. Results
show that Broad Learning can classify the data set with a significantly higher
F-Score than that of Multilayer Perceptron. Performance comparison has also

in order to detect possible deviations from this crucial assumption. In this
paper, we model fMRI data as functional time series and develop tools for the
detection of deviations from covariance stationarity via change point
alternatives. We propose a nonparametric procedure which is based on dimension
reduction techniques. However, as the projection of the functional time series
on a finite and rather low-dimensional subspace involves the risk of missing
changes which are orthogonal to the projection space, we also consider two test

to a general framework for change-point detection for data with local

A Bi-Level Cooperative Driving Strategy Allowing Lane Changes,2019-12-24T19:12:21Z,"Huile Xu, Yi Zhang, Christos G. Cassandras, Li Li, Shuo Feng","This paper studies the cooperative driving of connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and
ramping regions). Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane
change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not
appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones),
vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential
collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The
right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the
upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then
resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are
represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by
combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a
very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the
shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving and
passenger comfort). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to
good traffic performance in real-time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11495v1

traffic congestion...). All other edges have stable weights that never change.
This problem can be now considered as a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem on

advance alternative MSTs for all possible configurations. No additional
computation is then needed after any change in the problem because the MSTs are

the phase transition at fixed volume, a relatively unexplored paradigm for

we report evidence of strong anisotropic conduction-f electron mixing (c-f
mixing) in CeBi by observing a largely expanded Ce-5d pocket at low
temperature, with no change in the Bi-6p bands. The Fermi surface (FS)
expansion is accompanied by a pronounced spectral weight transfer from the
local 4f 0 peak of Ce (corresponding to Ce3+) to the itinerant conduction bands
near the Fermi level. Careful analysis suggests that the observed large FS
change (with a volume expansion of the electron pocket up to 40%) can most
naturally be explained by a small valence change (~ 1%) of Ce, which coexists
with a very weak Kondo screening. Our work therefore provides evidence for a FS
change driven by real charge fluctuations deep in the Kondo limit, which is
made possible by the low carrier density.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07402v1

Brownian bridge under the null hypothesis of no parameter change. We conduct
simulations to evaluate performances of the proposed test in the presence of
outliers. Numerical results confirm that the proposed test posses a strong
robust property against outliers. In real data analysis, we fit the

polymer swells after absorbing the analyte and causes the central cantilever to
bend laterally towards one side, causing a change in the measured capacitance.

the changes of the defining relations of the CCR. These defining relations of
the multiplication in the CCR-algebra depend explicitly on the value of the

the original state space (this gives restrictions on the admissible changes of
the Plank's constant) and what properties have original quantum states $\omega$

convex combination of Fock states with different values of Planck's constant.
The second important class of states we study are the KMS-states, here the
rescaling alters in a nontrivial way the relevant dynamics. We also show that

  1950-1990",2019-07-21T06:58:22Z,Melvin Wevers,"Contemporary debates on filter bubbles and polarization in public and social
media raise the question to what extent news media of the past exhibited
biases. This paper specifically examines bias related to gender in six Dutch
national newspapers between 1950 and 1990. We measure bias related to gender by
comparing local changes in word embedding models trained on newspapers with
divergent ideological backgrounds. We demonstrate clear differences in gender
bias and changes within and between newspapers over time. In relation to themes
such as sexuality and leisure, we see the bias moving toward women, whereas,
generally, the bias shifts in the direction of men, despite growing female
employment number and feminist movements. Even though Dutch society became less
stratified ideologically (depillarization), we found an increasing divergence
in gender bias between religious and social-democratic on the one hand and
liberal newspapers on the other. Methodologically, this paper illustrates how
word embeddings can be used to examine historical language change. Future work
will investigate how fine-tuning deep contextualized embedding models, such as

On Learning Meaningful Code Changes via Neural Machine Translation,2019-01-25T22:12:39Z,"Michele Tufano, Jevgenija Pantiuchina, Cody Watson, Gabriele Bavota, Denys Poshyvanyk","Recent years have seen the rise of Deep Learning (DL) techniques applied to
source code. Researchers have exploited DL to automate several development and
maintenance tasks, such as writing commit messages, generating comments and
detecting vulnerabilities among others. One of the long lasting dreams of
applying DL to source code is the possibility to automate non-trivial coding
activities. While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning
how to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the
types of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our
goal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively
investigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn
how to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull
requests. We train and experiment with the NMT model on a set of 236k pairs of
code components before and after the implementation of the changes provided in
the pull requests. We show that, when applied in a narrow enough context (i.e.,
small/medium-sized pairs of methods before/after the pull request changes), NMT
can automatically replicate the changes implemented by developers during pull
requests in up to 36% of the cases. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows
that the model is capable of learning and replicating a wide variety of
meaningful code changes, especially refactorings and bug-fixing activities. Our
results pave the way for novel research in the area of DL on code, such as the
automatic learning and applications of refactoring.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09102v1
"The Effects of the Problem Hamiltonian Parameters on the Minimum
  Spectral Gap in Adiabatic Quantum Optimization",2019-10-07T18:12:11Z,Vicky Choi,"We study the relation between the Ising problem Hamiltonian parameters and
the minimum spectral gap (min-gap) of the system Hamiltonian in the Ising-based
quantum annealer. The main argument we use in this paper to assess the
performance of a QA algorithm is the presence or absence of an anti-crossing
during quantum evolution. For this purpose, we introduce a new parametrization
definition of the anti-crossing. Using the Maximum-weighted Independent Set
(MIS) problem in which there are flexible parameters (energy penalties J
between pairs of edges) in an Ising formulation as the model problem, we
construct examples to show that by changing the value of J, we can change the
quantum evolution from one that has an anti-crossing (that results in an
exponential small min-gap) to one that does not have, or the other way around,
and thus drastically change (increase or decrease) the min-gap. However, we
also show that by changing the value of $J$ alone, one can not avoid the
anti-crossing. We recall a polynomial reduction from an Ising problem to an MIS
problem to show that the flexibility of changing parameters without changing
the problem to be solved can be applied to any Ising problem. As an example, we
show that by such a reduction alone, it is possible to remove the anti-crossing
and thus increase the min-gap. Our anti-crossing definition is necessarily
scaling invariant as scaling the problem Hamiltonian does not change the nature
(i.e. presence or absence) of an anti-crossing. As a side note, we show exactly
how the min-gap is scaled if we scale the problem Hamiltonian by a constant
factor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02985v2

causal discovery. In this paper, we develop a framework for causal discovery
from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from
heterogeneous/NOnstationary Data (CD-NOD), to find causal skeleton and
directions and estimate the properties of mechanism changes. First, we propose
an enhanced constraint-based procedure to detect variables whose local
mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over
observed variables. Second, we present a method to determine causal
orientations by making use of independent changes in the data distribution
implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried by
changing distributions. After learning the causal structure, next, we
investigate how to efficiently estimate the ""driving force"" of the
nonstationarity of a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract from data a
low-dimensional representation of changes. The proposed methods are
nonparametric, with no hard restrictions on data distributions and causal
mechanisms, and do not rely on window segmentation. Furthermore, we find that
data heterogeneity benefits causal structure identification even with
particular types of confounders. Finally, we show the connection between
heterogeneity/nonstationarity and soft intervention in causal discovery.

brightness profiles of the quasar hosts and search for [O III]

Although we do not detect, voorwerpjes surrounding the four quasar host
galaxies, we take advantage of the dim nuclear emission to characterize the
colors and morphologies of the host galaxies. Three of the four galaxies show
morphological evidence of merger activity or tidal features in their residuals.
The three galaxies which are not highly distorted are fit with a single
S\'ersic profile to characterize their overall surface brightness profiles. The
single-S\'ersic fits give intermediate S\'ersic indices between the $n=1$ of

  RANSAC-like approach",2019-12-18T12:46:04Z,Caifa Zhou,"Fingerprinting-based positioning, one of the promising indoor positioning
solutions, has been broadly explored owing to the pervasiveness of sensor-rich
mobile devices, the prosperity of opportunistically measurable
location-relevant signals and the progress of data-driven algorithms. One
critical challenge is to controland improve the quality of the reference
fingerprint map (RFM), which is built at the offline stage and applied for
online positioning. The key concept concerningthe quality control of the RFM is
updating the RFM according to the newly measured data. Though varies methods
have been proposed for adapting the RFM, they approach the problem by
introducing extra-positioning schemes (e.g. PDR orUGV) and directly adjust the
RFM without distinguishing whether critical changes have occurred. This paper
aims at proposing an extra-positioning-free solution by making full use of the
redundancy of measurable features. Loosely inspired by random sampling
consensus (RANSAC), arbitrarily sampled subset of features from the online
measurement are used for generating multi-resamples, which areused for
estimating the intermediate locations. In the way of resampling, it can
mitigate the impact of the changed features on positioning and enables to
retrieve accurate location estimation. The users location is robustly computed
by identifying the candidate locations from these intermediate ones using
modified Jaccardindex (MJI) and the feature-wise change belief is calculated
according to the world model of the RFM and the estimated variability of
features. In order to validate our proposed approach, two levels of
experimental analysis have been carried out. On the simulated dataset, the
average change detection accuracy is about 90%. Meanwhile, the improvement of
positioning accuracy within 2 m is about 20% by dropping out the features that
are detected as changed when performing positioning comparing to that of using

active galactic nuclei (AGN) NGC 3516 that covers 22 years (from 1996 to 2018).
We explore a variability in the broad lines and continuum, finding that the
continuum is changing by more than a factor of 2, while the broad lines are
varying by more than a factor of 10. The minimum of activity is observed in
2014, when the broad lines almost disappeared. We confirm that NGC 3516 is a
changing-look AGN, and the absorption seen in the UV and X-ray may indicate
that there is an obscuring region which is responsible for this.
  The line profiles are also changing. The mean profiles of the broad Halpha
and Hbeta lines show shoulder-like structure in the wings, and enhanced peak,
that may indicate a complex BLR. The rms-profiles of both lines seem to have
the same shape and width of around 4200 km/s, indicating practically the same

This binding leads to the modulation of the local concentrations of the ions of
the background electrolyte (KCl), and, thus, to the modulation of the ionic
current flowing through the pore. The nanopore's wall carries a bipolar charge
pattern with a larger positive buffer region determining the anions as the main
charge carriers and the smaller negative binding region containing binding
sites. This charge pattern proved to be an appropriate one as shown by a
previous comparative study of varying charge patterns (M\'adai et al.\
\textit{J. Mol. Liq.}, 2019, \textbf{283}, 391--398.). Binding of the positive
analyte ions attracts more anions in the pore thus increasing the current. The
asymmetric nature of the pore results in an additional device function,
rectification. Our model, therefore, is a dual response device. Using a reduced
model of the nanopore studied by a hybrid computer simulation method (Local
Equilibrium Monte Carlo coupled to the Nernst-Planck equation) we show that we

A Code Injection Method for Rapid Docker Image Building,2019-11-18T06:04:12Z,"Yujing Wang, Qinyang Bao","Docker images are composed of multiple layers, each of which contains a set
of instructions, and an archive of files. Layers allow Docker to separate a
large build task into smaller ones, such that when a part of the program is
changed, only the corresponding layer needs to be changed. Yet the current
implementation has major inefficiencies that make the rebuilding of an image
unnecessarily slow when changes in bottom layers are required: uneven content
distribution amongst layers, the need to rebuild an entire layer during update,
and the rebuild fall-throughs in many cases. In this paper, we propose a code
injection method that overcomes these inefficiencies by targeting only the
changed layer and then bypassing the layer's content checksum. This process is
developed specifically for an interpreted language such as Python, where
changes can be detected explicitly via text diff tools and run as-is without
compilation. We then demonstrate that this method can accelerate the rebuild
time, effectively reducing the O(n) where n = size of layer rebuild time to
O(1). Whereas for compiled languages, literal code injection cannot guarantee
integrity in compiled machine code. Expanding on the same code injection

"Wind-Induced Changes to Surface Gravity Wave Shape in Deep to
  Intermediate Water",2019-11-18T19:08:23Z,"Thomas Zdyrski, Falk Feddersen","Wave shape (i.e. skewness or asymmetry) plays an important role in beach
morphology evolution, remote sensing, and ship safety. Wind's influence on
ocean waves has been extensively studied theoretically in the context of
growth, but most theories are phase averaged and cannot predict wave shape.
Most laboratory and numerical studies similarly focus on wave growth. A few
laboratory experiments have demonstrated that wind can change wave shape, and
two-phase numerical simulations have also noted wind-induced wave shape
changes. However, wind's effect on wave shape is poorly understood, and no
theory for it exists. For weakly nonlinear waves, wave shape parameters are the
phase of the harmonic relative to the primary frequency (or harmonic phase HP,
zero for a Stokes wave) and relative amplitude of the harmonic to the primary.
Here, surface pressure profiles (denoted Jeffreys, Miles, and Generalized
Miles) are prescribed based on wind-wave generation theories. Theoretical
solutions are derived for quasi-periodic progressive waves and the wind-induced
changes to HP, relative harmonic amplitude, as well as already known phase
speed changes and growth rates. The wave shape parameters depend upon the
chosen surface pressure profile, pressure magnitude and phase relative to the
wave profile, and the nondimensional depth. Wave asymmetry is linked to the
nondimensional growth rate. Atmospheric large eddy simulations constrain
pressure profile parameters. HP predictions are qualitatively consistent with
laboratory observations. This theory, together with the observables of HP and
relative harmonic amplitude, can provide insight into the actual wave surface
pressure profile.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07879v2
"The role of annealing in determining the yielding behavior of glasses
  under cyclic shear deformation",2019-11-29T05:40:33Z,"Himangsu Bhaumik, Giuseppe Foffi, Srikanth Sastry","Yielding behavior in amorphous solids has been investigated in computer
simulations employing uniform and cyclic shear deformation. Recent results
characterise yielding as a discontinuous transition, with the degree of
annealing of glasses being a significant parameter. Under uniform shear,
discontinuous changes in stresses at yielding occur in the high annealing
regime, separated from the poor annealing regime in which yielding is gradual.
In cyclic shear simulations, relatively poorly annealed glasses become
progressively better annealed as the yielding point is approached, with a
relatively modest but clear discontinuous change at yielding. To understand
better the role of annealing on yielding characteristics, we perform athermal
quasistaic cyclic shear simulations of glasses prepared with a wide range of
annealing in two qualitatively different systems -- a model of silica (a
network glass), and an atomic binary mixture glass. Two strikingly different
regimes of behavior emerge: Energies of poorly annealed samples evolve towards
a unique threshold energy as the strain amplitude increases, before yielding
takes place. Well annealed samples, in contrast, show no significant energy
change with strain amplitude till they yield, accompanied by discontinuous
energy changes that increase with the degree of annealing. Significantly, the
threshold energy for both systems correspond to dynamical crossover
temperatures associated with changes in the character of the energy landscape
sampled by glass forming liquids. Uniform shear simulations support the
recently discussed scenario of a random critical point separating ductile and
brittle yielding, which our results now associate with dynamical crossover
temperatures in the corresponding liquids.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12957v1

learning algorithms for unknown Markov decision processes with time-invariant
transition probabilities, but is also able to quickly and correctly identify
the system dynamics following a change. Based on the proposed method, we
generalize the exploration bonuses used in learning for time-invariant Markov
decision processes by introducing a notion of uncertainty in a learned

the modeling of dynamically changing spatial dependencies among roads and
temporal patterns over long input sequences. This paper proposes a novel
spatio-temporal graph attention (ST-GRAT) that effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics in road networks. The novel aspects of our approach
mainly include spatial attention, temporal attention, and spatial sentinel
vectors. The spatial attention takes the graph structure information (e.g.,
distance between roads) and dynamically adjusts spatial correlation based on

changes, and the sentinel vectors allow the model to retrieve new features from
spatially correlated nodes or preserve existing features. The experimental
results show that ST-GRAT outperforms existing models, especially in difficult
conditions where traffic speeds rapidly change (e.g., rush hours). We
additionally provide a qualitative study to analyze when and where ST-GRAT

Unsupervised Image Regression for Heterogeneous Change Detection,2019-09-07T12:26:11Z,"Luigi T. Luppino, Filippo M. Bianchi, Gabriele Moser, Stian N. Anfinsen","Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is an
emerging and challenging topic in remote sensing. In particular, one of the
main challenges is to tackle the problem in an unsupervised manner. In this
paper we propose an unsupervised framework for bitemporal heterogeneous change
detection based on the comparison of affinity matrices and image regression.
First, our method quantifies the similarity of affinity matrices computed from
co-located image patches in the two images. This is done to automatically
identify pixels that are likely to be unchanged. With the identified pixels as
pseudo-training data, we learn a transformation to map the first image to the
domain of the other image, and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected
to carry out the transformation: Gaussian process regression, support vector
regression, random forest regression, and a recently proposed kernel regression
method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate the potentials and
limitations of our framework, and also the benefits and disadvantages of each
regression method, we perform experiments on two real data sets. The results
indicate that the comparison of the affinity matrices can already be considered
a change detection method by itself. However, image regression is shown to
improve the results obtained by the previous step alone and produces accurate
change detection maps despite of the heterogeneity of the multitemporal input
data. Notably, the random forest regression approach excels by achieving
similar accuracy as the other methods, but with a significantly lower
computational cost and with fast and robust tuning of hyperparameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05948v1
Efficient Representation Learning Using Random Walks for Dynamic Graphs,2019-01-05T00:35:43Z,"Hooman Peiro Sajjad, Andrew Docherty, Yuriy Tyshetskiy","An important part of many machine learning workflows on graphs is vertex
representation learning, i.e., learning a low-dimensional vector representation
for each vertex in the graph. Recently, several powerful techniques for
unsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the
state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification
and edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the
graph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural
properties are then encoded in the vector representation space.
  However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to
static graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time.
Static representation learning methods are not able to update the vector
representations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the
vector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of
the extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally
efficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk
based methods to dynamic graphs. The computation complexity of our algorithms
depends upon the extent and rate of changes (the number of edges changed per
update) and on the density of the graph. We empirically evaluate our algorithms
on real world datasets for downstream machine learning tasks of multi-class and
multi-label vertex classification. The results show that our algorithms can
achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods while being
computationally efficient.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01346v2

article demonstrates strain-mediated magnetoelectric write and read operations
simultaneously in Co60Fe20B20/ Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)0.7Ti0.3O3 heterostructures
without using any symmetry breaking magnetic field at room temperature. By
applying an external DC-voltage across a (011)-cut PMN-PT substrate, the
ferroelectric polarization is re-oriented, which results in an anisotropic
in-plane strain that transfers to the CoFeB thin film and changes its magnetic
anisotropy Hk. The change in Hk in-turn results in a 90o rotation of the
magnetic easy axis for sufficiently high voltages. Simultaneously, the inverse
effect is employed to read changes of the magnetic properties. Because the
Piezoelectric (PE)/FerroMagnetic (FM) system is fully coupled, the change of
magnetization in FM induces an elastic stress in the PE layer, which generates
a piezoelectric potential in the system that can be used to readout the
magnetic state of the FM layer. Our experimental results are in excellent
qualitative agreement with a recently proposed, experimentally benchmarked
equivalent circuit model that considers how magnetic properties are
electrically controlled in such ME/PE heterostructure and how a back-voltage is
generated due to changing magnetic properties in a self-consistent model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01368v1

identify key factors regarding security which may lead them to failing to
appropriately change people's behaviour. Past and current efforts to improve
information-security practices and promote a sustainable society have not had
the desired impact. It is important therefore to critically reflect on the
challenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens,
consumers and employees. In particular, our work considers these challenges
from a Psychology perspective, as we believe that understanding how people
perceive risks is critical to creating effective awareness campaigns. Changing
behaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive
behaviours - firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice,
and secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so - and the latter
requires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour
change are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review
the suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear
appeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an
awareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or
failure. Finally, we present examples of existing awareness campaigns in
different cultures (the UK and Africa) and reflect on these.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02672v1

when strained. It has two major contributions: strain induced geometric and
electronic changes. If the geometric factor dominates, like in ordinary metals
such as copper, the elastoresistance is positive and rather small, i.e.
typically of order 1. In a few materials, however, changes in electronic
structure dominate, which gives rise to larger and even negative values, such
as (-11) for Bi. Here, we report that the transition metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC) WTe$_{2}$ is a member of the second group, exhibiting a large and
non-monotonic elastoresistance that is about (-20) near 100 K and changes sign
at low temperatures. We discover that an applied magnetic field has a dramatic
effect on the elastoresistance in WTe$_{2}$: in the quantum regime at low
temperatures, it leads to quantum oscillations of the elastoresistance, that
ranges between (-80) to 120 within a field range of only half a Tesla. In the
semiclassical regime at intermediate temperatures, we find that the
elastoresistance rapidly increases and changes sign in a magnetic field. We
provide a semi-quantitative understanding of our experimental results using a
combination of first-principle and analytical low-energy model calculations.

The threshold age of Keyfitz' entropy,2019-01-23T15:48:35Z,"Jos√© Manuel Aburto, Jes√∫s-Adri√°n Alvarez, Francisco Villavicencio, James W. Vaupel","BACKGROUND Indicators of relative inequality of lifespans are important
because they capture the dimensionless shape of aging. They are markers of
inequality at the population level and express the uncertainty at the time of
death at the individual level. In particular, Keyfitz' entropy $\bar{H}$
represents the elasticity of life expectancy to a change in mortality and it
has been used as an indicator of lifespan variation. However, it is unknown how
this measure changes over time and whether a threshold age exists, as it does
for other lifespan variation indicators.
  RESULTS The time derivative of $\bar{H}$ can be decomposed into changes in
life disparity $e^\dagger$ and life expectancy at birth $e_o$. Likewise,
changes over time in $\bar{H}$ are a weighted average of age-specific rates of
mortality improvements. These weights reflect the sensitivity of $\bar{H}$ and
show how mortality improvements can increase (or decrease) the relative
inequality of lifespans. Further, we prove that $\bar{H}$, as well as
$e^\dagger$, in the case that mortality is reduced in every age, has a
threshold age below which saving lives reduces entropy, whereas improvements
above that age increase entropy.
  CONTRIBUTION We give a formal expression for changes over time of $\bar{H}$
and provide a formal proof of the threshold age that separates reductions and
increases in lifespan inequality from age-specific mortality improvements.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07963v1
A Meta-Transfer Objective for Learning to Disentangle Causal Mechanisms,2019-01-30T15:47:12Z,"Yoshua Bengio, Tristan Deleu, Nasim Rahaman, Rosemary Ke, S√©bastien Lachapelle, Olexa Bilaniuk, Anirudh Goyal, Christopher Pal","We propose to meta-learn causal structures based on how fast a learner adapts
to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to
interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We
show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to
faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are
concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is
modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower
effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting
to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified
distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used
to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The
distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions
(clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these
interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via
continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas
could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed
variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation
out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the
assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these
mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10912v2

  Hyperspectral Image Change Detection",2019-05-05T11:36:53Z,"Qi Wang, Zhenghang Yuan, Qian Du, Xuelong Li","Change detection (CD) is an important application of remote sensing, which
provides timely change information about large-scale Earth surface. With the
emergence of hyperspectral imagery, CD technology has been greatly promoted, as
hyperspectral data with the highspectral resolution are capable of detecting
finer changes than using the traditional multispectral imagery. Nevertheless,
the high dimension of hyperspectral data makes it difficult to implement
traditional CD algorithms. Besides, endmember abundance information at subpixel
level is often not fully utilized. In order to better handle high dimension
problem and explore abundance information, this paper presents a General
End-to-end Two-dimensional CNN (GETNET) framework for hyperspectral image
change detection (HSI-CD). The main contributions of this work are threefold:
1) Mixed-affinity matrix that integrates subpixel representation is introduced
to mine more cross-channel gradient features and fuse multi-source information;
2) 2-D CNN is designed to learn the discriminative features effectively from
multi-source data at a higher level and enhance the generalization ability of
the proposed CD algorithm; 3) A new HSI-CD data set is designed for the
objective comparison of different methods. Experimental results on real

it remains one of the biggest public health threats. As an alternative to
tobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased
dramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking
behavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes
and lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery
device to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative
behavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology
that can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for
initiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking
behavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an
agent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig
use on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the
initiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the
simulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower
prevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for
reducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of
proximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig
user (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding
of drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such
aspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and

Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments,2019-05-10T07:05:27Z,"Sindhu Padakandla, Prabuchandran K. J, Shalabh Bhatnagar","Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn optimal decisions in the presence

non-stationary environments and in these scenarios, RL methods yield
sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we thus consider the problem of
developing RL methods that obtain optimal decisions in a non-stationary
environment. The goal of this problem is to maximize the long-term discounted
reward achieved when the underlying model of the environment changes over time.
To achieve this, we first adapt a change point algorithm to detect change in
the statistics of the environment and then develop an RL algorithm that
maximizes the long-run reward accrued. We illustrate that our change point
method detects change in the model of the environment effectively and thus
facilitates the RL algorithm in maximizing the long-run reward. We further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution on non-stationary random
Markov decision processes, a sensor energy management problem and a traffic

Improving Change Prediction Models with Code Smell-Related Information,2019-05-26T21:44:29Z,"Gemma Catolino, Fabio Palomba, Francesca Arcelli Fontana, Andrea De Lucia, Andy Zaidman, Filomena Ferrucci","Code smells represent sub-optimal implementation choices applied by
developers when evolving software systems. The negative impact of code smells
has been widely investigated in the past: besides developers' productivity and
ability to comprehend source code, researchers empirically showed that the
presence of code smells heavily impacts the change-proneness of the affected
classes. On the basis of these findings, in this paper we conjecture that code
smell-related information can be effectively exploited to improve the
performance of change prediction models, ie models having as goal that of
indicating to developers which classes are more likely to change in the future,
so that they may apply preventive maintenance actions. Specifically, we exploit
the so-called intensity index - a previously defined metric that captures the
severity of a code smell - and evaluate its contribution when added as
additional feature in the context of three state of the art change prediction
models based on product, process, and developer-based features. We also compare
the performance achieved by the proposed model with the one of an alternative
technique that considers the previously defined antipattern metrics, namely a
set of indicators computed considering the history of code smells in files. Our
results report that (i) the prediction performance of the intensity-including
models is statistically better than that of the baselines and (ii) the
intensity is a more powerful metric with respect to the alternative
smell-related ones.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10889v1
Quantum state change in light of changes in valuational entropies,2019-08-08T00:38:37Z,Arkady Bolotin,"In the statement ""The vector is an element of the closed linear subspace of
the Hilbert space H"", the predicate ""... is an element of ..."" might be not
only determined, that is, either true or false (depending on whether set
membership is applicable or inapplicable to the specified vector and subspace)
but also undetermined, that is, neither true nor false. To evaluate the
vagueness of set membership among arbitrary vectors and closed linear subspaces
of H, the notion of the entropy of the predicate ""... is an element of ..."" is
introduced in the present paper. Since each closed linear subspace in H
uniquely represents the atomic proposition P about a quantum system, the
entropy of this predicate can also be considered as the valuational entropy
that measures the uncertainty about the assignment of truth values to the
proposition P. As it is demonstrated in the paper, in the Hilbert space H of
the dimension greater than or equal to 2, there always exists a nonempty set S
of the closed linear subspaces in H, such that the entropy of the predicate
""... is an element of ..."" on the given vector of H and all the subspaces of S
cannot be zero. This implies the existence of two different processes of the
pure quantum state change: the process which yields no changes in the
valuational entropies of the propositions (corresponding to the deterministic
and reversible evolution) and the process which brings forth changes in the
valuational entropies (corresponding to the gain or loss of information in a
quantum measurement).",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02887v1

  dilemmas",2019-08-30T15:55:12Z,"Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc","Varying environmental conditions affect relations between interacting
individuals in social dilemmas, thus affecting also the evolution of
cooperation. Oftentimes these environmental variations are seasonal and can

study how periodic shifts between different manifestations of social dilemmas
affect cooperation. We observe a non-trivial interplay between the inherent
spatiotemporal dynamics that characterizes the spreading of cooperation in a
particular social dilemma type and the frequency of payoff changes. In
particular, we show that periodic changes between two available games with
global ordering best be fast, while periodic changes between global and local
ordering games best be slow for cooperation to thrive. We also show that the
frequency of periodic changes between two local ordering social dilemmas is
irrelevant, because then the process is fast and simply the average cooperation
level of the two is returned. The structure of the interaction network plays an
important role too in that lattices promote local ordering, whilst random
graphs hinder the formation of compact cooperative clusters. Conversely, for
local ordering the regular structure of the interaction network is only
marginally relevant as role-separating checkerboard patterns do not rely on

Evolutionary dimension reduction in phenotypic space,2019-10-03T04:20:06Z,"Takuya U. Sato, Kunihiko Kaneko","In general, cellular phenotypes, as measured by concentrations of cellular
components, involve large degrees of freedom. However, recent measurement has
demonstrated that phenotypic changes resulting from adaptation and evolution in
response to environmental changes are effectively restricted to a
low-dimensional subspace. Thus, uncovering the origin and nature of such a
drastic dimension reduction is crucial to understanding the general
characteristics of biological adaptation and evolution. Herein, we first
formulated the dimension reduction in terms of dynamical systems theory:
considering the steady growth state of cells, the reduction is represented by
the separation of a few large singular values of the inverse Jacobian matrix
around a fixed point. We then examined this dimension reduction by numerical
evolution of cells consisting of thousands of chemicals whose concentrations
determine phenotype. As a result of the evolution, phenotypic changes due to
mutations and external perturbations were found to be mainly restricted to a
one-dimensional subspace. One singular value of the inverse Jacobian matrix at
a fixed point of concentrations was significantly larger than the others. The
major phenotypic changes due to mutations and external perturbations occur
along the corresponding left-singular vector, which leads to phenotypic
constraint, and fitness dominantly changes in the same direction. Once such
phenotypic constraint is acquired, phenotypic evolution to a novel environment
takes advantage of this restricted phenotypic direction. This results in the
convergence of phenotypic pathways across genetically different strains, as is
experimentally observed, while accelerating further evolution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01297v2
"Automating Data Monitoring: Detecting Structural Breaks in Time Series
  Data Using Bayesian Minimum Description Length",2019-10-04T04:03:02Z,"Yingbo Li, Robert Cezeaux, Di Yu","In modern business modeling and analytics, data monitoring plays a critical
role. Nowadays, sophisticated models often rely on hundreds or even thousands
of input variables. Over time, structural changes such as abrupt level shifts
or trend slope changes may occur among some of these variables, likely due to
changes in economy or government policies. As a part of data monitoring, it is
important to identify these changepoints, in terms of which variables exhibit
such changes, and what time locations do the changepoints occur. Being alerted
about the changepoints can help modelers decide if models need modification or
rebuilds, while ignoring them may increase risks of model degrading. Simple
process control rules often flag too many false alarms because regular seasonal
fluctuations or steady upward or downward trends usually trigger alerts. To
reduce potential false alarms, we create a novel statistical method based on
the Bayesian Minimum Description Length (BMDL) framework to perform multiple
change-point detection. Our method is capable of detecting all structural
breaks occurred in the past, and automatically handling data with or without
seasonality and/or autocorrelation. It is implemented with computation
algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and can be applied to all
variables in parallel. As an explainable anomaly detection tool, our
changepoint detection method not only triggers alerts, but provides useful
information about the structural breaks, such as the times of changepoints, and
estimation of mean levels and linear slopes before and after the changepoints.
This makes future business analysis and evaluation on the structural breaks
easier.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01793v1

cluster stars. This population, referred to as the ``extended P1'', has been
suggested to be the manifestation of a new abundance pattern where the initial
mass fraction of He changes among cluster stars that share the same CNO values.
The current paradigm for the formation of the multiple stellar populations in
globular clusters assumes that variations in He are the product of chemical
``enrichment'' by the ashes of the CNO-cycle (which changes He and other
elements like C, N and O simultaneously). We obtained MIKE@Magellan spectra of
six giant stars in NGC 2808, a cluster with one of the strongest examples of
the extended P1 population. We provide the first complete characterization of
the light elements abundances for the stars along a significant range of the
extended P1 photometric group. The stars from our sample appear to be
homogeneous in C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al. The lack of a significant change in
these products of the CNO-cycle, suggest that unlike the rest of the
populations identified to date, the photometric changes responsible for the
extended P1 feature are a consequence of an alternative mechanism. Our
measurements, are consistent with the interpretations where the changes of the
He mass fraction among these stars could be consequence of p-p chain
nucleosynthesis (which could increase the He in stars without affecting heavier
elements). Having said that, direct measurements of He are necessary to
conclude if variations of this element are present among extended P1 stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03621v1

benefit to vehicles. The results show that lane changing with transferable
utility between drivers can help achieve win-win results, improve both
individual and social benefits without resulting in any adverse effects on

"On Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbations for Sequence-to-Sequence
  Models",2019-03-15T16:04:11Z,"Paul Michel, Xian Li, Graham Neubig, Juan Miguel Pino","Adversarial examples --- perturbations to the input of a model that elicit
large changes in the output --- have been shown to be an effective way of
assessing the robustness of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. However,
these perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change
the input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the
expected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the
growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on
machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial
attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and
post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that
existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the
aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in
changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate
that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial
perturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change
the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial
training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of
adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance. A toolkit
implementing our evaluation framework is released at

"A Longitudinal Study of Static Analysis Warning Evolution and the
  Effects of PMD on Software Quality in Apache Open Source Projects",2019-12-02T16:37:10Z,"Alexander Trautsch, Steffen Herbold, Jens Grabowski","Automated static analysis tools (ASATs) have become a major part of the
software development workflow. Acting on the generated warnings, i.e., changing
the code indicated in the warning, should be part of, at latest, the code
review phase. Despite this being a best practice in software development, there
is still a lack of empirical research regarding the usage of ASATs in the wild.
In this work, we want to study ASAT warning trends in software via the example
of PMD as an ASAT and its usage in open source projects. We analyzed the commit
history of 54 projects (with 112,266 commits in total), taking into account 193
PMD rules and 61 PMD releases. We investigate trends of ASAT warnings over up
to 17 years for the selected study subjects regarding changes of warning types,
short and long term impact of ASAT use, and changes in warning severities. We
found that large global changes in ASAT warnings are mostly due to coding style
changes regarding braces and naming conventions. We also found that,
surprisingly, the influence of the presence of PMD in the build process of the
project on warning removal trends for the number of warnings per lines of code
is small and not statistically significant. Regardless, if we consider defect
density as a proxy for external quality, we see a positive effect if PMD is
present in the build configuration of our study subjects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02179v3
"Microscopyc description of the Photothermal increase of temperature for
  metallic nanoparticles excited with short-laser pulses",2019-04-03T17:14:34Z,"M. Rodr√≠guez-Matus, C. Garcia-Segundo, Jean-Parick Connerade","The pulsed photothermal phenomenon due to optically absorbed energy, result
from non-radiative decay mechanisms, which in nature, these imply the temporal
change in the local free energy and thus a temporary change in the local
temperature. At the nanoscale, this is a prediction broadly described in terms
of macroscopic variables. Here we introduce a formalism based on the
Jarzynski's physical statistics description, for interpreting the equilibrium
free energy difference between two configurations of a metallic nanoparticle.
In this way, within a finite-time span, we describe the temporal increase of
the local free energy and thus of the local temperature arising from
temporarily bringing the sample far from thermal equilibrium. The result is an
expression for which one can get the photothermally induced change of
temperature for a metallic nanoparticle. For practical purposes, we limited the
study to Au nanoparticles. The study is made as function of the particle size
and the optical properties for wavelengths spanning the optical range. The
assessment indicates that, for nanoparticles with radii shorter than 40 nm, the
temperature change is strongly dependent on particle size and on the
illumination wavelength. While, for near 40 nm particle radii, the current
description and the known formalism, based on macroscopic variables, predict
the very same temperature change. At the closing we discuss additional possible
thermodynamic consequences associated to the scale considerations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02109v1
Polarization of changing-look quasars,2019-04-08T09:40:24Z,"D. Hutsem√©kers, B. Ag√≠s Gonz√°lez, F. Marin, D. Sluse, C. Ramos Almeida, J. -A. Acosta Pulido","If the disappearance of the broad emission lines observed in changing-look
quasars originates from the obscuration of the quasar core by dusty clouds
moving in the torus, high linear optical polarization would be expected in
those objects. We then measured the rest-frame UV-blue linear polarization of a
sample of 13 changing-look quasars, 7 of them being in a type 1.9-2 state. For
all quasars but one the polarization degree is lower than 1%. This suggests
that the disappearance of the broad emission lines cannot be attributed to dust
obscuration, and supports the scenario in which changes of look are caused by a
change in the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Such low
polarization degrees also indicate that these quasars are seen under
inclinations close to the system axis. One type 1.9-2 quasar in our sample
shows a high polarization degree of 6.8%. While this polarization could be
ascribed to obscuration by a moving dusty cloud, we argue that this is unlikely
given the very long time needed for a cloud from the torus to eclipse the broad
emission line region of that object. We propose that the high polarization is
due to the echo of a past bright phase seen in polar-scattered light. This
interpretation raises the possibility that broad emission lines observed in the
polarized light of some type 2 active galactic nuclei can be echoes of past
type 1 phases and not evidence of hidden broad emission line regions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03914v1
"Region homogeneity in the Logarithmic Image Processing framework:
  application to region growing algorithms",2019-04-17T12:34:28Z,"Guillaume Noyel, Michel Jourlin","In order to create an image segmentation method robust to lighting changes,
two novel homogeneity criteria of an image region were studied. Both were
defined using the Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) framework whose laws model
lighting changes. The first criterion estimates the LIP-additive homogeneity
and is based on the LIP-additive law. It is theoretically insensitive to
lighting changes caused by variations of the camera exposure-time or source
intensity. The second, the LIP-multiplicative homogeneity criterion, is based
on the LIP-multiplicative law and is insensitive to changes due to variations
of the object thickness or opacity. Each criterion is then applied in Revol and
Jourlin's (1997) region growing method which is based on the homogeneity of an
image region. The region growing method becomes therefore robust to the
lighting changes specific to each criterion. Experiments on simulated and on
real images presenting lighting variations prove the robustness of the criteria
to those variations. Compared to a state-of the art method based on the image
component-tree, ours is more robust. These results open the way to numerous
applications where the lighting is uncontrolled or partially controlled.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12597v1
"Epistasis between cultural traits drives paradigm shifts in cultural
  evolution",2019-04-29T22:06:09Z,"Ignacio Pascual, Jacobo Aguirre, Susanna Manrubia, Jos√© A. Cuesta","Every now and then the cultural paradigm of a society changes. Human history
can be regarded as a sequence of long periods of cultural stasis punctuated by
paradigm shifts that transform culture upside-down over the turn of a few
generations. We propose here a population dynamics model devised to analyse
paradigm shifts. In this model individuals are defined by a vector of cultural
traits that can change mainly through imitation of other individuals' traits.
The novelty of the model is that cultural traits may interact reinforcing or
hindering each other. Imitation is then biased by the 'cultural fitness'
landscape thus defined. Our main result is that abrupt paradigm shifts occur,
as a response to weak changes in the landscape, only when cultural traits do
interact---whereas adaptation is smooth if there is no interaction. Borrowing
the genetic term, this interaction is called 'cultural epistasis'. The result
is robust to the way that epistasis is implemented, to whether imitation is
biased by homophily, or to changes in other model parameters. Finally, a
relevant consequence of this dynamics is the irreversible nature of paradigm
shifts: the old paradigm cannot be restored even if the external changes are
undone. Our model puts the phenomenon of paradigm shifts in cultural evolution
in the same category as catastrophic shifts in ecology or phase transitions in
physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12972v1
"Signal detection using biphotons and potential application in axion-like
  particle search",2019-07-24T22:19:59Z,"Phuong Hoang Le, Binh Xuan Cao","This paper presents a new optical system for detecting light signals
associated with the change in incoming photon number. The system employs
quantum correlation of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC). The signal, if present, will perturb the flux of the
incident photon stream. The perturbed photon stream is first projected through
a birefringent crystal where SPDC occurs, converting a single high-energy
photon into a pair of low energy photons. The photons in each pair eventually
arrive at separate detectors. By examining the biphoton correlation using the
probability distribution of the photons at the detectors, which varies
depending on the displacement of the main pump photon stream and the change in
the number of photons, the small optical displacement of the photon stream and
its variance can be determined. The change in incident photon number, in other
words, the presence of light signal does not influence the average of the
measured optical displacement values. Nevertheless, the change in optical
displacement measurement variance when the number of incident photons has
changed detects the light signal. This optical setup enables the detection of
light signals with low noise and remarkably high precision and sensitivity
using quantum correlation. The proposed technique has potential application for
axion-like particle search in experimental high energy physics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10757v2

  molecular dynamics study",2019-07-27T21:02:32Z,"Mohammad-Reza Basaadat, Mahmoud Payami","In a nuclear reactor, the Zr-$x$Nb alloy, which is used as a structural
material in the core region, is irradiated by energetic particles that cause
the atoms to be displaced from their lattice sites and giving rise to crystal
defects. The local changes in the atomic arrangements lead to local
deformations of the solid and thereby changes of its local mechanical
properties. Understanding the mechanisms behind this evolution in the core
region of a reactor, and its monitoring or controlling is a critical task in
nuclear industry. In this work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations,
we have studied the effects of radiation damage on the local mechanical
properties of Zr-$x$Nb alloy. In the first step, the effect of Nb-concentration
on the mechanical stability of homogeneous Zr-$x$Nb alloy is investigated. In
the second step, we have studied the local changes of the elastic constants due

that change type within a short timescale of years or decades. This change is
characterised by the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines, often
associated with dramatic AGN continuum flux changes that are orders of
magnitude larger than those expected from typical AGN variability. In this work
we study for the first time the host galaxy of a changing-look AGN, Mrk 590,
using high spatial resolution optical and near-infrared observations. We
discover that after ~ 10 yr absence, the optical broad emission lines of Mrk

times lower than that observed during the most luminous state in the 1990s. The
host galaxy shows a 4.5 kpc radius star-forming ring with knots of ionised and
cold molecular gas emission. Extended ionised and warm molecular gas emission
are detected in the nucleus, indicating that there is a reservoir of gas as
close as 60 pc from the black hole. We observe a nuclear gas spiral between
radii r ~ 0.5 - 2 kpc, which has been suggested as a dynamical mechanism able
to drive the necessary gas to fuel AGN. We also discover blue-shifted and high

"Sudden and Steady Orbital Period Changes Across the Classical Nova
  Eruptions of DQ Her and BT Mon",2019-12-12T19:25:31Z,Bradley E. Schaefer,"I report two new measures of the sudden change in the orbital period ($P$)
across the nova eruption ($\Delta$P) and the steady period change in quiescence
($\dot{P}$) for classical novae (CNe) DQ Her and BT Mon. The fractional changes
($\Delta$P/P) in parts-per-million (ppm) are $-$4.46$\pm$0.03 for DQ Her and
+39.6$\pm$0.5 for BT Mon. For BT Mon, the $\Delta$P/P value is not large enough
(i.e., $>$1580 ppm) to allow for Hibernation in this system. The {\it negative}
$\Delta$P/P for DQ Her is a confident counterexample of the Hibernation model
for the evolution of cataclysmic variables. Further, published models of period
changes by nova eruptions do not allow for such a negative value, so some
additional mechanism is required, with this perhaps being due to asymmetric
ejection of material. My program has also measured the first long-term
$\dot{P}$ for CNe, with 0.00$\pm$0.02 for DQ Her and $-$2.3$\pm$0.1 for BT Mon,
all with units of $10^{-11}$ days/cycle. These can be directly compared to the
predictions of the Magnetic Braking model, where the long-term average
$\dot{P}$ is a single universal function of $P$. The predicted values are
-0.027 for DQ Her and -0.33 for BT Mon. For both novae, the measured $\dot{P}$
is significantly far from the predictions for Magnetic Braking. Further, the
observed $\Delta$P for BT Mon imposes an additional {\it positive} period
change of +0.60$\times$10$^{-11}$ days/cycle when averaged over the eruption
cycle, so this system actually has a long-term {\it rise} in $P$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06169v1
CORE: Automating Review Recommendation for Code Changes,2019-12-20T06:14:18Z,"JingKai Siow, Cuiyun Gao, Lingling Fan, Sen Chen, Yang Liu","Code review is a common process that is used by developers, in which a
reviewer provides useful comments or points out defects in the submitted source
code changes via pull request. Code review has been widely used for both
industry and open-source projects due to its capacity in early defect
identification, project maintenance, and code improvement. With rapid updates
on project developments, code review becomes a non-trivial and labor-intensive
task for reviewers. Thus, an automated code review engine can be beneficial and
useful for project development in practice. Although there exist prior studies
on automating the code review process by adopting static analysis tools or deep
learning techniques, they often require external sources such as partial or
full source code for accurate review suggestion. In this paper, we aim at
automating the code review process only based on code changes and the
corresponding reviews but with better performance. The hinge of accurate code
review suggestion is to learn good representations for both code changes and
reviews. To achieve this with limited source, we design a multi-level embedding
(i.e., word embedding and character embedding) approach to represent the
semantics provided by code changes and reviews. The embeddings are then well
trained through a proposed attentional deep learning model, as a whole named
CORE. We evaluate the effectiveness of CORE on code changes and reviews
collected from 19 popular Java projects hosted on Github. Experimental results
show that our model CORE can achieve significantly better performance than the
state-of-the-art model (DeepMem), with an increase of 131.03% in terms of
Recall@10 and 150.69% in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank. Qualitative general
word analysis among project developers also demonstrates the performance of

is a vital task in the monitoring of patients undergoing disease-modifying
treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, the definition of 'new or enlarged'
is not fixed, and it is known that lesion-counting is highly subjective, with
high degree of inter- and intra-rater variability. Automated methods for lesion
quantification hold the potential to make the detection of new and enlarged
lesions consistent and repeatable. However, the majority of lesion segmentation
algorithms are not evaluated for their ability to separate progressive from
stable patients, despite this being a pressing clinical use-case. In this paper
we show that change in volumetric measurements of lesion load alone is not a
good method for performing this separation, even for highly performing
segmentation methods. Instead, we propose a method for identifying lesion
changes of high certainty, and establish on a dataset of longitudinal multiple
sclerosis cases that this method is able to separate progressive from stable
timepoints with a very high level of discrimination (AUC = 0.99), while changes
in lesion volume are much less able to perform this separation (AUC = 0.71).
Validation of the method on a second external dataset confirms that the method
is able to generalize beyond the setting in which it was trained, achieving an
accuracy of 83% in separating stable and progressive timepoints. Both lesion
volume and count have previously been shown to be strong predictors of disease
course across a population. However, we demonstrate that for individual
patients, changes in these measures are not an adequate means of establishing
no evidence of disease activity. Meanwhile, directly detecting tissue which
changes, with high confidence, from non-lesion to lesion is a feasible
methodology for identifying radiologically active patients.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03041v1

Small-Instanton Transitions in F-theory,2019-11-28T19:50:32Z,"Stephen Angus, Kang-Sin Choi","We study the phase transition between G-instantons and D3-branes. A
G-instanton is a classical solution to the self-dual equation of the M/F-theory

an equivariant open embedding in a normal toric variety which is proper over
the valuation ring, after a base-change by a finite extension of valuation
rings. If the value group $\Gamma$ is discrete or divisible then no base-change
is needed. We give explicit examples which show that existing methods do not
produce such normal equivariant completions. Our approach is combinatorial and
proceeds by showing that $\Gamma$-admissible fans admit $\Gamma$-admissible

statistical optics literature. Here, we consider the scattering of partially
coherent radiation by a deterministic periodic medium, symmetric under the
simultaneous transformations of parity inversion and time reversal, that is, a
parity-time (PT)-symmetric periodic medium. Taking into account light
fluctuations, one is able to describe the spectrum changes on propagation and
the influence of the coherence-driven angular divergence effect. The far-field
spectral density profile is found to depend crucially on the loss/gain

SlideVaR: a risk measure with variable risk attitudes,2019-07-27T06:44:30Z,Wentao Hu,"To find a trade-off between profitability and prudence, financial

recently received great interest due to its potential to improve the
magnetocaloric effect (MCE) for the purpose of magnetic cooling applications.
Here we propose a new mechanism for a giant inverse MCE in rare-earth
tetraborides, especially for Ho1-xDyxB4 (x = 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0). For x = 0.0,
0.5, and 1.0, the maximum entropy changes of the giant inverse MCE are found to
be 22.7 J/kgK, 19.6 J/kgK, and 19.0 J/kgK with critical fields of 25 kOe, 40
kOe, and 50 kOe, respectively. It is remarkable that such a giant MCE is
realized, even when applying a low magnetic field, which enables a field-tuned
entropy change and brings about a significant advantage for several
applications. For all compounds, we have systematically studied how the entropy
changes as a function of the field and temperature and investigated their
correlation with consecutive double transitions, i.e., the magnetic dipolar
order at T = TN and the quadrupolar order at T = TQ (TQ < TN). We found that
the maximum entropy change occurs at T = TQ and the critical field associated
with the meta-magnetic transition, which is in good agreement with the
experimental data. Thus, we elucidate that this unique behaviour is attributed
to the strong coupling between magnetic dipoles and quadrupoles in the presence
of strong spin-orbit coupling and geometric frustration. Our work offers new
insights into both the academic interest of multipolar degrees of freedom in
magnetic materials and the discovery of giant MCE with various applications for
magnetic cooling systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02576v1

"Fitting stochastic epidemic models to gene genealogies using linear
  noise approximation",2019-02-24T02:24:16Z,"Mingwei Tang, Gytis Dudas, Trevor Bedford, Vladimir N. Minin","Phylodynamics is a set of population genetics tools that aim at
reconstructing demographic history of a population based on molecular sequences
of individuals sampled from the population of interest. One important task in
phylodynamics is to estimate changes in (effective) population size. When
applied to infectious disease sequences such estimation of population size
trajectories can provide information about changes in the number of infections.
To model changes in the number of infected individuals, current phylodynamic
methods use non-parametric approaches, parametric approaches, and stochastic
modeling in conjunction with likelihood-free Bayesian methods. The first class
of methods yields results that are hard-to-interpret epidemiologically. The
second class of methods provides estimates of important epidemiological
parameters, such as infection and removal/recovery rates, but ignores variation
in the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The third class of methods is the
most advantageous statistically, but relies on computationally intensive
particle filtering techniques that limits its applications. We propose a
Bayesian model that combines phylodynamic inference and stochastic epidemic
models, and achieves computational tractability by using a linear noise
approximation (LNA) --- a technique that allows us to approximate probability
densities of stochastic epidemic model trajectories. LNA opens the door for
using modern Markov chain Monte Carlo tools to approximate the joint posterior
distribution of the disease transmission parameters and of high dimensional
vectors describing unobserved changes in the stochastic epidemic model

Shear-induced electrical changes in the base of thin layer-cloud,2019-11-01T14:42:58Z,"R Giles Harrison, Graeme Marlton, Karen L Aplin, Keri Nicoll","Charging of upper and lower horizontal boundaries of extensive layer clouds
results from current flow in the global electric circuit. Layer-cloud charge
accumulation has previously been considered a solely electrostatic phenomenon,
but it does not occur in isolation from meteorological processes, which can
transport charge. Thin layer clouds provide special circumstances for
investigating this dynamical charge transport, as disruption at the cloud-top
may reach the cloud base, observable from the surface. Here, a thin (~300 m)
persistent layer-cloud with base at 300 m and strong wind shear at cloud-top
was observed to generate strongly correlated fluctuations in cloud base height,
optical thickness and surface electric Potential Gradient (PG) beneath. PG
changes are identified to precede the cloud base fluctuations by 2 minutes,
consistent with shear-induced cloud-top electrical changes followed by cloud
base changes. These observations demonstrate, for the first time, dynamically
driven modification of charge within a layer-cloud. Even in weakly charged
layer-clouds, redistribution of charge will modify local electric fields within
the cloud and the collisional behaviour of interacting charged cloud droplets.

respect to the cosmic microwave background also changes redshifts measured at
multiple epochs. If not accounted for, it yields a biased cosmological
inference. To address this, we calculate the acceleration of Solar System with
respect to the Local Group of galaxies to quantify the change in the measured
redshift due to local motion. Our study is motivated by the recent
determination of the mass of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which indicates a
significant fraction of the Milky Way mass. We find that the acceleration
towards the Galactic Center dominates, which gives a redshift change of 7 cm/s
in 10 years, while the accelerations due to LMC and M31 cannot be ignored

Response Prediction for Low-Regret Agents,2019-11-05T19:51:18Z,"Saeed Alaei, Ashwinkumar Badanidiyuru, Mohammad Mahdian, Sadra Yazdanbod","Companies like Google and Microsoft run billions of auctions every day to

have a tremendous effect on the revenue of the company and the welfare of the
advertisers and the users. Therefore, any change requires careful evaluation of
its potential impacts. Currently, such impacts are often evaluated by running
simulations or small controlled experiments. This, however, misses the
important factor that the advertisers respond to changes. Our goal is to build
a theoretical framework for predicting the actions of an agent (the advertiser)

problem using a variant of the multi-armed bandit setting where playing an arm
is costly. The cost of each arm changes over time and is publicly observable.
The value of playing an arm is drawn stochastically from a static distribution
and is observed by the agent and not by us. We, however, observe the actions of
the agent. Our main result is that assuming the agent is playing a strategy
with a regret of at most $f(T)$ within the first $T$ rounds, we can learn to
play the multi-armed bandits game (without observing the rewards) in such a way

an ultraviolet cut off $\Lambda$, parametrized as $ln(\Lambda^2)$. In the
present paper I demonstrate that, when going to Two Higgs Doublet Models, the
result stays the same as in the previous paper, up to $M_{SM}^2/M_H^2$
corrections, where $M_{SM}$ is the mass of the top-quark or the $W$-boson.
$M_H$ is the mass of the heavy neutral scalar Higgs-boson $H$ which is much
heavier than the light neutral Higgs boson $h$ with mass $M_h$. In the limit
$M_H^2 \gg M_h^2$, the $ln(\Lambda^2)$ behaviour in the previous paper is
replaced by $ln(\widetilde{M_H}^2)$, where $\widetilde{M_H}$ is of order $M_H$.
I also explain how some divergences due to exchange of the pseudoscalar Higgs
$A$ are cancelled by similar contributions from the scalar heavy Higgs $H$, and
that these contributions, and finite contributions from $A$-exchange, are
suppressed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07291v4

analytics on the live video on embedded or mobile devices has become an
important system driver. Considering that such devices, e.g., surveillance
cameras or AR/VR gadgets, are resource constrained, creating lightweight deep
neural networks (DNNs) for embedded devices is crucial. None of the current
approximation techniques for object classification DNNs can adapt to changing
runtime conditions, e.g., changes in resource availability on the device, the
content characteristics, or requirements from the user. In this paper, we
introduce ApproxNet, a video object classification system for embedded or
mobile clients. It enables novel dynamic approximation techniques to achieve
desired inference latency and accuracy trade-off under changing runtime
conditions. It achieves this by enabling two approximation knobs within a
single DNN model, rather than creating and maintaining an ensemble of models
(e.g., MCDNN [MobiSys-16]. We show that ApproxNet can adapt seamlessly at
runtime to these changes, provides low and stable latency for the image and

offer remarkable insights into the evolution of language and provide a tool for
quantifying sociocultural change from text documents. Prior work has used such
embeddings to identify shifts in the meaning of individual words. However,
simply knowing that a word has changed in meaning is insufficient to identify
the instances of word usage that convey the historical or the newer meaning. In
this paper, we link diachronic word embeddings to documents, by situating those
documents as leaders or laggards with respect to ongoing semantic changes.
Specifically, we propose a novel method to quantify the degree of semantic
progressiveness in each word usage, and then show how these usages can be
aggregated to obtain scores for each document. We analyze two large collections
of documents, representing legal opinions and scientific articles. Documents
that are scored as semantically progressive receive a larger number of

provides a new technique for identifying lexical semantic leaders and

Topological theory of physical fields,2019-09-11T03:10:42Z,"Amir Jafari, Ethan Vishniac","We study the topology associated with physical vector and scalar fields. A
mathematical object, e.g., a ball, can be continuously deformed, without
tearing or gluing, to make other topologically equivalent objects, e.g., a cube
or a solid disk. If tearing or gluing get involved, i.e., the deformation is
not continuous anymore, the initial topology will consequently change giving
rise to a topologically distinct object, e.g., a torus. This simple concept in
general topology may be employed in the study of physical systems described by
fields. Instead of continuously deforming objects, we can take a continuously
evolving field, with an appropriately defined topology, such that the topology
remains unchanged in time unless the system undergoes an important physical
change, e.g., a transition to a different energy state. For instance, a sudden
change in the magnetic topology in an energetically relaxing plasma, a process
called reconnection, strongly affects the dynamics, e.g., it is involved in
launching solar flares and generating large scale magnetic fields in
astrophysical objects. In this topological formalism, the magnetic topology in
a plasma can spontaneously change due to the presence of dissipative terms in
the induction equation which break its time symmetry. We define a topology for
the vector field $\bf F$ in the phase space $(\bf x, F)$. As for scalar fields
represented by a perfect fluid, e.g., the inhomogeneous inflaton or Higgs
fields, the fluid velocity $\bf u$ defines the corresponding topology. The
vector field topology in its corresponding phase space $(\bf x, F)$ will be
preserved in time if certain conditions including time reversal invariance are
satisfied by the field and its governing differential equation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04836v3
"A new concept of technology with systemic-purposeful perpsective:
  theory, examples and empirical application",2019-09-11T08:18:37Z,Mario Coccia,"Although definitions of technology exist to explain the patterns of
technological innovations, there is no general definition that explain the role
of technology for humans and other animal species in environment. The goal of
this study is to suggest a new concept of technology with a systemic-purposeful
perspective for technology analysis. Technology here is a complex system of
artifact, made and_or used by living systems, that is composed of more than one
entity or sub-system and a relationship that holds between each entity and at
least one other entity in the system, selected considering practical, technical
and_or economic characteristics to satisfy needs, achieve goals and_or solve
problems of users for purposes of adaptation and_or survival in environment.
Technology T changes current modes of cognition and action to enable makers
and_or users to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with
consequential environmental threats. Technology, as a complex system, is formed
by different elements given by incremental and radical innovations.
Technological change generates the progress from a system T1 to T2, T3, etc.
driven by changes of technological trajectories and technological paradigms.
Several examples illustrate here these concepts and a simple model with a
preliminary empirical analysis shows how to operationalize the suggested
definition of technology. Overall, then, the role of adaptation (i.e.
reproductive advantage) can be explained as a main driver of technology use for
adopters to take advantage of important opportunities or to cope with
environmental threats. This study begins the process of clarifying and
generalizing, as far as possible, the concept of technology with a new
perspective that it can lay a foundation for the development of more
sophisticated concepts and theories to explain technological and economic
change in environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05689v1
V2: Fast Detection of Configuration Drift in Python,2019-09-13T14:25:06Z,"Eric Horton, Chris Parnin","Code snippets are prevalent, but are hard to reuse because they often lack an
accompanying environment configuration. Most are not actively maintained,
allowing for drift between the most recent possible configuration and the code
snippet as the snippet becomes out-of-date over time. Recent work has
identified the problem of validating and detecting out-of-date code snippets as
the most important consideration for code reuse. However, determining if a
snippet is correct, but simply out-of-date, is a non-trivial task. In the best
case, breaking changes are well documented, allowing developers to manually
determine when a code snippet contains an out-of-date API usage. In the worst
case, determining if and when a breaking change was made requires an exhaustive
search through previous dependency versions.
  We present V2, a strategy for determining if a code snippet is out-of-date by
detecting discrete instances of configuration drift, where the snippet uses an
API which has since undergone a breaking change. Each instance of configuration
drift is classified by a failure encountered during validation and a
configuration patch, consisting of dependency version changes, which fixes the
underlying fault. V2 uses feedback-directed search to explore the possible
configuration space for a code snippet, reducing the number of potential
environment configurations that need to be validated. When run on a corpus of
public Python snippets from prior research, V2 identifies 248 instances of

microsensors able to detect local pH changes before irreversible damages caused
by demineralization, corrosion, or biofilms occur. One class of such
microsensors is based on molecular dyes encapsulated or dispersed either in

variations. They are efficient but often rely on sophisticated and costly
syntheses, and present significant risks of leakage and photobleaching damages,
which is detrimental for mainstream applications. Another approach consists in
exploiting the distance-dependent plasmonic properties of metallic
nanoparticles. Still, assembling nanoparticles into dispersible colloidal
pH-sensitive sensors remains a challenge. Here, we show how to combine
optically active plasmonic gold nanoparticles and pH-responsive thin shells

Concomitantly, the distance between the gold nanoparticles embedded in the
polymeric matrix varies, resulting in an unambiguous color change. Billions of
micron-size sensors can thus be easily fabricated. They are non-intrusive,
reusable, and sense local pH changes. Each plasmocapsule is an independent

than the bulk due to changed topologies and symmetry protections. The
outstanding problem is to find out if the exoticity of a material is linked to

photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) is a significantly bulk sensitive technique
(escape depth of valence electrons is about 40 \AA\ for 6 keV photon energy)
and the probing depth can be tuned by changing the electron emission angle.
Therefore, HAXPES is often used to reveal the surface-bulk differences in a

valence band spectral functions using this method is highly non-trivial due to
the complexity arising from linear dichroic effect in addition to the change in
surface sensitivity. We show that core level spectra can be used to reveal the
surface-bulk differences in the electronic structure. The Ca 2p spectra exhibit
evidence of significant hybridization with the conduction electrons revealing
their importance in the electronic properties of the system as also found for
the charge reservoir layers in cuprate superconductors. The Fe 2p core level

been focusing on the overall network performance with limited insight on the
potential impact of CAVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs). This paper aims to
quantify the influence of CAVs on HVs by studying the high-resolution vehicle
trajectory data that is obtained from microscopic simulation. Two clustering
strategies for CACC are implemented: an ad hoc coordination one and a local
coordination one. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad
hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of
network throughput and productivity. The greatest performance difference
between the two strategies is observed at 30% and 40% MPR for throughput and
productivity, respectively. However, the distributions of the hard braking
observations (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly under
local coordination strategy. Regardless of the clustering strategy, CAVs
increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. 30% MPR is the break-even
point for local coordination, after which the average lane change frequency
decreases from the peak 5.42 to 5.38. Such inverse relationship to MPR is not

corneal thickness (CCT) in keratoconus and normal corneas during air puff
indentation, by using corneal visualization Scheimpflug technology (Corvis ST).
Methods: A total of 32 keratoconic eyes and 46 normal eyes were included in
this study. Three parameters of CCTinitial, CCTfinal and CCTpeak were selected
to represent the CCT at initial time, final time and highest corneal concavity,
respectively, during air puff indentation. Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired
sample test) was used to assess the differences between these 3 parameters in
both keratoconus and normal groups. Univariate linear regression analysis was
performed to determine the effect of CCTinitial on CCTpeak and CCTfinal, as
well as the impact of air puff force on CCT in each group. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the discriminative
ability of the 3 parameters. Results: The results demonstrated that CCTpeak and
CCTfinal were significantly decreased (p<0.01) compared to CCTinitial in both
keratoconus and normal groups. Regression analysis indicated a significant
positive correlation between CCTpeak and CCTinitial in normal cornea group
(R2=0.337, p<0.01), but not in keratoconus group (R2=0.029, p=0.187). Likewise,
regression models of air puff force and CCT revealed the different patterns of
CCT changes between keratoconus and normal cornea groups. Furthermore, ROC
curves showed that CCTpeak exhibited the greatest AUC (area under ROC curve) of
0.940, with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 94.9%, 87.5% and 100%,

significantly different between keratoconus and normal cornea groups. The
changing pattern is useful for the diagnosis of keratoconus, and lays the

Parameter Estimation in Abruptly Changing Dynamic Environments,2019-01-15T06:44:44Z,"Hugo Lewi Hammer, Anis Yazidi","Many real-life dynamical systems change abruptly followed by almost
stationary periods. In this paper, we consider streams of data with such abrupt
behavior and investigate the problem of tracking their statistical properties
in an online manner.
  We devise a tracking procedure where an estimator that is suitable for a
stationary environment is combined together with an event detection method such
that the estimator rapidly can jump to a more suitable value if an event is
detected. Combining an estimation procedure with detection procedure is
commonly known idea in the literature. However, our contribution lies in
building the detection procedure based on the difference between the stationary
estimator and a Stochastic Learning Weak Estimator (SLWE). The SLWE estimator
is known to be the state-of-the art approach to tracking properties of
non-stationary environments and thus should be a better choice to detect
changes in abruptly changing environments than the far more common sliding
window based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the event detection
procedure suggested by Ross et al. (2012) is the only procedure in the
literature taking advantage of the powerful tracking properties of the SLWE
estimator. The procedure in Ross et al. is however quite complex and not well
founded theoretically compared to the procedures in this paper. In this paper,
we focus on estimation procedure for the binomial and multinomial
distributions, but our approach can be easily generalized to cover other
distributions as well.

polarimetry could act as a complement or limited proxy for VLBI observations of
blazars, in that the number of polarised emission components in the jet, and
some of their properties and those of the foreground environment, might be
inferred from the object's time-varying 1D Faraday depth spectrum (FDS) alone.
We report on a pilot-scale experiment designed to establish the basic
plausibility and utility of this idea. We analyse temporal changes in the
complex polarisation spectra of nine spatially unresolved (at arcsecond scales)
blazars in two epochs separated by $\sim$5 years, using data taken with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. The data allow for precise modelling, and we
demonstrate that all objects in our sample show changes in their polarisation
spectrum that cannot be accounted for by uncertainties in calibration or
observational effects. By associating polarised emission components across
epochs, we infer changes in their number, intrinsic fractional polarisation,
intrinsic polarisation angle, rotation measure, and depolarisation
characteristics. We attribute these changes to evolution in the structure of
the blazar jets, most likely located at distances of up to tens of parsecs from
the central active galactic nuclei. Our results suggest that continued work in
this area is warranted; in particular, it will be important to determine the

Critical speeding up as an early warning signal of regime switching,2019-01-23T19:07:58Z,"Mathew Titus, Zach Gelbaum, James Watson","The use of critical slowing down as an early warning indicator for regime
switching in observations from stochastic environments and noisy dynamical
models has been widely studied and implemented in recent years. Some systems,
however, have been shown to avoid critical slowing down prior to a transition
between equilibria, e.g. (Ditlevsen and Johnsen, 2010). Possible explanations
include non-smooth potential driving the dynamic (Hastings and Wysham, 2010) or
large perturbations driving the system out of the initial basin of attraction.
In this paper we discuss a phenomenon analogous to critical slowing down, where
a slow parameter change leads to a high likelihood of a regime shift and
creates signature warning signs in the statistics of the process's sample
paths. In short, if a basin of attraction is compressed under a parameter
change then the potential well steepens, leading to a drop in the time series'
variance and autocorrelation; precisely the opposite warning signs exhibited by
critical slowing down. This effect, which we call `critical speeding up,' is
demonstrated using a simple ecological model exhibiting an Allee effect. The
fact that both dropping and rising variance / autocorrelation can indicate
imminent state change should underline the need for reliable modeling of any
empirical system where one desires to forecast regime change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08084v1

treatment of imitation dynamics which result from regular population mobility
across residential and work areas and the ensuing interactions. Each considered
SIR-network model captures a class of vaccination behaviours influenced by
epidemic characteristics, interaction topology, and imitation dynamics. Our
focus is the eventual vaccination coverage, produced under voluntary
vaccination schemes, in response to these varying factors. Using the next
generation matrix method, we analytically derive and compare expressions for
the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for the proposed SIR-network models.
Furthermore, we simulate the epidemic dynamics over time for the considered
models, and show that if individuals are sufficiently responsive towards the
changes in the disease prevalence, then the more expansive travelling patterns
encourage convergence to the endemic, mixed equilibria. On the contrary, if
individuals are insensitive to changes in the disease prevalence, we find that
they tend to remain unvaccinated in all the studied models. Our results concur
with earlier studies in showing that residents from highly connected
residential areas are more likely to get vaccinated. We also show that the
existence of the individuals committed to receiving vaccination reduces $R_0$

cross-section below 2 nm produce a detectable conductance change at room
temperature. For larger nanowires the sensitivity is reduced, however the
conductance change grows with the number of charged molecules: with sub-4 nm
nanowires being sensitive enough to detect several tens of charge carriers. We
propose using noise spectroscopy to access the temporal evolution of the charge
states. Information regarding the spatial distribution of charge carries in
organic thin films can be obtained using a grid of nanowire resistors and

  Self-Normalization",2019-05-21T05:30:11Z,"Runmin Wang, Changbo Zhu, Stanislav Volgushev, Xiaofeng Shao","This article considers change point testing and estimation for a sequence of
high-dimensional data. In the case of testing for a mean shift for
high-dimensional independent data, we propose a new test which is based on
$U$-statistic in Chen and Qin (2010) and utilizes the self-normalization
principle [Shao (2010), Shao and Zhang (2010)]. Our test targets dense
alternatives in the high-dimensional setting and involves no tuning parameters.
To extend to change point testing for high-dimensional time series, we
introduce a trimming parameter and formulate a self-normalized test statistic
with trimming to accommodate the weak temporal dependence. On the theory front,
we derive the limiting distributions of self-normalized test statistics under
both the null and alternatives for both independent and dependent
high-dimensional data. At the core of our asymptotic theory, we obtain weak
convergence of a sequential U-statistic based process for high-dimensional
independent data, and weak convergence of sequential trimmed U-statistic based
processes for high-dimensional linear processes, both of which are of
independent interests. Additionally, we illustrate how our tests can be used in
combination with wild binary segmentation to estimate the number and location
of multiple change points. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
competitiveness of our proposed testing and estimation procedures in comparison
with several existing methods in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08446v2
Switching 2D Magnetic States via Pressure Tuning of Layer Stacking,2019-05-26T19:14:50Z,"Tiancheng Song, Zaiyao Fei, Matthew Yankowitz, Zhong Lin, Qianni Jiang, Kyle Hwangbo, Qi Zhang, Bosong Sun, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael A. McGuire, David Graf, Ting Cao, Jiun-Haw Chu, David H. Cobden, Cory R. Dean, Di Xiao, Xiaodong Xu","The physical properties of two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) crystals
depend sensitively on the interlayer coupling, which is intimately connected to
the stacking arrangement and the interlayer spacing. For example, simply
changing the twist angle between graphene layers can induce a variety of
correlated electronic phases, which can be controlled further in a continuous
manner by applying hydrostatic pressure to decrease the interlayer spacing. In
the recently discovered 2D magnets, theory suggests that the interlayer
exchange coupling strongly depends on layer separation, while the stacking
arrangement can even change the sign of the magnetic exchange, thus drastically
modifying the ground state. Here, we demonstrate pressure tuning of magnetic
order in the 2D magnet CrI3. We probe the magnetic states using tunneling and
scanning magnetic circular dichroism microscopy measurements. We find that the
interlayer magnetic coupling can be more than doubled by hydrostatic pressure.
In bilayer CrI3, pressure induces a transition from layered antiferromagnetic
to ferromagnetic phases. In trilayer CrI3, pressure can create coexisting
domains of three phases, one ferromagnetic and two distinct antiferromagnetic.
The observed changes in magnetic order can be explained by changes in the
stacking arrangement. Such coupling between stacking order and magnetism
provides ample opportunities for designer magnetic phases and functionalities.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10860v1
Power laws in code repositories: A skeptical approach,2019-05-27T08:48:42Z,"Bartolom√© Ortiz, J. J. Merelo-Guerv√≥s","Software development as done using modern methodologies and source control
management systems, has been often established as an example of
self-organization, with code growing and evolving organically, through
activities that do not stem from entralized power, leader or directives. The
main challenge in proving these claims is that self organization cannot be
detected through direct observation, but through measurements on the system,
looking for hints such as the existence of power laws over some features, such
as the size of changes over time. The problem we intend to tackle in this paper
is to establish a methodology for checking, for a chosen set of repositories we
had already measured in the past, if the claims about power laws actually hold
from a precise mathematical point of view, since, although shown as pervasive
in the software engineering literature (and others), power laws are more
elusive than they might seem at first sight. For that reason, in this paper we
present a statistically accurate set of tests that will help us decide, from
the way repositories are changing, if they are really distributed by a power
law, which could indicate us the existence of a state reached via
self-organization, or actually, how accurately a power law fits the observed
distribution of the size of changes of commits in git repositories of 16 open
source repositories. We revisit one of the most representative papers of these
observations to reevaluate its results and compare them with the current status
of the repositories analyzed in it, trying to elucidate if there has been any

Cerberus: A Multi-headed Derenderer,2019-05-28T17:00:03Z,"Boyang Deng, Simon Kornblith, Geoffrey Hinton","To generalize to novel visual scenes with new viewpoints and new object
poses, a visual system needs representations of the shapes of the parts of an
object that are invariant to changes in viewpoint or pose. 3D graphics
representations disentangle visual factors such as viewpoints and lighting from
object structure in a natural way. It is possible to learn to invert the
process that converts 3D graphics representations into 2D images, provided the
3D graphics representations are available as labels. When only the unlabeled
images are available, however, learning to derender is much harder. We consider
a simple model which is just a set of free floating parts. Each part has its
own relation to the camera and its own triangular mesh which can be deformed to
model the shape of the part. At test time, a neural network looks at a single
image and extracts the shapes of the parts and their relations to the camera.
Each part can be viewed as one head of a multi-headed derenderer. During
training, the extracted parts are used as input to a differentiable 3D renderer
and the reconstruction error is backpropagated to train the neural net. We make
the learning task easier by encouraging the deformations of the part meshes to
be invariant to changes in viewpoint and invariant to the changes in the
relative positions of the parts that occur when the pose of an articulated body
changes. Cerberus, our multi-headed derenderer, outperforms previous methods
for extracting 3D parts from single images without part annotations, and it
does quite well at extracting natural parts of human figures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11940v1

Here we show that the photoluminescence of pixel arrays of an atomically thin
two-dimensional (2D) material, a monolayer of MoS$_{2}$, can image spatial and
temporal changes in redox molecule concentration in real time. Because of the
strong dependence of MoS$_{2}$ photoluminescence on doping and sensitivity to
surface changes characteristic of 2D materials, changes in the local chemical
potential significantly modulate the photoluminescence of MoS$_{2}$, with a

are becoming increasingly prevalent, being therefore necessary to learn in an
online manner. These conditions usually impose memory and processing time
restrictions, and they often turn into evolving environments where a change may
affect the input data distribution. Such a change causes that predictive models
trained over these stream data become obsolete and do not adapt suitably to new
distributions. Specially in these non-stationary scenarios, there is a pressing
need for new algorithms that adapt to these changes as fast as possible, while
maintaining good performance scores. Unfortunately, most off-the-shelf
classification models need to be retrained if they are used in changing
environments, and fail to scale properly. Spiking Neural Networks have revealed
themselves as one of the most successful approaches to model the behavior and
learning potential of the brain, and exploit them to undertake practical online
learning tasks. Besides, some specific flavors of Spiking Neural Networks can
overcome the necessity of retraining after a drift occurs. This work intends to

experimentally observe a change in ground state magnetic order from

Lorentz transmission electron microscopy on thermally annealed cobalt arrays.
The change in ordering leads to an apparent change in the nature of the defects

two-dimensional vortex-like structures in the ferromagnetic one, consistent
with the scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results show how

  Transitions",2019-08-28T13:04:28Z,"Tao Zhuo, Zhiyong Cheng, Peng Zhang, Yongkang Wong, Mohan Kankanhalli","Human action analysis and understanding in videos is an important and
challenging task. Although substantial progress has been made in past years,
the explainability of existing methods is still limited. In this work, we
propose a novel action reasoning framework that uses prior knowledge to explain
semantic-level observations of video state changes. Our method takes advantage
of both classical reasoning and modern deep learning approaches. Specifically,
prior knowledge is defined as the information of a target video domain,
including a set of objects, attributes and relationships in the target video
domain, as well as relevant actions defined by the temporal attribute and
relationship changes (i.e. state transitions). Given a video sequence, we first
generate a scene graph on each frame to represent concerned objects, attributes
and relationships. Then those scene graphs are linked by tracking objects
across frames to form a spatio-temporal graph (also called video graph), which
represents semantic-level video states. Finally, by sequentially examining each
state transition in the video graph, our method can detect and explain how
those actions are executed with prior knowledge, just like the logical manner
of thinking by humans. Compared to previous works, the action reasoning results
of our method can be explained by both logical rules and semantic-level
observations of video content changes. Besides, the proposed method can be used
to detect multiple concurrent actions with detailed information, such as who
(particular objects), when (time), where (object locations) and how (what kind
of changes). Experiments on a re-annotated dataset CAD-120 show the
effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10700v1

it dealing with change caused by uncertainties during operation, such as
changing availability of resources and fluctuating workloads. To ensure that
the system complies with the adaptation goals, recent research suggests the use
of formal techniques at runtime. Yet, existing approaches have three
limitations that affect their practical applicability: (i) they ignore
correctness of the behavior of the feedback loop, (ii) they rely on exhaustive
verification at runtime to select adaptation options to realize the adaptation
goals, which is time and resource demanding, and (iii) they provide limited or
no support for changing adaptation goals at runtime. To tackle these

persistent tissue population, is studied numerically and analytically in a
particle-based model of active tissues. Mutations change the properties of
cells in various ways, including their mechanical properties. Each mutation
results in an advantage or disadvantage to grow in the competition between
different cell types. While changes in signaling processes and biochemistry
play an important role, we focus on changes in the mechanical properties by
studying the result of variation of growth force and adhesive
cross-interactions between cell types. For independent mutations of growth
force and adhesion strength, the tissue evolves towards cell types with high
growth force and low internal adhesion strength, as both increase the
homeostatic pressure. Motivated by biological evidence, we postulate a coupling
between both parameters, such that an increased growth force comes at the cost
of a higher internal adhesion strength or vice versa. This tradeoff controls
the evolution of the tissue, ranging from unidirectional evolution to very
heterogeneous and dynamic populations. The special case of two competing cell
types reveals three distinct parameter regimes: Two in which one cell type
outcompetes the other, and one in which both cell types coexist in a highly
mixed state. Interestingly, a single mutated cell alone suffices to reach the
mixed state, while a finite mutation rate affects the results only weakly.
Finally, the coupling between changes in growth force and adhesion strength
reveals a mechanical explanation for the evolution towards intra-tumor
heterogeneity, in which multiple species coexist even under a constant
evolutianary pressure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03263v1
Dynamic Brain Functional Networks Guided By Anatomical Knowledge,2019-10-07T21:48:27Z,"Suprateek Kundu, Jin Ming, Jennifer Stevens","Recently, the potential of dynamic brain networks as a neuroimaging
biomarkers for mental illnesses is being increasingly recognized. However,
there are several unmet challenges in developing such biomarkers, including the
need for methods to model rapidly changing network states. In one of the first
such efforts, we develop a novel approach for computing dynamic brain
functional connectivity (FC), that is guided by brain structural connectivity
(SC) computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The proposed approach
involving dynamic Gaussian graphical models decomposes the time course into
non-overlapping state phases determined by change points, each having a
distinct network. We develop an optimization algorithm to implement the method
such that the estimation of both the change points and the state-phase specific
networks are fully data driven and unsupervised, and guided by SC information.
The approach is scalable to large dimensions and extensive simulations
illustrate its clear advantages over existing methods in terms of network
estimation accuracy and detecting dynamic network changes. An application of
the method to a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study reveals important
dynamic resting state connections in regions of the brain previously implicated
in PTSD. We also illustrate that the dynamic networks computed under the
proposed method are able to better predict psychological resilience among
trauma exposed individuals compared to existing dynamic and stationary
connectivity approaches, which highlights its potential as a neuroimaging

even if the self-driving technologies are ready. Therefore, human-driven
vehicles and autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coexist in a mixed traffic for a
long time. To enable AVs to safely and efficiently maneuver in this mixed
traffic, it is critical that the AVs can understand how humans cope with risks
and make driving-related decisions. On the other hand, the driving environment
is highly dynamic and ever-changing, and it is thus difficult to enumerate all
the scenarios and hard-code the controllers. To face up these challenges, in
this work, we incorporate a human decision-making model in reinforcement
learning to control AVs for safe and efficient operations. Specifically, we
adapt regret theory to describe a human driver's lane-changing behavior, and
fit the personalized models to individual drivers for predicting their
lane-changing decisions. The predicted decisions are incorporated in the safety
constraints for reinforcement learning in training and in implementation. We
then use an extended version of double deep Q-network (DDQN) to train our AV

ReLU networks is qualitatively different from that of networks with sigmoidal
activations. In networks with K >= 3 sigmoidal hidden units, the transition is
discontinuous: Specialized network configurations co-exist and compete with
states of poor performance even for very large training sets. On the contrary,

  In contrast, there exist embedded graphs where $\Omega(n)$ changes are
necessary to accommodate one inserted edge. We provide a matching lower bound
of $\Omega(\log n)$ local changes, and although our upper bound is worst-case,
our lower bound hold in the amortized case as well.
  Our proof is based on BC trees and SPQR trees, and we develop
\emph{pre-split} variants of these for general graphs, based on a novel biased
heavy-path decomposition, where the structural changes corresponding to edge
insertions and deletions in the underlying graph consist of at most $O(\log n)$
basic operations of a particularly simple form.
  As a secondary result, we show how to maintain the pre-split trees under edge

a valuable asset for the maintenance and evolution of mobile apps. To fully
make use of these assets, it is highly desirable for developers to establish
semantic links between the user reviews and the software artefacts to be

leverages domain-specific constraint information and semi-supervised learning
to group user reviews into multiple fine-grained clusters concerning similar

with a critical temperature $T_c = 50.10(2)$ K and $\gamma = 1.028(12)$ with
$T_c = 49.97(5)$ K are obtained from the modified Arrott plot, whereas $\delta

ferromagnetic phase transition in VI$_3$ is situated close to a three- to

are obtained by scanning the bar codes of individual products at the points of
sale of retail outlets. Many national statistical offices use scanner data to
build consumer price statistics. In this process, as in other statistical

important step in the analysis. Popular methods for conducting such outlier
detection are the quartile method, the Hidiroglou-Berthelot method, the

solely on information about price changes and not on any of the other
covariates (e.g., sales volume or types of retail shops) that are also

abnormal price changes that takes into account an additional covariate, namely,
sales volume. We assume that the variance of the log of the price change is a
smooth function of the sales volume and estimate the function from previously

ecological dynamics. We focus on a gLV model of the gut microbiome, in which
the evolution of the gut microbial state is determined in part by pairwise
inter-species interaction parameters that encode environmentally-mediated
resource competition between microbes. We develop an in silico method that
controls the steady-state outcome of the system by adjusting these interaction
parameters. This approach is confined to a bistable region of the gLV model.
The two steady states of interest are idealized as either a ""healthy"" or
""diseased"" steady state of the gut microbiome. In this method, a dimensionality
reduction technique called steady-state reduction (SSR) is first used to
generate a two-dimensional (2D) gLV model that approximates the
high-dimensional dynamics on the 2D subspace spanned by the two steady states.
Then a bifurcation analysis of the 2D model analytically determines parameter
modifications that drive a disease-prone initial condition to the healthy

parameter modifications of the original high-dimensional model, resulting in a
change of steady-state outcome in the high-dimensional model. This control
method, called SPARC (SSR-guided parameter change), bypasses the computational
challenge of directly determining parameter modifications in the original

Evidence for changing-look AGNs is caused by change of accretion mode,2019-12-09T11:19:03Z,"Hao liu, Qingwen Wu, Bing Lyu, Zhen Yan","The discovery of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs), with
appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines and/or with strong
variation of line-of-sight column density within a few years, challenges the
AGN unification model. We explore the physical mechanisms based on the X-ray
spectral evolution for a sample of 15 CL AGNs. We find that the X-ray photon
index, $\Gamma$, and Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm 2-10
keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$, follow negative and positive correlations when $L_{\rm 2-10
keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$ is lower and higher than a critical value of $\sim 10^{-3}$.
This different X-ray spectral evolution is roughly consistent with the
prediction of the accretion-mode transition (e.g., clumpy cold gas or cold disk
to advection dominated accretion flow, or vice visa). With quasi-simultaneous
X-ray and optical spectrum observations within one year, we find that the CL
AGNs observed with and without broad emission lines stay in the positive and
negative part of the $\Gamma-L_{\rm 2-10 keV}/L_{\rm Edd}$ correlation
respectively. Our result suggest that the change of the accretion mode may be
the physical reason for the CL AGNs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03972v1
Roles for Computing in Social Change,2019-12-10T18:46:42Z,"Rediet Abebe, Solon Barocas, Jon Kleinberg, Karen Levy, Manish Raghavan, David G. Robinson","A recent normative turn in computer science has brought concerns about
fairness, bias, and accountability to the core of the field. Yet recent
scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic
features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of
injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that
computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems
-- roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires
toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles,
through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant
risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic,
helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and
clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly
defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are
understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of
what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when
it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We
offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths
of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming
computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04883v4

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to study cardiac autonomic imbalance in
epileptic seizures. The significance and the prevalence of changes in PPG
morphological parameters have been investigated to find common patterns among
subjects. Alterations in cardiovascular parameters measured by PPG/ECG signals
are used to train a neural network based on LSTM for automatic seizure
detection. Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG), ECG, and PPG signals from 12
different subjects ( 8 males;4 females;age 34.3$\pm$ 13.8) were recorded
including 57 seizures and 101 hours of inter-ictal data. 12 PPG features
significantly changing due to epileptic seizures were extracted and normalized
based on a proposed z-score metric. 7 feature are heart rate variability
related and 5 features hemodynamic related. Results: A consistent pattern of
ictal change was observed for all the features across the subjects/seziures.
The proposed seizure detector is subject independent and works for both
nocturnal and diurnal seizures. With an average of 0.52 false alarms per hour,
positive predictive value of $43\%$ and sensitivity of $92\%$, the new proposed
hemodynamic based seizure detector shows improvement over the the heart rate
variability based detector. Conclusion: The cardiac autonomic imbalance due to
seizure manifests itself in variations of peripheral hemodynamics measured by
PPG signal, suggesting vasoconstriction in limbs. These variations can be used
on a consumer seizure detecting devices with optical sensors for seizure
detection. Significance: The stereotyped pattern is common among all the
subjects which can help understand the mechanism of cardiac autonomic imbalance
induced by epileptic seizures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05083v1
Assessing Practitioner Beliefs about Software Defect Prediction,2019-12-20T20:40:27Z,"N. C. Shrikanth, Tim Menzies","Just because software developers say they believe in ""X"", that does not
necessarily mean that ""X"" is true. As shown here, there exist numerous beliefs
listed in the recent Software Engineering literature which are only supported
by small portions of the available data. Hence we ask what is the source of
this disconnect between beliefs and evidence?. To answer this question we look
for evidence for ten beliefs within 300,000+ changes seen in dozens of
open-source projects. Some of those beliefs had strong support across all the
projects; specifically, ""A commit that involves more added and removed lines is
more bug-prone"" and ""Files with fewer lines contributed by their owners (who
contribute most changes) are bug-prone"". Most of the widely-held beliefs
studied are only sporadically supported in the data; i.e. large effects can
appear in project data and then disappear in subsequent releases. Such sporadic
support explains why developers believe things that were relevant to their
prior work, but not necessarily their current work. Our conclusion will be that
we need to change the nature of the debate with Software Engineering.
Specifically, while it is important to report the effects that hold right now,
it is also important to report on what effects change over time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10093v3
Homeorhesis in Waddington's Landscape by Epigenetic Feedback Regulation,2019-12-27T05:28:39Z,"Yuuki Matsushita, Kunihiko Kaneko","In multicellular organisms, cells differentiate into several distinct types
during early development. Determination of each cellular state, along with the
ratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental course during cell
differentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and
environmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically
depicted this robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of
each cellular state is represented by each valley in the landscape. This
robustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor in a
gene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete
understanding of the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by
branching of valleys that corresponds to the differentiation process. Recent
progress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved
in epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of
slow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between
gene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known
as homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that
combines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a
regulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the
feasibility of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a
slow positive-feedback process from expression to the threshold level is
introduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several fixed-point attractors with
distinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping the
epigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys. This theory provides
a quantitative framework for explaining homeorhesis in development as
postulated by Waddington, based on dynamical-system theory with slow feedback
reinforcement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11994v1

endurance, and scalable non-volatile memory technology which utilizes the large
resistivity contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phases of
chalcogenide materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). In addition to being used as a
standalone memory, there has been a growing interest in integration of PCM
devices on top of the CMOS layer for computation in memory and neuromorphic
computing. The large CMOS overhead for memory controllers is a limiting factor
for this purpose. Transferring functionality like routing, multiplexing, and
logic to the memory layer can substantially reduce the CMOS overhead, making it
possible to integrate 100s of GB of PCM storage on top of a conventional CPU.
In this work, we present computational analysis of a phase change device
concept that can perform toggle operations. The toggle functionality is
achieved using two physical mechanisms: (i) isolation of different read
contacts due to amorphization between different write contact pairs, and (ii)
thermal cross-talk between a molten region and a previously amorphized region.
Phase-change devices with six contacts can be implemented as toggle flip-flops,
multiplexer, or demultiplexer when interfaced with CMOS transistors. Here, we
demonstrate the operation of the device as a toggle flip-flop with 5
transistors, requiring ~50% of the footprint compared to conventional CMOS
alternatives, with the added advantage of non-volatility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00836v1

pose detectors are datasets with labeled 6D poses. With the advent of deep
learning, demand for such datasets is growing continuously. Despite the fact
that some of exist, they are scarce and typically have restricted setups, such
as a single object per sequence, or they focus on specific object types, such
as textureless industrial parts. Besides, two significant components are often
ignored: training using only available 3D models instead of real data and
scalability, i.e. training one method to detect all objects rather than
training one detector per object. Other challenges, such as occlusions,
changing light conditions and changes in object appearance, as well precisely
defined benchmarks are either not present or are scattered among different
datasets. In this paper we present a dataset for 6D pose estimation that covers
the above-mentioned challenges, mainly targeting training from 3D models (both
textured and textureless), scalability, occlusions, and changes in light
conditions and object appearance. The dataset features 33 objects (17 toy, 8
household and 8 industry-relevant objects) over 13 scenes of various
difficulty. We also present a set of benchmarks to test various desired
detector properties, particularly focusing on scalability with respect to the
number of objects and resistance to changing light conditions, occlusions and
clutter. We also set a baseline for the presented benchmarks using a

different Fermi surface topology below and above the band touching point where
spin-degeneracy is not lifted by the spin-orbit coupling. We investigate
thermoelectric and optical response as probes for this Fermi surface topology
change. We show that the chemical potential displays a dimensional crossover
from a three-dimensional to one-dimensional characteristics as the descending
Fermi energy crosses the band touching point. This dimensional crossover is due
to the existence of different Fermi surface topology above and below the band
touching point. We obtain an exact expression of relaxation time due to
short-range scatterer by solving Boltzmann transport equations
self-consistently. The thermoelctric power and figure of merit are
significantly enhanced as the Fermi energy goes below the band touching point
owing to the underlying one-dimensional-like nature of noncentrosymmteric bulk
metals. The value of thermoelectric figure of merit goes beyond two as the
Fermi energy approaches to the van Hove singularity for lower spin-orbit
coupling. Similarly, the studies of the zero-frequency and finite-frequency
optical conductivities in the zero-momentum limit reflect the nature of
topological change of the Fermi surface. The Hall coefficient and optical

  Vehicles at Traffic Diverges with a Bifurcating Lane",2019-04-17T16:52:59Z,"Ruolin Li, Negar Mehr, Roberto Horowitz","Road network junctions, such as merges and diverges, often act as bottlenecks
that initiate and exacerbate congestion. More complex junction configurations
lead to more complex driver behaviors, resulting in aggregate congestion
patterns that are more difficult to predict and mitigate. In this paper, we
discuss diverge configurations where vehicles on some lanes can enter only one
of the downstream roads, but vehicles on other lanes can enter one of several
downstream roads. Counterintuitively, these bifurcating lanes, rather than
relieving congestion (by acting as a versatile resource that can serve either
downstream road as the demand changes), often cause enormous congestion due to
lane changing. We develop an aggregate lane--changing model for this situation
that is expressive enough to model drivers' choices and the resultant
congestion, but simple enough to easily analyze. We use a game-theoretic
framework to model the aggregate lane choice behavior of selfish vehicles as a
Wardrop equilibrium (an aggregate type of Nash equilibrium). We then establish
the existence and uniqueness of this equilibrium. We explain how our model can
be easily calibrated using simulation data or real data, and we present results
showing that our model successfully predicts the aggregate behavior that
emerges from widely-used behavioral lane-changing models. Our model's
expressiveness, ease of calibration, and accuracy may make it a useful tool for
mitigating congestion at these complex diverges.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08358v1
The evolution of polarization in the legislative branch of government,2019-04-20T23:54:51Z,"Xiaoyan Lu, Jianxi Gao, Boleslaw K. Szymanski","The polarization of political opinions among members of the U.S. legislative
chambers measured by their voting records is greater today than it was thirty
years ago. Previous research efforts to find causes of such increase have
suggested diverse contributors, like growth of online media, echo chamber
effects, media biases, or disinformation propagation. Yet, we lack theoretic
tools to understand, quantify, and predict the emergence of high political
polarization among voters and their legislators. Here, we analyze millions of
roll-call votes cast in the U.S. Congress over the past six decades. Our
analysis reveals the critical change of polarization patterns that started at
the end of 1980's. In earlier decades, polarization within each Congress tended
to decrease with time. In contrast, in the recent decades, the polarization has
been likely to grow within each term. To shed light on the reasons for this
change, we introduce here a formal model for competitive dynamics to quantify
the evolution of polarization patterns in the legislative branch of the U.S.
government. Our model represents dynamics of polarization, enabling us to
successfully predict the direction of polarization changes in 28 out of 30 U.S.
Congresses elected in the past six decades. From the evolution of polarization
level as measured by the Rice index, our model extracts a hidden parameter -
polarization utility which determines the convergence point of the polarization
evolution. The increase in the polarization utility implied by the model
strongly correlates with two current trends: growing polarization of voters and
increasing influence of election campaign funders. Two largest peaks of the
model's polarization utility correlate with significant political or
legislative changes happening at the same time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10317v1

be an indicator of brain activity both in normal and in pathological
conditions, PA imaging of the brain has mainly focused on small animal models
with lissencephalic brains. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to
investigate the usefulness of multispectral PA imaging in assessing sO2 in a
gyrencephalic brain. To this end, we continuously imaged a porcine brain as
part of an open neurosurgical intervention with a handheld PA and ultrasonic
(US) imaging system in vivo. Throughout the experiment, we varied respiratory
oxygen and continuously measured arterial blood gases. The arterial blood
oxygenation (SaO2) values derived by the blood gas analyzer were used as a
reference to compare the performance of linear spectral unmixing algorithms in
this scenario. According to our experiment, PA imaging can be used to monitor
sO2 in the porcine cerebral cortex. While linear spectral unmixing algorithms
are well-suited for detecting changes in oxygenation, there are limits with
respect to the accurate quantification of sO2, especially in depth. Overall, we
conclude that multispectral PA imaging can potentially be a valuable tool for
change detection of sO2 in the cerebral cortex of a gyrencephalic brain. The

Photo Switching of Protein Dynamical Collectivity,2019-06-03T15:50:18Z,"M. Xu, D. K. George, R. Jimenez, A. G. Markelz","We examine changes in the picosecond structural dynamics with irreversible
photobleaching of red fluorescent proteins mCherry, mOrange2 and TagRFP-T.
Measurements of the protein dynamical transition using terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy show in all cases an increase in the turn-on temperature in the
bleached state. The result is surprising given that there is little change in
the protein surface, and thus the solvent dynamics held responsible for the
transition should not change. A spectral analysis of the measurements guided by
quasiharmonic calculations of the protein absorbance reveals that indeed the
solvent dynamical turn-on temperature is independent of the thermal stability
and photostate however the protein dynamical turn-on temperature shifts to
higher temperatures. This is the first demonstration of switching the protein
dynamical turn-on temperature with protein functional state. The observed shift
in protein dynamical turn-on temperature relative to the solvent indicates an
increase in the required mobile waters necessary for the protein picosecond
motions: that is these motions are more collective. Melting-point measurements
reveal that the photobleached state is more thermally stable and structural
analysis of related RFPs shows that there is an increase in internal water
channels as well as a more uniform atomic root mean squared displacement. These
observations are consistent with previous suggestions that water channels form
with extended light excitation providing O2 access to the chromophore and
subsequent fluorescence loss. We report that these same channels increase
internal coupling enhancing thermal stability and collectivity of the
picosecond protein motions. The terahertz spectroscopic characterization of the
protein and solvent dynamical onsets can be applied generally to measure
changes in collectivity of protein motions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00893v1
Metrics Towards Measuring Cyber Agility,2019-06-12T21:50:45Z,"Jose David Mireles, Eric Ficke, Jin-Hee Cho, Patrick Hurley, Shouhuai Xu","In cyberspace, evolutionary strategies are commonly used by both attackers
and defenders. For example, an attacker's strategy often changes over the
course of time, as new vulnerabilities are discovered and/or mitigated.
Similarly, a defender's strategy changes over time. These changes may or may
not be in direct response to a change in the opponent's strategy. In any case,
it is important to have a set of quantitative metrics to characterize and
understand the effectiveness of attackers' and defenders' evolutionary
strategies, which reflect their {\em cyber agility}. Despite its clear
importance, few systematic metrics have been developed to quantify the cyber
agility of attackers and defenders. In this paper, we propose the first metric
framework for measuring cyber agility in terms of the effectiveness of the
dynamic evolution of cyber attacks and defenses. The proposed framework is
generic and applicable to transform any relevant, quantitative, and/or
conventional static security metrics (e.g., false positives and false
negatives) into dynamic metrics to capture dynamics of system behaviors. In

the updated star formation properties and radio continuum scale heights, scale
lengths, and diameters, measured in Krause et al. (2018). We find a newly

correction should be applied to SFR calibrations when used in edge-on galaxies,
due to attenuation by dust. The updated SFR values also show newly discovered

which we define as the total effect of the intervention. The type of
mathematical models that we will consider are discrete dynamical systems which
include the widely used Boolean networks and their generalizations. The
potential interventions can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can

on the canalizing properties of regulatory functions. Using this polynomial
normal form, we give a set of formulas for counting the maximum number of
transitions that will change in the state space upon an edge deletion in the
wiring diagram. These formulas rely on the canalizing structure of the target
function since the number of changed transitions depends on the canalizing

from intrinsic changes in accretion power rather than variable obscuration. The
variability is continuous and apparently stochastic, disfavoring an origin as a
discrete event such as a tidal disruption flare or microlensing event. It is
coordinated on day timescales with blue leading red, consistent with
reprocessing powering the entire optical SED. We show that this process cannot

determining differences between one series of images to another can be
subjective or fail to detect very small differences. We propose the use of
quantization errors obtained from Self Organizing Maps for image content
analysis. We tested this technique with MRI images to which we progressively
added synthetic lesions. We have used a global approach that considers changes
on the entire image as opposed to changes in segmented lesion regions only. We
claim that this approach does not suffer from the limitations imposed by
segmentation, which may compromise the results. Results show quantization
errors increased with the increase in lesions on the images. The results are
also consistent with previous studies using alternative approaches. We then
compared the detectability ability of our method to that of human novice
observers having to detect very small local differences in random-dot images.
The quantization errors of the SOM outputs compared with correct positive
rates, after subtraction of false positive rates (guess rates), increased
noticeably and consistently with small increases in local dot size that were
not detectable by humans. We conclude that our method detects very small

mixture, we develop an efficient technique to instantly learn (capture) the

"Slowing-down reduction and Possible Reversal Trend of Tropospheric NO2
  over China during 2016 to 2019",2019-07-15T14:40:09Z,"Rui Li, Haixu Bo, Yu Wang","Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China at national level has been kept
reducing since 2011 as seen from both satellite observations, ground-based
measurements and bottom-up emission inventory (Liu et al., 2016; Irie et al.,
2016; Krotkov et al., 2016; Foy et al., 2016; Liu et al 2017). These studies
used data before 2015-2016. After 2016, however, a significant slowing-down of
the reduction trend and/or even a reversal trend were found in numerous
provinces, particularly in those with heavy NO2 level, based on satellite
observations. Error analysis on satellite data excluded cloud contamination,
instrument anomalies from the main reasons of this change. Ground-based
measurements show strong positive correlations with satellite observations and
similar patterns of year-to-year changes of NO2 in 2018 and 2019 winter time.
The temporal variations of Satellite NO2 over China are believed largely
determined by surface emission from power plant and transportation. The reason
for the recent change from emission perspective cannot be traced down since the
national emission inventory was not updated since 2015. We therefore call on
immediate attentions from both scientist community and policy makers to this
phenomenon. Further efforts should be made to understand the reasons causing
this change and to make associated air pollution controlling actions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06525v1

transmitted light. The most typical example is the natural optical activity,
which has the symmetry property of changing sign after space inversion but
being invariant to time inversion. Faraday rotation exhibits the opposite: it
is invariant to space inversion but changes sign after time reversal. Here, we
demonstrate that in a magnetoelectric material, another type of polarization
rotation is possible. This effect is investigated in magnetoelectric
YbAl3(BO3)4 under the viewpoint of time and space inversion symmetry arguments.
We observe the sign change of the rotation sense under either time or space
reversal. This investigation proves that the polarization rotation in
YbAl3(BO3)4 must be classified as gyrotropic birefringence, which has been
discussed within the idea of time-reversal breaking in underdoped cuprates. The
diagonal terms in the magnetoelectric susceptibility are responsible for the
observed signal of gyrotropic birefringence. Further analysis of the
experimental spectra reveals a substantial contribution of the natural optical
activity to the polarization rotation. We also demonstrate that the observed
activity originates from the magnetoelectric susceptibility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06899v1

the atmosphere coupled to moisture dynamics with phase changes for warm clouds,
where water is present in the form of water vapor and in the liquid state as
cloud water and rain water. This moisture model contains closures for the phase
changes condensation and evaporation, as well as the processes of
autoconversion of cloud water into rainwater and the collection of cloud water
by the falling rain droplets. It has been used by Klein and Majda in \cite{KM}
and corresponds to a basic form of the bulk microphysics closure in the spirit
of Kessler \cite{Ke} and Grabowski and Smolarkiewicz \cite{GS}. The moisture
balances are strongly coupled to the thermodynamic equation via the latent heat
associated to the phase changes. In \cite{HKLT} we assumed the velocity field
to be given and proved rigorously the global existence and uniqueness of
uniformly bounded solutions of the moisture balances coupled to the
thermodynamic equation. In this paper we present the solvability of a full
moist atmospheric flow model, where the moisture model is coupled to the
primitive equations of atmospherical dynamics governing the velocity field. For
the derivation of a priori estimates for the velocity field we thereby use the

Prediction of Highway Lane Changes Based on Prototype Trajectories,2019-07-25T17:18:53Z,"David Augustin, Marius Hofmann, Ulrich Konigorski","The vision of automated driving is to increase both road safety and
efficiency, while offering passengers a convenient travel experience. This
requires that autonomous systems correctly estimate the current traffic scene
and its likely evolution. In highway scenarios early recognition of cut-in
maneuvers is essential for risk-aware maneuver planning. In this paper, a
statistical approach is proposed, which advantageously utilizes a set of
prototypical lane change trajectories to realize both early maneuver detection
and uncertainty-aware trajectory prediction for traffic participants.
Generation of prototype trajectories from real traffic data is accomplished by
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. During clustering, the alignment of the
cluster prototypes to each other is optimized and the cohesion of the resulting
prototype is limited when two clusters merge. In the prediction stage, the
similarity of observed vehicle motion and typical lane change patterns in the
data base is evaluated to construct a set of significant features for maneuver
classification via Boosted Decision Trees. The future trajectory is predicted
combining typical lane change realizations in a mixture model. B-splines based
trajectory adaptations guarantee continuity during transition from actually
observed to predicted vehicle states. Quantitative evaluation results
demonstrate the proposed concept's improved performance for both maneuver and
trajectory prediction compared to a previously implemented reference approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11208v1
Discriminability Tests for Visualization Effectiveness and Scalability,2019-07-26T01:57:36Z,"Rafael Veras, Christopher Collins","The scalability of a particular visualization approach is limited by the
ability for people to discern differences between plots made with different
datasets. Ideally, when the data changes, the visualization changes in
perceptible ways. This relation breaks down when there is a mismatch between
the encoding and the character of the dataset being viewed. Unfortunately,
visualizations are often designed and evaluated without fully exploring how
they will respond to a wide variety of datasets. We explore the use of an image
similarity measure, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), for
testing the discriminability of a data visualization across a variety of
datasets. MS-SSIM is able to capture the similarity of two visualizations
across multiple scales, including low level granular changes and high level
patterns. Significant data changes that are not captured by the MS-SSIM
indicate visualizations of low discriminability and effectiveness. The
measure's utility is demonstrated with two empirical studies. In the first, we
compare human similarity judgments and MS-SSIM scores for a collection of
scatterplots. In the second, we compute the discriminability values for a set
of basic visualizations and compare them with empirical measurements of
effectiveness. In both cases, the analyses show that the computational measure
is able to approximate empirical results. Our approach can be used to rank
competing encodings on their discriminability and to aid in selecting
visualizations for a particular type of data distribution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11358v1
Ice Model Calibration Using Semi-continuous Spatial Data,2019-07-31T15:30:36Z,"Won Chang, Bledar A. Konomi, Georgios Karagiannis, Yawen Guan, Murali Haran","Rapid changes in Earth's cryosphere caused by human activity can lead to
significant environmental impacts. Computer models provide a useful tool for
understanding the behavior and projecting the future of Arctic and Antarctic
ice sheets. However, these models are typically subject to large parametric
uncertainties due to poorly constrained model input parameters that govern the
behavior of simulated ice sheets. Computer model calibration provides a formal
statistical framework to infer parameters using observational data, and to
quantify the uncertainty in projections due to the uncertainty in these
parameters. Calibration of ice sheet models is often challenging because the
relevant model output and observational data take the form of semi-continuous
spatial data, with a point mass at zero and a right-skewed continuous
distribution for positive values. Current calibration approaches cannot handle
such data. Here we introduce a hierarchical latent variable model that handles
binary spatial patterns and positive continuous spatial patterns as separate
components. To overcome challenges due to high-dimensionality we use
likelihood-based generalized principal component analysis to impose
low-dimensional structures on the latent variables for spatial dependence. We
apply our methodology to calibrate a physical model for the Antarctic ice sheet

densities. A common strategy to finetune the properties of phase change memory
materials, reaching reasonable thermal stability in optical data storage,
relies on mixing precise amounts of different dopants, resulting often in
quaternary or even more complicated compounds. Here we show how the simplest
material imaginable, a single element (in this case, antimony), can become a
valid alternative when confined in extremely small volumes. This compositional
simplification eliminates problems related to unwanted deviations from the

stabilization time. We first present a construction showing this bound in the
adversarial sequential model, and then we show how to extend the construction
to establish the same bound in the benevolent sequential model, as well as in
any reasonable concurrent model. Furthermore, we show that the stabilization
time of our construction remains exponential even for very strict switching
conditions, namely, if a node only changes color when almost all (i.e., any

the electric dipole of the water molecules at the electrode surfaces, leading
to dipolar switching of the charge-injection barrier height. As a result of the
switching, current-voltage curves of two-terminal Au-rubrene-Au devices change
from symmetric to asymmetric, showing diode-like rectification and reversible
switching of the diode polarity. The device shows the highest current switching

where events occur at abnormally high rate. In this paper we revisit
Kleinberg's seminal work, where bursts are discovered by using exponential
distribution with a varying rate parameter: the regions where it is more
advantageous to set the rate higher are deemed bursty. The model depends on two
parameters, the initial rate and the change rate. The initial rate, that is,
the rate that is used when there are no burstiness was set to the average rate
over the whole sequence. The change rate is provided by the user.
  We argue that these choices are suboptimal: it leads to worse likelihood, and
may lead to missing some existing bursts. We propose an alternative problem
setting, where the model parameters are selected by optimizing the likelihood
of the model. While this tweak is trivial from the problem definition point of
view, this changes the optimization problem greatly. To solve the problem in
practice, we propose efficient ($1 + \epsilon$) approximation schemes. Finally,
we demonstrate empirically that with this setting we are able to discover

The second pathway happens due to feedback mechanisms between market
performance and the use of certain (decoupled) trading strategies. The third

time while others are removed. We propose to address the problem of dynamic
text classification by replacing the traditional, fixed-size output layer with
a learned, semantically meaningful metric space. Here the distances between
textual inputs are optimized to perform nearest-neighbor classification across
overlapping label sets. Changing the label set does not involve removing
parameters, but rather simply adding or removing support points in the metric
space. Then the learned metric can be fine-tuned with only a few additional
training examples. We demonstrate that this simple strategy is robust to
changes in the label space. Furthermore, our results show that learning a

which grows approximately with the second power of the disorder strength.
Moreover, we observe experimentally a change of oscillation frequency which
deviates from the expected behavior of a damped harmonic oscillator on a
percent level. While this behavior is qualitatively expected from the
theoretical models used, quantitatively the experimental observations show a
significantly stronger effect than predicted by theory. Furthermore, while the
frequency shift seems to scale differently with interaction strength in the BEC

It was found that for the computational domain without CHT, the treatment of
constant temperature BC with nucleate spots is quite easier to produce film

significant reduction in mean and radial diffusivity, but a significant
increase in fractional anisotropy compared to the young cohort. We observed a

Josephson junctions of Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals,2019-09-26T18:00:08Z,"Kirill Kulikov, Debabrata Sinha, Yu. M. Shukrinov, K. Sengupta","We study a Josephson junction involving a Weyl and a multi-Weyl semimetal
separated by a barrier region of width $d$ created by putting a gate voltage
$U_0$ over the Weyl semimetal. The topological winding number of such a
junction changes across the barrier. We show that $I_c R_N$ for such junctions,
where $I_c$ is the critical current and $R_N$ the normal state resistance, in
the thin barrier limit, has a universal value independent of the barrier
potential. We provide an analytical expression of the Andreev bound states and
use it to demonstrate that the universal value of $I_c R_N$ is a consequence of
change in topological winding number across the junction. We also study AC
Josephson effect in such a junction in the presence of an external microwave
radiation, chart out its current-voltage characteristics, and show that the
change in the winding number across the junction shapes the properties of its
Shapiro steps. We discuss the effect of increasing barrier thickness $d$ on the
above-mentioned properties and chart out experiments which may test our theory.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12308v2
Rethinking Text Attribute Transfer: A Lexical Analysis,2019-09-26T18:59:53Z,"Yao Fu, Hao Zhou, Jiaze Chen, Lei Li","Text attribute transfer is modifying certain linguistic attributes (e.g.
sentiment, style, authorship, etc.) of a sentence and transforming them from
one type to another. In this paper, we aim to analyze and interpret what is
changed during the transfer process. We start from the observation that in many
existing models and datasets, certain words within a sentence play important
roles in determining the sentence attribute class. These words are referred to
as \textit{the Pivot Words}. Based on these pivot words, we propose a lexical
analysis framework, \textit{the Pivot Analysis}, to quantitatively analyze the
effects of these words in text attribute classification and transfer. We apply
this framework to existing datasets and models and show that: (1) the pivot
words are strong features for the classification of sentence attributes; (2) to
change the attribute of a sentence, many datasets only requires to change
certain pivot words; (3) consequently, many transfer models only perform the
lexical-level modification, while leaving higher-level sentence structures
unchanged. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of linguistic attribute
transfer and further identifies the future requirements and challenges of this
task\footnote{Our code can be found at

liquids. Photoionization is a possibility, but the effect is difficult to
differentiate from other contributions. In this work, we model radiation from
the streamer head, causing photoionization when absorbed in the liquid. We find
that photoionization is local in space ({\mu}m-scale). The radiation absorption
cross section is modeled considering that the ionization potential (IP) is
dependent on the electric field. The result is a steep increase in the
ionization rate when the electric field reduces the IP below the energy of the
first electronically excited state, which is interpreted as a possible
mechanism for changing from slow to fast streamers. By combining a simulation
model for slow streamers based on the avalanche mechanism with a change to fast
mode based on a photoionization threshold for the electric field, we
demonstrate how the conductivity of the streamer channel can be important for
switching between slow and fast streamer propagation modes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12694v2

extended periods of time by capturing these patterns and exploiting this
knowledge to make informed decisions. Our approach incrementally estimates a
model of the traversability changes from robot's observations and uses a
probabilistic graphical model to make predictions at currently unobserved
locations. In the belief space defined by the predictions, we plan paths that
trade off the risk to encounter obstacles and the information gain of visiting
unknown locations. We implemented our approach and tested it in different

spatial sharing of information between neighborhoods while modeling trends in
crime counts over time. We apply our methodology to estimate changes in crime

one can obtain any conditional quantile of the target distribution, not just

coupling. It is found that the point-particle couplings all must be
renormalized with respect to a radial cut-off near the origin, and it is an
invariant of the flow of the flavour-changing coupling that is directly related
to particle-changing cross-sections. At the same time, we find an interesting
dependence of those cross-sections on the ratio k_out/k_in of the outgoing and
incoming momenta, which can lead to a 1/k_in enhancement in certain regimes. We
further connect this model to the case of a single-particle non-self-adjoint

identify the most influential fact for a predicted link and evaluate the

approximating the change in the embeddings when the knowledge graph changes. To
avoid the combinatorial search over all possible facts, we train a network to
decode embeddings to their corresponding graph components, allowing the use of
gradient-based optimization to identify the adversarial modification. We use

changes that not only recover the original level of function (locomotion) as
before, but can in fact surpass the original level of performance (speed). This
suggests that shape change, instead of control readaptation, may be a better
method to recover function after damage in some cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09264v1
Deep density ratio estimation for change point detection,2019-05-23T19:04:56Z,"Haidar Khan, Lara Marcuse, B√ºlent Yener","In this work, we propose new objective functions to train deep neural network
based density ratio estimators and apply it to a change point detection
problem. Existing methods use linear combinations of kernels to approximate the
density ratio function by solving a convex constrained minimization problem.
Approximating the density ratio function using a deep neural network requires
defining a suitable objective function to optimize. We formulate and compare
objective functions that can be minimized using gradient descent and show that
the network can effectively learn to approximate the density ratio function.
Using our deep density ratio estimation objective function results in better
performance on a seizure detection task than other (kernel and neural network
based) density ratio estimation methods and other window-based change point
detection algorithms. We also show that the method can still support other
neural network architectures, such as convolutional networks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09876v1
Continual Reinforcement Learning in 3D Non-stationary Environments,2019-05-24T09:38:42Z,"Vincenzo Lomonaco, Karan Desai, Eugenio Culurciello, Davide Maltoni","High-dimensional always-changing environments constitute a hard challenge for
current reinforcement learning techniques. Artificial agents, nowadays, are
often trained off-line in very static and controlled conditions in simulation

often non-stationary and subject to unpredictable, frequent changes. In this
paper we propose and openly release CRLMaze, a new benchmark for learning
continually through reinforcement in a complex 3D non-stationary task based on

Enhancing Adversarial Defense by k-Winners-Take-All,2019-05-25T03:36:40Z,"Chang Xiao, Peilin Zhong, Changxi Zheng","We propose a simple change to existing neural network structures for better
defending against gradient-based adversarial attacks. Instead of using popular
activation functions (such as ReLU), we advocate the use of k-Winners-Take-All
(k-WTA) activation, a C0 discontinuous function that purposely invalidates the
neural network model's gradient at densely distributed input data points. The
proposed k-WTA activation can be readily used in nearly all existing networks
and training methods with no significant overhead. Our proposal is
theoretically rationalized. We analyze why the discontinuities in k-WTA
networks can largely prevent gradient-based search of adversarial examples and
why they at the same time remain innocuous to the network training. This
understanding is also empirically backed. We test k-WTA activation on various
network structures optimized by a training method, be it adversarial training
or not. In all cases, the robustness of k-WTA networks outperforms that of
traditional networks under white-box attacks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10510v3
Large Scale Markov Decision Processes with Changing Rewards,2019-05-25T18:26:49Z,"Adrian Rivera Cardoso, He Wang, Huan Xu","We consider Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the rewards are unknown

where $S$ is the state space, $A$ is the action space, $\tau$ is the mixing
time of the MDP, and $T$ is the number of periods. The algorithm's
computational complexity is polynomial in $|S|$ and $|A|$ per period. We then
consider a setting often encountered in practice, where the state space of the
MDP is too large to allow for exact solutions. By approximating the
state-action occupancy measures with a linear architecture of dimension
$d\ll|S|$, we propose a modified algorithm with computational complexity

"Automatic Realistic Music Video Generation from Segments of Youtube
  Videos",2019-05-29T06:57:09Z,"Sarah Gross, Xingxing Wei, Jun Zhu","A Music Video (MV) is a video aiming at visually illustrating or extending
the meaning of its background music. This paper proposes a novel method to
automatically generate, from an input music track, a music video made of
segments of Youtube music videos which would fit this music. The system
analyzes the input music to find its genre (pop, rock, ...) and finds segmented
MVs with the same genre in the database. Then, a K-Means clustering is done to
group video segments by color histogram, meaning segments of MVs having the
same global distribution of colors. A few clusters are randomly selected, then
are assembled around music boundaries, which are moments where a significant
change in the music occurs (for instance, transitioning from verse to chorus).
This way, when the music changes, the video color mood changes as well. This
work aims at generating high-quality realistic MVs, which could be mistaken for
man-made MVs. By asking users to identify, in a batch of music videos
containing professional MVs, amateur-made MVs and generated MVs by our
algorithm, we show that our algorithm gives satisfying results, as 45% of
generated videos are mistaken for professional MVs and 21.6% are mistaken for

The problem we would like to investigate is what associated beneficial
properties that macro actions may possess. In this paper, we unveil the
properties of reusability and transferability of macro actions. The first
property, reusability, means that a macro action generated along with one RL

  Polyethylene -- A molecular Dynamics study",2019-08-12T19:14:19Z,"Rajmohan Muthaiah, Jivtesh Garg","We analyze, through molecular dynamics simulations, the temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity (k) of chain-oriented amorphous
polyethylene (PE). We find that at increasing levels of orientation, the
temperature corresponding to a peak k progressively decreases. Un-oriented PE
exhibits the peak k at 350 K, while aligned PE under an applied strain of 400%
shows a maximum at 100 K. This transition of peak k to lower temperatures with
increasing alignment is explained in terms of a crossover from disorder to
anharmonicity dominated phonon transport in aligned polymers. Evidence for this
crossover is achieved by manipulating the disorder in the polymer structure and
studying the resulting change in temperature corresponding to peak k. Disorder
is modified through a change in the dihedral parameters of the potential
function, allowing a change in the relative fraction of trans and gauche
transformations. The results shed light on the underlying thermal transport
processes in aligned polymers and hold importance for low temperature
applications of polymer materials in thermal management technologies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04341v1

Changepoint in Linear Relations,2019-08-28T10:27:48Z,Michal Pe≈°ta,"Linear relations, containing measurement errors in input and output data, are

spaced time series is a special case of the investigated framework. The
designed changepoint tests are shown to be consistent and involve neither
nuisance parameters nor tuning constants, which makes the testing procedures
effortlessly applicable. A changepoint estimator is also introduced and its
consistency is proved. A boundary issue is avoided, meaning that the
changepoint can be detected when being close to the extremities of the
observation regime. As a theoretical basis for the developed methods, a weak

energy variations due to infinitesimal spin rotations around a given reference

increasing interatomic distances, corresponding to a sign change of the nearest
neighbor exchange interaction. This sign change cannot easily be understood
from a standard superexchange mechanism. Furthermore, the exchange interaction
strongly depends on the corresponding reference state. This ""non-Heisenberg""
behavior increases with increasing volume and is also confirmed through
non-collinear DFT calculations. An orbital- and energy-resolved decomposition
of the exchange coupling suggests that an increased partial occupancy of $e_g$
orbitals near the Fermi level is crucial both for the sign change and the
non-Heisenberg behavior of the nearest neighbor interaction. Furthermore, even

centers enhances the overall performance of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and
decreases the operational costs for mobile network operators. Maintaining an
optimal placement of VNFs under changing load requires a dynamic
reconfiguration that includes adding or removing VNF instances, changing the
resource allocation of VNFs, and re-routing corresponding service flows.
However, such reconfiguration may lead to notable service disruptions and
impose additional overhead on the VNF infrastructure, especially when
reconfiguration entails state or VNF migration. On the other hand, not changing
the existing placement may lead to high operational costs. In this paper, we
investigate the trade-off between the reconfiguration of SFCs and the
optimality of the resulting placement and service flow (re)routing. We model
different reconfiguration costs related to the migration of stateful VNFs and
solve a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize both the total cost of
the VNF placement and the reconfiguration cost necessary for repairing a
suboptimal placement. Numerical results show that a small number of
reconfiguration operations can significantly reduce the operational cost of the
VNF infrastructure; however, too much reconfiguration may not pay off should
heavy costs be involved.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01881v1

different cases are considered. In the case when this mean is uniform (which

exponential attractors. In the case where the mean is not uniform (which

rate is generated by the Bernoulli process), the tempered random attractor is

collisionless systems, in which the quantum dynamics of multi-level,
laser-driven particles with spontaneous emission can be described with the
optical Bloch equations (OBEs), particle velocities in sufficiently collisional
systems change on timescales comparable to those of the laser-induced,
quantum-state dynamics. These transient velocity changes can cause the
time-averaged velocity dependence of the quantum state to differ from the OBE

ultracold neutral plasma. Important phenomena described by the simulation
include suppression of electromagnetically induced transparencies through rapid
velocity changing collisions and thermalization between cooled and un-cooled

Topology change of levels sets in Morse theory,2019-10-11T16:39:51Z,"Andreas Knauf, Nikolay Martynchuk","Classical Morse theory proceeds by considering sublevel sets $f^{-1}(-\infty,
a]$ of a Morse function $f: M \to R$, where $M$ is a smooth finite-dimensional
manifold. In this paper, we study the topology of the level sets $f^{-1}(a)$
and give conditions under which the topology of $f^{-1}(a)$ changes when
passing a critical value. We show that for a general class of functions, which
includes all exhaustive Morse function, the topology of a regular level
$f^{-1}(a)$ always changes when passing a single critical point, unless the
index of the critical point is half the dimension of the manifold $M$. When $f$
is a natural Hamiltonian on a cotangent bundle, we obtain more precise results
in terms of the topology of the configuration space. (Counter-)examples and

new class of topological insulators. Second-order topological insulators are
materials with gapped bulk and surfaces, but with topologically protected
gapless states at the intersection of two surfaces. These gapless states are
called hinge states. In this paper, we give a general proof that any insulators
with inversion symmetry and gapped surface in class A always have hinge states
when the $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ topological index $\mu_{1}$ is $\mu_{1}=2$. We
consider a three-dimensional insulator whose boundary conditions along two
directions change by changing the hopping amplitudes across the boundaries. We
study behaviors of gapless states through continuously changing boundary
conditions along the two directions, and reveal that the behaviors of gapless
states result from the $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ strong topological index. From this
discussion, we show that gapless states inevitably appear at the hinge of a
three-dimensional insulator with gapped surfaces when the strong topological
index is $\mathbb{Z}_{4}=2$ and the weak topological indices are
$\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}=0$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05938v3

contextual cues are provided as input along with base features that are

historical training data to identify contextual clusters either through feature
clustering, or hand-crafting additional features to describe a context. While
offline training enjoys the privilege of learning reliable models based on
already-defined contextual features, online training for streaming data may be
more challenging -- the data is streamed through time, and the underlying
context during a data generation process may change. Furthermore, the problem
is exacerbated when the number of possible context is not known. In this study,
we propose an online-learning algorithm involving the use of a neural
network-based autoencoder to identify contextual changes during training, then
compares the currently-inferred context to a knowledge base of learned contexts

automatically discovered contexts which demonstrates quicker learning

rate of convergence of the MDL (Minimum Description Length) learning algorithm

a linear lattice with velocity +1 or -1 in the one-dimensional model. The
probability of the velocity of a particle at the next step is determined by the
number difference of the right- and left- moving particles at the present
lattice site and its nearest-neighboring sites. A solitary wave appears also in
our model similarly to previous models. In some parameter range, the moving
direction of the solitary wave sometimes changes rather suddenly, which is like
the sudden change of moving direction of a flock of birds. We study the average
reversal time of traveling direction numerically and compare the results with a

considered that the degradation and shock process are mutually dependent. In
fact, each arriving shock accelerates the degradation process by adding abrupt
additional damages to the degradation path and changing the degradation rate

walks on dynamic connected graphs for which the stationary distribution does
not change over time, we show that their behaviour is in a certain sense
similar to static graphs. For example, we show that the mixing and hitting
times of any sequence of $d$-regular connected graphs is $O(n^2)$, generalising
a well-known result for static graphs. We also provide refined bounds depending
on the isoperimetric dimension of the graph, matching again known results for
static graphs. Finally, we investigate properties of random walks on dynamic

convergence to the target lane, optimality, safety in lane-change maneuver and
low computational complexity. Later, based on this path planner, a two-point

this two-point steering path planner possesses the advantage--steering radius
of the planned trajectory is smaller than the intrinsic radius of reference

viscous effects lead to a sign change in the magnon chemical potential, which

transport experiments. This sign change is observable when the
injector-detector distance becomes comparable to the momentum-relaxation

consider the quasiconservation laws for momentum and spin in a magnon fluid.
The resulting equations are solved for nonlocal spin transport devices in which

Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation Using Dilated-Convolutions,2019-03-18T08:29:32Z,"Zhaokang Chen, Bertram E. Shi","Appearance-based gaze estimation has attracted more and more attention
because of its wide range of applications. The use of deep convolutional neural

changes in eye appearance. We argue that current architectures for gaze
estimation may not be able to capture such small changes, as they apply
multiple pooling layers or other downsampling layers so that the spatial
resolution of the high-level layers is reduced significantly. To evaluate
whether the use of features extracted at high resolution can benefit gaze
estimation, we adopt dilated-convolutions to extract high-level features
without reducing spatial resolution. In cross-subject experiments on the
Columbia Gaze dataset for eye contact detection and the MPIIGaze dataset for 3D
gaze vector regression, the resulting Dilated-Nets achieve significant (up to

external fields, the magnetization follows the changing eigenmodes
adiabatically. This results in echo amplitudes that show regular modulations
with time. Faster field changes can induce transitions between the eigenmodes.
Such non-adiabatic behavior occurs preferentially at particular offsets of the
Larmor frequency from the RF frequency where the eigenmodes become nearly
degenerate. We introduce the instantaneous adiabaticity parameter ${\cal A}(t)$
that accurately predicts the crossover from the adiabatic to the non-adiabatic

determined solely by the properties of a single refocusing cycle under static

invar alloy exhibits changes in the core levels below 20 K temperature that
strongly depend on the core level. Such core level dependent changes with

this slice knot can be taken to be the unknot. In this paper we study the

knot in a homology sphere is nullhomotopic in a smooth homology ball if and
only if that knot is smoothly concordant to a knot which is homotopic to a
smoothly slice knot. As a consequence, we prove that the equivalence relation
on knots in homology spheres given by cobounding immersed annuli in a homology

Axonal Conduction Velocity Impacts Neuronal Network Oscillations,2019-03-22T18:38:12Z,"Vladimir A. Ivanov, Ioannis E. Polykretis, Konstantinos P. Michmizos","Increasing experimental evidence suggests that axonal action potential
conduction velocity is a highly adaptive parameter in the adult central nervous

plausible neuronal networks with different conduction velocity distributions.
Changes of 1-2 (ms) in network mean signal transmission time resulted in
substantial network oscillation frequency changes ranging in 0-120 (Hz). Our

"Temporal changes in stimulus perception improve bio-inspired source
  seeking",2019-03-25T12:53:18Z,"A. Peque√±o-Zurro, D. Shaikh, I. Ra√±√≥","Braitenberg vehicles are well known qualitative models of sensor driven
animal source seeking (biological taxes) that locally navigate a stimulus
function. These models ultimately depend on the perceived stimulus values,
while there is biological evidence that animals also use the temporal changes
in the stimulus as information source for taxis behaviour. The time evolution
of the stimulus values depends on the agent's (animal or robot) velocity, while
simultaneously the velocity is typically the variable to control. This circular
dependency appears, for instance, when using optical flow to control the motion
of a robot, and it is solved by fixing the forward speed while controlling only
the steering rate. This paper presents a new mathematical model of a
bio-inspired source seeking controller that includes the rate of change of the
stimulus in the velocity control mechanism. The above mentioned circular
dependency results in a closed-loop model represented by a set of
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which can be converted to non-linear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under some assumptions. Theoretical
results of the model analysis show that including a term dependent on the
temporal evolution of the stimulus improves the behaviour of the closed-loop
system compared to simply using the stimulus values. We illustrate the
theoretical results through a set of simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10279v1

solve such dynamic problem based on a new environment change detection strategy

approach has been developed not just to obtain the optimal solution, but also
to have a capability to detect the environment changes. Thereby, DynamicMOPSO

into a set of reference spectral signatures corresponding to the materials
present in the observed scene and their relative proportions in every pixel.
While a linear mixing model was used for a long time, the complex nature of the
physical mixing processes, led to shift the community's attention towards
nonlinear models and algorithms accounting for the variability of the
endmembers. Such intra class variations are due to local changes in the
physico-chemical composition of the materials, and to illumination changes. In
the physical remote sensing community, a popular model accounting for
illumination variability is the radiative transfer model proposed by Hapke. It
is however too complex to be directly used in hyperspectral unmixing in a
tractable way. Instead, the Extended Linear Mixing Model (ELMM) allows to
easily unmix hyperspectral data accounting for changing illumination
conditions. In this letter, we show that the ELMM can be obtained from the
Hapke model by successive simplifiying physical assumptions, thus theoretically
confirming its relevance to handle illumination induced variability in the

Quantum gravity on a torus,2019-11-30T17:12:19Z,Jakub Gizbert-Studnicki,"Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a non-perturbative lattice approach

spatial topology of the 3-sphere. It was shown that CDT has rich phase
structure, including the semiclassical phase consistent with Einstein's general
relativity. Some of the phase transitions were found to be second (or higher)
order which makes a possibility of taking continuum limit viable. Here we
present new results of changing the spatial topology to that of the 3-torus. We
argue that the topology change does not change the phase structure nor the

Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Policies,2019-11-28T07:23:37Z,"Yixiang Wang, Feng Wu","We propose a novel approach to address one aspect of the non-stationarity
problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL), where the other agents may
alter their policies due to environment changes during execution. This violates
the Markov assumption that governs most single-agent RL methods and is one of
the key challenges in multi-agent RL. To tackle this, we propose to train
multiple policies for each agent and postpone the selection of the best policy
at execution time. Specifically, we model the environment non-stationarity with
a finite set of scenarios and train policies fitting each scenario. In addition
to multiple policies, each agent also learns a policy predictor to determine
which policy is the best with its local information. By doing so, each agent is
able to adapt its policy when the environment changes and consequentially the
other agents alter their policies during execution. We empirically evaluated
our method on a variety of common benchmark problems proposed for multi-agent
deep RL in the literature. Our experimental results show that the agents
trained by our algorithm have better adaptiveness in changing environments and
outperform the state-of-the-art methods in all the tested environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00949v1

remains unchanged. Polarization properties of the strong and weak modes are
investigated. Considering the similarity to mode changing, we argue that the
periodic amplitude modulation in PSR J1048$-$5832 is periodic mode changing.
The fluctuation spectral analysis showed that the modulation period is very

Dark matter filtering-out effect during a first-order phase transition,2019-12-09T18:24:49Z,"Dongjin Chway, Tae Hyun Jung, Chang Sub Shin","If the mass of dark matter is generated from a cosmological phase transition
involving the nucleation of bubbles, the corresponding bubble walls can filter
out dark matter particles during the phase transition. Only particles with
sufficient momentum to overcome their mass inside the bubbles can pass through
the walls. As a result, the dark matter number density after the phase
transition has a suppression factor $\exp(-M_\chi/2\tilde \gamma T)$, where
$M_\chi$ is the dark matter mass, and $\tilde \gamma$ and $T$ are the Lorentz
factor and temperature of the incoming fluid in the bubble wall rest frame,
respectively. Under certain assumptions, we show that the filtering-out process
can naturally provide a large suppression consistent with the observed dark
matter density for a wide range of dark matter masses up to the Planck scale.
Since the first-order phase transition is the decisive ingredient in our
mechanism, a new connection is made between heavy dark matter scenarios and

"Emergence and spectral-weight transfer of electronic states in the
  Hubbard ladder",2019-12-11T02:00:33Z,Masanori Kohno,"The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of
the electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the
spectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron
density, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron
density changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become
dominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard
ladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the
non-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode
emerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the
electron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at
quarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the
low-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott
transition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion
relation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the
electronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new
perspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic
states over a wide energy and electron-density regime.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05080v2

modification, a safe and efficient lane change behavior can be achieved. With
the setting of our state representation and reward function, the trained agent

Enhancement of Energy-Based Swing-Up Controller via Entropy Search,2019-04-02T04:56:09Z,"Chang Sik Lee, Dong Eui Chang","An energy based approach for stabilizing a mechanical system has offered a
simple yet powerful control scheme. However, since it does not impose such
strong constraints on parameter space of the controller, finding appropriate
parameter values for an optimal controller is known to be hard. This paper
intends to generate an optimal energy-based controller for swinging up a rotary
inverted pendulum, also known as the Furuta pendulum, by applying the Bayesian
optimization called Entropy Search. Simulations and experiments show that the
optimal controller has an improved performance compared to a nominal controller

Adaptive Sequential Machine Learning,2019-04-04T20:03:46Z,"Craig Wilson, Yuheng Bu, Venugopal Veeravalli","A framework previously introduced in [3] for solving a sequence of stochastic
optimization problems with bounded changes in the minimizers is extended and
applied to machine learning problems such as regression and classification. The
stochastic optimization problems arising in these machine learning problems is
solved using algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). A method
based on estimates of the change in the minimizers and properties of the
optimization algorithm is introduced for adaptively selecting the number of
samples at each time step to ensure that the excess risk, i.e., the expected
gap between the loss achieved by the approximate minimizer produced by the
optimization algorithm and the exact minimizer, does not exceed a target level.
A bound is developed to show that the estimate of the change in the minimizers
is non-trivial provided that the excess risk is small enough. Extensions
relevant to the machine learning setting are considered, including a cost-based
approach to select the number of samples with a cost budget over a fixed
horizon, and an approach to applying cross-validation for model selection.
Finally, experiments with synthetic and real data are used to validate the
algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02773v1
Anisotropic magnetocaloric effect in Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$,2019-04-08T07:31:42Z,"Yu Liu, Jun Li, Jing Tao, Yimei Zhu, C. Petrovic","We present a comprehensive study on anisotropic magnetocaloric porperties of
the van der Waals weak-itinerant ferromagnet Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ that features
gate-tunable room-temperature ferromagnetism in few-layer device. Intrinsic
magnetocrystalline anisotropy is observed to be temperature-dependent and most
likely favors the long-range magnetic order in thin Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ crsytal.
The magnetic entropy change $-\Delta S_M$ also reveals an anisotropic
characteristic between $H // ab$ and $H // c$, which could be well scaled into
a universal curve. The peak value $-\Delta S_M^{max}$ of 1.20 J kg$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$ and the corresponding adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$ of
0.66 K are deduced from heat capacity with out-of-plane field change of 5 T. By
fitting of the field-dependent parameters of $-\Delta S_M^{max}$ and the
relative cooling power RCP, it gives $-\Delta S_M^{max} \propto H^n$ with $n =
0.603(6)$ and $RCP \propto H^m$ with $m = 1.20(1)$ when $H // c$. Given the

ACE: Adapting to Changing Environments for Semantic Segmentation,2019-04-12T15:15:15Z,"Zuxuan Wu, Xin Wang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Tom Goldstein, Larry S. Davis","Deep neural networks exhibit exceptional accuracy when they are trained and
tested on the same data distributions. However, neural classifiers are often
extremely brittle when confronted with domain shift---changes in the input
distribution that occur over time. We present ACE, a framework for semantic
segmentation that dynamically adapts to changing environments over the time. By
aligning the distribution of labeled training data from the original source
domain with the distribution of incoming data in a shifted domain, ACE
synthesizes labeled training data for environments as it sees them. This
stylized data is then used to update a segmentation model so that it performs
well in new environments. To avoid forgetting knowledge from past environments,
we introduce a memory that stores feature statistics from previously seen
domains. These statistics can be used to replay images in any of the previously
observed domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. In addition to
standard batch training using stochastic gradient decent (SGD), we also
experiment with fast adaptation methods based on adaptive meta-learning.
Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets from SYNTHIA, the results

well understood phenomena: radiation pressure instability and formation of the
inner optically thin Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow. The limit cycle
behaviour takes place in a relatively narrow transition zone between the
standard disk and optically thin flow. Large changes in the cold disk are due
to the irradiation by the hot flow with accretion rate strongly varying during

few tools to probe changes of orbital magnetic moment. In this study, we
developed an electric-field- (E)-induced X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(EXMCD) technique to apply E to a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate. We reversibly
tuned the interfacial lattice constants of Ni/Cu multilayers on BaTiO3 using
this technique. As the domain structures in BaTiO3 are modulated by E, EXMCD
measurements reveal that the changes in the magnetic anisotropy of Ni/Cu films
are induced through the modulation of orbital magnetic moments in Ni with
magneto-elastic contributions. The strained Ni layer that induces the
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy without E is released at E = 8 kV/cm, and
in-plane magnetization also occurs. We observed that EXMCD measurements
clarified the origin of the reversible changes in perpendicular magnetic

We focus on the stick-slip phenomenon while users explore surfaces with an

pseudo-haptic feedback that represents static friction on the surface. In our
method, users watch a virtual contact point become stuck at the contact point
on screen while users freely move the input device. We hypothesize that the
perceived probability and intensity of static friction sensation can be
controlled by changing the static friction coefficient as a visual parameter.
User studies were conducted, and results show the threshold value over which
users felt the pseudo-haptic static friction sensation at 90% probability. The
results also show that the perceived intensity of the sensation changed with

"Field Dependent Conductivity and Threshold Switching in Amorphous
  Chalcogenides -- Modeling and Simulations of Ovonic Threshold Switches and
  Phase Change Memory Devices",2019-06-21T20:52:22Z,"Jake Scoggin, Helena Silva, Ali Gokirmak","We model electrical conductivity in metastable amorphous $Ge_{2}Sb_{2}Te_{5}$
using independent contributions from temperature and electric field to simulate
phase change memory devices and Ovonic threshold switches. 3D, 2D-rotational,
and 2D finite element simulations of pillar cells capture threshold switching
and show filamentary conduction in the on-state. The model can be tuned to
capture switching fields from ~5 to 40 MV/m at room temperature using the
temperature dependent electrical conductivity measured for metastable amorphous
GST; lower and higher fields are obtainable using different temperature
dependent electrical conductivities. We use a 2D fixed out-of-plane-depth
simulation to simulate an Ovonic threshold switch in series with a
$Ge_{2}Sb_{2}Te_{5}$ phase change memory cell to emulate a crossbar memory
element. The simulation reproduces the pre-switching current and voltage
characteristics found experimentally for the switch + memory cell, isolated
switch, and isolated memory cell.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09316v1

one-dimensional moir\'e crystals. We study one-dimensional double-wall carbon
nanotubes (DWCNTs) in which van der Waals-coupled two single nanotubes form
one-dimensional moir\'e superlattice. We experimentally combine Rayleigh
scattering spectroscopy and electron beam diffraction on the same individual
DWCNTs to probe the optical transitions of structure-identified DWCNTs in the
visible spectral range. Among more than 30 structure-identified DWCNTs
examined, we experimentally observed and identified a drastic change of optical
transition spectrum in DWCNT with chirality (12,11)@(17,16). The origin of the
marked change is attributed to the strong intertube coupling effect in a
moir\'e superlattice formed by two nearly-armchair nanotubes. Our numerical
simulation is consistent to these experimental findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09421v2
"Light-induced optical switching in an asymmetric metal-dielectric
  microcavity with phase-change material",2019-06-23T19:58:28Z,"R. Thomas, A. A. Chabanov, I. Vitebskiy, T. Kottos","We propose an infrared power switch based on an asymmetric high-Q microcavity
incorporating a metallic nanolayer in close proximity to a layer made of a
phase-change material (PCM). The microcavity is designed so that when the PCM
layer is in the low-temperature phase, the metallic nanolayer coincides with a
nodal plane of the resonant electric field component, to allow a high resonant
transmittance. As the light intensity exceeds a certain threshold,
light-induced heating of the PCM layer triggers the phase transition
accompanied by an abrupt change in its refractive index in the vicinity of the
transition temperature. The latter results in a shift of the nodal plane away
from the metallic nanolayer, rendering the entire microcavity highly reflective
over a broad frequency range. The nearly binary nature of the PCM refractive
index allows for the low-intensity resonant transmission over a broad range of
ambient temperatures below the transition point.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09640v1
Time-evolving psychological processes over repeated decisions,2019-06-26T04:12:50Z,"David Gunawan, Guy E. Hawkins, Robert Kohn, Minh-Ngoc Tran, Scott D. Brown","Many psychological experiments have subjects repeat a task to gain the
statistical precision required to test quantitative theories of psychological
performance. In such experiments, time-on-task can have sizable effects on
performance, changing the psychological processes under investigation. Most
research has either ignored these changes, treating the underlying process as
static, or sacrificed some psychological content of the models for statistical
simplicity. We use particle Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods to study
psychologically plausible time-varying changes in model parameters. Using data
from three highly-cited experiments we find strong evidence in favor of a
hidden Markov switching process as an explanation of time-varying effects. This
embodies the psychological assumption of ""regime switching"", with subjects
alternating between different cognitive states representing different modes of
decision-making. The switching model explains key long- and short-term dynamic
effects in the data. The central idea of our approach can be applied quite
generally to quantitative psychological theories, beyond the models and data
sets that we investigate.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10838v3
"Dual Adaptivity: A Universal Algorithm for Minimizing the Adaptive
  Regret of Convex Functions",2019-06-26T05:23:26Z,"Lijun Zhang, Guanghui Wang, Wei-Wei Tu, Zhi-Hua Zhou","To deal with changing environments, a new performance measure -- adaptive
regret, defined as the maximum static regret over any interval, was proposed in
online learning. Under the setting of online convex optimization, several
algorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.
However, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only
handle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters.
By contrast, there exist universal algorithms, such as MetaGrad, that attain
optimal static regret for multiple types of convex functions simultaneously.
Along this line of research, this paper presents the first universal algorithm
for minimizing the adaptive regret of convex functions. Specifically, we borrow
the idea of maintaining multiple learning rates in MetaGrad to handle the
uncertainty of functions, and utilize the technique of sleeping experts to
capture changing environments. In this way, our algorithm automatically adapts
to the property of functions (convex, exponentially concave, or strongly
convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary or changing). As a
by product, it also allows the type of functions to switch between rounds.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10851v2
Tuning environmental timescales to evolve and maintain generalists,2019-06-27T19:22:53Z,"Vedant Sachdeva, Kabir Husain, Jiming Sheng, Shenshen Wang, Arvind Murugan","Natural environments can present diverse challenges, but some genotypes
remain fit across many environments. Such `generalists' can be hard to evolve,
out-competed by specialists fitter in any particular environment. Here,
inspired by the search for broadly-neutralising antibodies during B-cell
affinity maturation, we demonstrate that environmental changes on an
intermediate timescale can reliably evolve generalists, even when faster or
slower environmental changes are unable to do so. We find that changing
environments on timescales comparable to evolutionary transients in a
population enhances the rate of evolving generalists from specialists, without
enhancing the reverse process. The yield of generalists is further increased in
more complex dynamic environments, such as a `chirp' of increasing frequency.
Our work offers design principles for how non-equilibrium fitness `seascapes'
can dynamically funnel populations to genotypes unobtainable in static
environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11924v1
Studying the Impact of Mood on Identifying Smartphone Users,2019-06-27T20:55:16Z,"Khadija Zanna, Sayde King, Tempestt Neal, Shaun Canavan","This paper explores the identification of smartphone users when certain
samples collected while the subject felt happy, upset or stressed were absent
or present. We employ data from 19 subjects using the StudentLife dataset, a
dataset collected by researchers at Dartmouth College that was originally
collected to correlate behaviors characterized by smartphone usage patterns
with changes in stress and academic performance. Although many previous works
on behavioral biometrics have implied that mood is a source of intra-person
variation which may impact biometric performance, our results contradict this
assumption. Our findings show that performance worsens when removing samples
that were generated when subjects may be happy, upset, or stressed. Thus, there
is no indication that mood negatively impacts performance. However, we do find
that changes existing in smartphone usage patterns may correlate with mood,
including changes in locking, audio, location, calling, homescreen, and e-mail
habits. Thus, we show that while mood is a source of intra-person variation, it
may be an inaccurate assumption that biometric systems (particularly, mobile
biometrics) are likely influenced by mood.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11960v1
"Test for parameter change in the presence of outliers: the density power
  divergence based approach",2019-06-28T13:39:56Z,"Junmo Song, Jiwon Kang","This study considers the problem of testing for a parameter change in the
presence of outliers. For this, we propose a robust test using the objective
function of minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) by Basu et al.

procedure can be naturally extended to any parametric model to which MDPDE can
be applied. To illustrate this, we apply our test procedure to GARCH models. We
demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed test through a
simulation study. In a real data application to the Hang Seng index, our test
locates some change-points that are not detected by the previous tests such as
the score test and the residual-based CUSUM test.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00004v3
"Generative Guiding Block: Synthesizing Realistic Looking Variants
  Capable of Even Large Change Demands",2019-07-02T06:24:21Z,"Minho Park, Hak Gu Kim, Yong Man Ro","Realistic image synthesis is to generate an image that is perceptually
indistinguishable from an actual image. Generating realistic looking images
with large variations (e.g., large spatial deformations and large pose change),
however, is very challenging. Handing large variations as well as preserving
appearance needs to be taken into account in the realistic looking image
generation. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic looking image synthesis
method, especially in large change demands. To do that, we devise generative
guiding blocks. The proposed generative guiding block includes realistic
appearance preserving discriminator and naturalistic variation transforming
discriminator. By taking the proposed generative guiding blocks into generative
model, the latent features at the layer of generative model are enhanced to
synthesize both realistic looking- and target variation- image. With
qualitative and quantitative evaluation in experiments, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed generative guiding blocks, compared to the

Adapting Stable Matchings to Evolving Preferences,2019-07-02T13:57:10Z,"Robert Bredereck, Jiehua Chen, Du≈°an Knop, Junjie Luo, Rolf Niedermeier","Adaptivity to changing environments and constraints is key to success in
modern society. We address this by proposing ""incrementalized versions"" of
Stable Marriage and Stable Roommates. That is, we try to answer the following
question: for both problems, what is the computational cost of adapting an
existing stable matching after some of the preferences of the agents have
changed. While doing so, we also model the constraint that the new stable
matching shall be not too different from the old one. After formalizing these
incremental versions, we provide a fairly comprehensive picture of the
computational complexity landscape of Incremental Stable Marriage and
Incremental Stable Roommates. To this end, we exploit the parameters ""degree of
change"" both in the input (difference between old and new preference profile)
and in the output (difference between old and new stable matching). We obtain
both hardness and tractability results, in particular showing a fixed-parameter
tractability result with respect to the parameter ""distance between old and new
stable matching"".",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01375v2

a partial alignment of magnetic moments in the paramagnetic region overlapping
with the magnetocaloric effect of the first-order phase transition.
Additionally, the first-order phase transition is not completed even in fields
up to 20 T leading to a non-saturating behavior of DTad. Measurements in
different pulsed fields reveal that the first-order phase transition cannot
follow the fast field changes as previously assumed, resulting in a distinct

suspended graphene in the ballistic regime. Utilizing parametrized tight
binding Hamiltonian from ab initio calculations along with Landauer quantum
transport formalism, we devise a methodology to evaluate the piezoresistance

transverse gauge factor of graphene along armchair and zigzag directions in the
linear elastic limit ($0\%$-$10\%$). The longitudinal and transverse gauge
factors are identical along armchair and zigzag directions. Our model predicts
a significant variation ($\approx 1000\% $ change) in transverse gauge factor
compared to longitudinal gauge factor along with sign inversion. The calculated
value of longitudinal gauge factor is $\approx 0.3$ whereas the transverse
gauge factor is $\approx -3.3$. We rationalize our prediction using deformation
of Dirac cone and change in separation between transverse modes due to
longitudinal and transverse strain, leading to an inverse change in gauge

"Modeling Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices with An Application to
  Functional Brain Connectivity",2019-07-08T02:28:39Z,"Zhenhua Lin, Dehan Kong, Qiang Sun","In neuroscience, functional brain connectivity describes the connectivity
between brain regions that share functional properties. Neuroscientists often
characterize it by a time series of covariance matrices between functional
measurements of distributed neuron areas. An effective statistical model for
functional connectivity and its changes over time is critical for better
understanding the mechanisms of brain and various neurological diseases. To
this end, we propose a matrix-log mean model with an additive heterogeneous
noise for modeling random symmetric positive definite matrices that lie in a
Riemannian manifold. The heterogeneity of error terms is introduced
specifically to capture the curved nature of the manifold. We then propose to
use the local scan statistics to detect change patterns in the functional
connectivity. Theoretically, we show that our procedure can recover all change
points consistently. Simulation studies and an application to the Human
Connectome Project lend further support to the proposed methodology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03385v1
