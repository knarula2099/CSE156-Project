Link Climate: An Interoperable Knowledge Graph Platform for Climate Data,2022-10-28T10:52:50Z,"Jiantao Wu, Fabrizio Orlandi, Declan O'Sullivan, Soumyabrata Dev","Climate science has become more ambitious in recent years as global awareness
about the environment has grown. To better understand climate, historical
climate (e.g. archived meteorological variables such as temperature, wind,
water, etc.) and climate-related data (e.g. geographical features and human
activities) are widely used by today's climate research to derive models for an
explainable climate change and its effects. However, such data sources are
often dispersed across a multitude of disconnected data silos on the Web.
Moreover, there is a lack of advanced climate data platforms to enable
multi-source heterogeneous climate data analysis, therefore, researchers must
face a stern challenge in collecting and analyzing multi-source data. In this
paper, we address this problem by proposing a climate knowledge graph for the
integration of multiple climate data and other data sources into one service,
leveraging Web technologies (e.g. HTTP) for multi-source climate data analysis.
The proposed knowledge graph is primarily composed of data from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's daily climate summaries,
OpenStreetMap, and Wikidata, and it supports joint data queries on these widely
used databases. This paper shows, with a use case in Ireland and the United
Kingdom, how climate researchers could benefit from this platform as it allows
them to easily integrate datasets from different domains and geographical
locations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16050v1
"How relevant is climate change research for climate change policy? An
  empirical analysis based on Overton data",2022-03-10T13:18:11Z,"Lutz Bornmann, Robin Haunschild, Kevin Boyack, Werner Marx, Jan C. Minx","Climate change is an ongoing topic in nearly all areas of society since many
years. A discussion of climate change without referring to scientific results
is not imaginable. This is especially the case for policies since action on the
macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society. In this
study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy
are connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was
released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.
The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be
reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we
suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in
Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on
policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents
around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point
out that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have
published more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that
climate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents
received significantly more citations on average than climate change papers
that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and
policy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth
sciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical
results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a
chain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment
reports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents
(policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government
reports to legislative documents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05358v1
On the Financing of Climate Change Adaptation in Developing Countries,2022-10-20T18:52:36Z,Francis X. Diebold,"I offer reflections on adaptation to climate change, with emphasis on

Climate-Contingent Finance,2022-07-05T14:15:19Z,John Nay,"Climate adaptation could yield significant benefits. However, the uncertainty
of which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of
proactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by
benefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is
designed to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial
risk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the
level of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance
adaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for
entities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as
an investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of
return when they need it most.
  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they
over-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.
This is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in
climate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but
also outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic
value. This coordinates capital through time and place according to parties'
risk reduction capabilities and financial profiles, while also providing a
diversifying investment return.
  Climate-contingent finance can be generalized to any situation where entities
share exposure to a risk where they lack direct control over whether it occurs
(e.g., climate change, or a natural pandemic), and one type of entity can take
proactive actions to benefit from addressing the effects of the risk if it
occurs (e.g., through innovating on crops that would do well under extreme
climate change or vaccination technology that could address particular viruses)
with funding from another type of entity that seeks a targeted return to
ameliorate the downside.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02064v1
"Analysis of various climate change parameters in India using machine
  learning",2022-01-25T06:46:46Z,"Rutvij Wamanse, Tushuli Patil","Climate change in India is one of the most alarming problems faced by our
community. Due to adverse and sudden changes in climate in past few years,
mankind is at threat. Various impacts of climate change include extreme heat,
changing rainfall patterns, droughts, groundwater, glacier melt, sea-level
rise, and many more. Machine Learning can be used to analyze and predict the
graph of change using previous data and thus design a model which in the future
can furthermore be used to catalyze impactful work of climate change and take
steps in the direction to help India fight against the upcoming climate
changes. In this paper, we have analyzed 17 climate change parameters about
India. We have applied linear regression, exponential regression, and
polynomial regression to the parameters and evaluated the results. Using the
designed model, we will predict these parameters for the years 2025,2030, 2035.
These predicted values will thus help our community to prevent and take actions
against the adverse and hazardous effects on mankind. We have designed and
created this model which provides accurate results regarding all 17 parameters.
The predicted values will therefore help India to be well equipped against
climate change. This data when made available to the people of India will help
create awareness among them and will help us save our country from the
haphazard effects of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10123v1
"Revisiting the secondary climate attributes for transportation
  infrastructure management: A Redux and Update for 2020",2022-02-25T03:33:50Z,"Tao Liao, Paul Kepley, Indraneel Kumar, Samuel Labi","Environmental conditions in various regions can have a severely negative
impact on the longevity and durability of the civil engineering
infrastructures. In 2018, a published paper used 1971 to 2010 NOAA data from
the contiguous United States to examine the temporal changes in secondary
climate attributes (freeze-thaw cycles and freeze index) using the climate
normals from two time windows, 1971-2000 and 1981-2010. That paper investigated
whether there have been statistically significant changes in climate attribute
levels across the two time windows, and used GIS-based interpolation methods to
develop isarithmic maps of the climate attributes to facilitate their
interpretation and application. This paper updates that study. In this study,
we use NOAA climatic data from 1991 to 2020 to construct continuous surface
maps showing the values of the primary and secondary climate attributes at the
48 continental states. The new maps provide an updated picture of the freeze
index values and freeze-thaw cycles for the most recent climate condition.
These new values provide a better picture of the freezing season
characteristics of the United States, and will provide information necessary
for better winter maintenance procedures and infrastructure design to
accommodate regional climate differences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12480v1
Economic activity and climate change,2022-06-07T11:18:15Z,"Aránzazu de Juan, Pilar Poncela, Vladimir Rodríguez-Caballero, Esther Ruiz","In this paper, we survey recent econometric contributions to measure the
relationship between economic activity and climate change. Due to the critical
relevance of these effects for the well-being of future generations, there is
an explosion of publications devoted to measuring this relationship and its
main channels. The relation between economic activity and climate change is
complex with the possibility of causality running in both directions. Starting
from economic activity, the channels that relate economic activity and climate
change are energy consumption and the consequent pollution. Hence, we first
describe the main econometric contributions about the interactions between
economic activity and energy consumption, moving then to describing the
contributions on the interactions between economic activity and pollution.
Finally, we look at the main results on the relationship between climate change
and economic activity. An important consequence of climate change is the
increasing occurrence of extreme weather phenomena. Therefore, we also survey
contributions on the economic effects of catastrophic climate phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03187v2
"A Multi-task Model for Sentiment Aided Stance Detection of Climate
  Change Tweets",2022-11-07T13:19:44Z,"Apoorva Upadhyaya, Marco Fisichella, Wolfgang Nejdl","Climate change has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. Social
media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public
awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate
crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate
change through social media, the information could create more awareness and
reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter
communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies,
and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers.
In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on
Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two
attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of
Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes
toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely
related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change
tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection
(primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The
proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention
frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for
both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases
the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from
the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and
single-task variants.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03533v1

"Avoiding the ""Great Filter"": An Assessment of Climate Change Solutions
  and Combinations for Effective Implementation",2022-04-30T02:25:14Z,"Junze Zhang, Kerry Zhang, Mary Zhang, Jonathan H. Jiang, Philip E. Rosen, Kristen A. Fahy","Climate change is the long-term shift in global weather patterns, largely
caused by anthropogenic activity of greenhouse gas emissions. Global climate
temperatures have unmistakably risen and naturally occurring climate
variability alone cannot account for this trend. Human activities are estimated
to have caused about 1.0 degree C of global warming above the pre-industrial
baseline and if left unchecked, will continue to drastically damage the Earth
and its inhabitants. Globally, natural disasters and subsequent economic losses
have become increasingly impactful because of climate change. Both wildlife
ecosystems and human habitats have been negatively impacted, from rising sea
levels to alarming frequency of severe weather events around the world.
Attempts towards alleviating the effects of global warming have often been at
odds and remain divided among a multitude of strategies, reducing the overall
effectiveness of these efforts. It is evident that collaborative action is
required for avoiding the most severe consequences of climate change. This
paper evaluates the main strategies (industrial/energy, political, economic,
agricultural, atmospheric, geological, coastal, and social) towards both
mitigating and adapting to climate change. As well, it provides an optimal
combination of seven solutions which can be implemented simultaneously, working
in tandem to limit and otherwise accommodate the harmful effects of climate
change. Previous legislation and deployment techniques are also discussed as
guides for future endeavors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00133v2
