Financial climate risk: a review of recent advances and key challenges,2024-04-10T20:17:43Z,Victor Cardenas,"The document provides an overview of financial climate risks. It delves into
how climate change impacts the global financial system, distinguishing between
physical risks (such as extreme weather events) and transition risks (stemming
from policy changes and economic transitions towards low carbon technologies).
The paper underlines the complexity of accurately defining financial climate
risk, citing the integration of climate science with financial risk analysis as
a significant challenge. The paper highlights the pivotal role of microfinance
institutions (MFIs) in addressing financial climate risk, especially for
populations vulnerable to climate change. The document emphasizes the
importance of updating risk management practices within MFIs to explicitly
include climate risk assessments and suggests leveraging technology to improve
these practices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07331v1
"Indexing and Visualization of Climate Change Narratives Using BERT and
  Causal Extraction",2024-08-03T11:05:41Z,"Hiroki Sakaji, Noriyasu Kaneda","In this study, we propose a methodology to extract, index, and visualize
``climate change narratives'' (stories about the connection between causal and
consequential events related to climate change). We use two natural language
processing methods, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) and causal extraction, to textually analyze newspaper articles on
climate change to extract ``climate change narratives.'' The novelty of the
methodology could extract and quantify the causal relationships assumed by the
newspaper's writers. Looking at the extracted climate change narratives over
time, we find that since 2018, an increasing number of narratives suggest the
impact of the development of climate change policy discussion and the
implementation of climate change-related policies on corporate behaviors,
macroeconomics, and price dynamics. We also observed the recent emergence of
narratives focusing on the linkages between climate change-related policies and
monetary policy. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the negative
impacts of natural disasters (e.g., abnormal weather and severe floods) related
to climate change on economic activities, and this issue might be perceived as
a new challenge for companies and governments. The methodology of this study is
expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, as it can analyze causal
relationships among various economic topics, including analysis of inflation
expectation or monetary policy communication strategy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01745v1

  Climate Information on Charitable Donations to Climate Activism",2024-09-25T21:45:13Z,"Samantha Gonsalves Wetherell, Anna Josephson","We examine the propensity of individuals to donate to climate activism,
evaluating the impact of different informational treatments on an incentive
compatible charitable donation and stated climate change-related concerns.
Participants were evaluated on climate literacy and general climate attitudes
before being randomly assigned to a treatment which provided either education
or neutral language about climate change, either with or without images of
protest. After the treatment, participants engaged in an incentive compatible
dictator game. We find that participants gave more to climate activism than
seen in previous dictator game and charitable giving experiments, in both
average amount given and proportion of participants who gave their entire
endowment. However, we determine that climate activism information negatively
influenced the amount of money donated. We also found that protest imagery
moderated this negative effect and had a positive significant effect of
increasing participants' climate concern. Finally, we found that the climate
concern was significantly positively correlated with donations, while being a
male was significantly negatively associated with donation amounts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17378v1
"Climate Impact Assessment Requires Weighting: Introducing the Weighted
  Climate Dataset",2024-12-20T09:18:22Z,"Marco Gortan, Lorenzo Testa, Giorgio Fagiolo, Francesco Lamperti","High-resolution gridded climate data are readily available from multiple
sources, yet climate research and decision-making increasingly require country
and region-specific climate information weighted by socio-economic factors.
Moreover, the current landscape of disparate data sources and inconsistent
weighting methodologies exacerbates the reproducibility crisis and undermines
scientific integrity. To address these issues, we have developed a globally
comprehensive dataset at both country (GADM0) and region (GADM1) levels,
encompassing various climate indicators (precipitation, temperature, SPEI, wind
gust). Our methodology involves weighting gridded climate data by population
density, night-time light intensity, cropland area, and concurrent population
count -- all proxies for socio-economic activity -- before aggregation. We
process data from multiple sources, offering daily, monthly, and annual climate
variables spanning from 1900 to 2023. A unified framework streamlines our
preprocessing steps, and rigorous validation against leading climate impact

solution. In this study, we address this gap by developing a two-step
hierarchical model, the Augmented CARDS model, specifically designed for
detecting contrarian climate claims on Twitter. Furthermore, we apply the
Augmented CARDS model to five million climate-themed tweets over a six-month
period in 2022. We find that over half of contrarian climate claims on Twitter

climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science.
Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to
represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial
uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation
schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback,
continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the
performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for
temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE)
imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL
approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms
performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving
more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based
parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving
accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this

A Run on Fossil Fuel? Climate Change and Transition Risk,2024-10-01T17:45:48Z,Michael Barnett,"I study the dynamic, general equilibrium implications of
climate-change-linked transition risk on macroeconomic outcomes and asset
prices. Climate-change-linked expectations of fossil fuel restrictions can
produce a ``run on fossil fuels'' with accelerated production and decreasing
spot prices, or a ``reverse run'' with restrained production and increased spot
prices. The response depends on the expected economic consequences of the
anticipated transition shock, and existing climate policies. Fossil fuel firm
prices decrease in each case. I use a novel empirical measure of innovations in
climate-related transition risk likelihood to show that dynamic empirical
responses are consistent with a ``run on fossil fuel.''",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00902v1

"Incorporating climate change effects into the European power system
  adequacy assessment using a post-processing method",2024-02-26T21:44:36Z,"Inès Harang, Fabian Heymann, Laurens P. Stoop","The demand-supply balance of electricity systems is fundamentally linked to
climate conditions. In light of this, the present study aims to model the
effect of climate change on the European electricity system, specifically on
its long-term reliability. A resource adequate power system -- a system where
electricity supply covers demand -- is sensitive to generation capacity, demand
patterns, and the network structure and capacity. Climate change is foreseen to
affect each of these components.
  In this analysis, we focused on two drivers of power system adequacy: the
impact of temperature variations on electricity demand, and of water inflows
changes on hydro generation. Using a post-processing approach, based on results
found in the literature, the inputs of a large-scale electricity market model
covering the European region were modified. The results show that climate
change may decrease total LOLE (Loss of Load Expectation) hours in Europe by
more than 50%, as demand will largely decrease because of a higher temperatures
during winter. We found that the climate change impact on demand tends to
decrease LOLE values, while the climate change effects on hydrological
conditions tend to increase LOLE values.
  The study is built on a limited amount of open-source data and can flexibly
incorporate various sets of assumptions. Outcomes also show the current
difficulties to reliably model the effects of climate change on power system
adequacy. Overall, our presented method displays the relevance of climate
change effects in electricity network studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17039v2

(US) over the last three decades, having a significant impact on air quality

subsequent smoke exposure is challenging, as both natural variability and
anthropogenic climate change play important roles. Here we devise an approach
involving observed meteorology and vegetation and a range of models to
determine the relative roles of anthropogenic climate change and natural
variability in driving burned area across the western US. We also examine the
influence of anthropogenic climate change on smoke exposure. We estimate that
anthropogenic climate change accounts for 33-82% of observed total burned area,
depending on the ecoregion, yielding 65% of total fire emissions on average
across the western US from 1992 to 2020. In all ecoregions except Mediterranean
California, anthropogenic climate change contributes to a greater percentage of
burned area in lightning-caused wildfires than in human-caused wildfires. On
average, anthropogenic climate change contributes 49% to smoke PM2.5
concentrations in the western US from 1997 to 2020, and explains 58% of the
increasing trend in smoke PM2.5 from 2010 to 2020. We further find that
populations in northern California, western Oregon, Washington, and parts of
Idaho have experienced the greatest smoke exposure attributable to
anthropogenic climate change in recent years. Our work highlights the
significant role of anthropogenic climate change in degrading air quality in
the western US and identifies those regions most vulnerable to wildfire smoke

parameterizations that crudely but efficiently approximate these processes are
a leading source of uncertainty in long-term projected warming and
precipitation patterns. Machine Learning (ML)-based parameterizations have long
been hailed as a promising alternative with the potential to yield higher
accuracy at a fraction of the cost of more explicit simulations. However, these
ML variants are often unpredictably unstable and inaccurate in \textit{coupled}
testing (i.e. in a downstream hybrid simulation task where they are dynamically
interacting with the large-scale climate model). These issues are exacerbated
in out-of-distribution climates. Certain design decisions such as
``climate-invariant"" feature transformation for moisture inputs, input vector
expansion, and temporal history incorporation have been shown to improve
coupled performance, but they may be insufficient for coupled
out-of-distribution generalization. If feature selection and transformations

coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has

power generation capacity of renewable energy under the influence of climate
change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However,
due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often
lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and
uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a
super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance
the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty.
The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that
generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling
mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value
using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic

conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation
reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under
two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM
outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate
data. For the Ejina region, under a high-emission pathway, the annual
utilization hours of wind power are projected to decrease by 2.82 hours/year,
while those for PV power are projected to decrease by 0.26 hours/year.

with a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxides (CO2). In such conditions, the
planetary climate and habitability are determined by the distribution of CO2
between exchangeable reservoirs, that is the atmosphere, ice caps, and
regolith. This produces unique responses of the Martian CO2-driven climate
system to variations of astronomical forcings. Specifically, it has been shown
that the phenomenon called an atmospheric collapse occurs when the axial
obliquity is low, affecting the Martian climatic evolution. However, the
behavior of the Martian climate system and the accompanying changes in climate
and habitability of such planets remain ambiguous. Here we employed a
latitudinally-resolved Martian energy balance model and assessed the possible
climate on Mars for wider ranges of orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and
total exchangeable CO2 mass. We show that the atmospheric collapse occurs when
the obliquity is below ~10 degrees when other parameters are kept at the
present Mars condition. We also show that the climate solutions on Mars depend
on orbital parameters, solar luminosity, and the total exchangeable CO2 mass.
We found that the atmospheric collapse would have occurred repeatedly in the
history of Mars following the variation of the axial obliquity, while the
long-term evolution of atmospheric pCO2 is also affected by the changes in the
total exchangeable CO2 mass in Martian history. Even considering the broad

"Save the Farms: Nonlinear Impact of Climate Change on Banks'
  Agricultural Lending",2024-09-28T21:53:01Z,Teng Liu,"The agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of climate
change. In this paper, I investigate how vulnerability to climate change
affects U.S. farms' credit access, and demonstrates that such impact is
unequally distributed across farms. I first construct a theoretical framework
of bank lending to farms faced with climate risks, and the model helps
discipline ensuing empirical analyses that use novel panel datasets at county
and at bank levels. I find that higher exposure to climate change, measured by
temperature anomaly, reduces bank lending to farms. Such impact is persistent,
nonlinear, and heterogeneous. Small and medium farms almost always experience
loss of loan access. In comparison, large farms see less severe credit
contraction, and in some cases may even see improvement in funding. While small
banks carry the burden of continuing to lend to small farms, their limited
market share cannot compensate for the reduction of lending from medium and
large banks. These results suggest that factors such as farm size and bank type
can amplify the financial impact of climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19463v1

"Amplified Summer Wind Stilling and Land Warming Compound Energy Risks in
  Northern Midlatitudes",2024-05-30T17:48:24Z,Gan Zhang,"Wind energy plays a critical role in mitigating climate change and meeting
growing energy demands. However, the long-term impacts of anthropogenic warming
on wind resources, particularly their seasonal variations and potential
compounding risks, remain understudied. Here we analyze large-ensemble climate
simulations in high-emission scenarios to assess the projected changes in
near-surface wind speed and their broader implications. Our analyses show
robust wind changes including a decrease of wind speed (i.e., stilling) up to
~15% during the summer months in Northern Midlatitudes. This stilling is linked
to amplified warming of the midlatitude land and the overlying troposphere.
Despite regional and model uncertainties, robust signals of warming-induced
wind stilling will likely emerge from natural climate variations in the late
21st century of the high-emission scenarios. Importantly, the summertime wind
stilling coincides with a projected surge in cooling demand, and their
compounding may disrupt the energy supply-demand balance earlier. These

transformational progress in the last 1-2 years, with state-of-the-art ones now
outperforming the best physics-based models for a wide range of skill scores.
Given the strong links between weather and climate modelling, this raises the
question whether machine learning models could also revolutionize climate
science, for example by informing mitigation and adaptation to climate change
or to generate larger ensembles for more robust uncertainty estimates. Here, we
show that current state-of-the-art machine learning models trained for weather
forecasting in present-day climate produce skillful forecasts across different
climate states corresponding to pre-industrial, present-day, and future 2.9K
warmer climates. This indicates that the dynamics shaping the weather on short
timescales may not differ fundamentally in a changing climate. It also
demonstrates out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the machine
learning models that are a critical prerequisite for climate applications.
Nonetheless, two of the models show a global-mean cold bias in the forecasts
for the future warmer climate state, i.e. they drift towards the colder
present-day climate they have been trained for. A similar result is obtained
for the pre-industrial case where two out of three models show a warming. We
discuss possible remedies for these biases and analyze their spatial
distribution, revealing complex warming and cooling patterns that are partly

evaluate the impact of this coupling on productivity and waste generation. In
this work, we present a novel methodology for modeling and assessing the
resilience of coupled natural-industrial ecosystems under climate change

liquid time-constant (LTC) neural networks as surrogate models to capture
complex, nonlinear dynamics of coupled agricultural and industrial systems. The
approach is demonstrated through a case study of a soybean-based biodiesel
production network in Champaign County, Illinois. LTC models are trained to
capture dynamics of nodes and are then coupled and driven by statistically
downscaled climate projections for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2006-2096.
The framework enables rapid simulation of system-wide material flow dynamics

reveal non-linear behaviors and potential tipping points in system resilience
under different climate scenarios and farm sizes. The RCP 8.5 scenario led to
earlier and more frequent production failures, increased reliance on imports
for smaller farms, and complex patterns of waste accumulation and stock levels.
The methodology provides valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and
adaptive capacities, offering decision support for enhancing the resilience and

Conditional multi-step attribution for climate forcings,2024-09-02T17:55:52Z,"Christopher R. Wentland, Michael Weylandt, Laura P. Swiler, Thomas S. Ehrmann, Diana Bull","Attribution of climate impacts to a source forcing is critical to
understanding, communicating, and addressing the effects of human influence on

fingerprinting, have been successfully applied to long-term, widespread effects
such as global surface temperature warming, they often struggle in low
signal-to-noise regimes, typical of short-term climate forcings or climate
variables which are loosely related to the forcing. Single-step approaches,
which directly relate a source forcing and final impact, are unable to utilize
additional climate information to improve attribution certainty. To address
this shortcoming, this paper presents a novel multi-step attribution approach
which is capable of analyzing multiple variables conditionally. A connected
series of climate effects are treated as dependent, and relationships found in
intermediary steps of a causal pathway are leveraged to better characterize the
forcing impact. This enables attribution of the forcing level responsible for
the observed impacts, while equivalent single-step approaches fail. Utilizing a
scalar feature describing the forcing impact, simple forcing response models,
and a conditional Bayesian formulation, this method can incorporate several
causal pathways to identify the correct forcing magnitude. As an exemplar of a
short-term, high-variance forcing, we demonstrate this method for the 1991
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Results indicate that including stratospheric and

comprehensive spatial data collection is not always feasible, requiring us to
predict climate variables at some locations. This study focuses on a prediction
of climatic elements, specifically near-surface temperature and pressure, at a
target location apart from a data observation point. Our approach uses two
prediction methods: reservoir computing (RC), known as a machine learning
framework with low computational requirements, and vector autoregression models
(VAR), recognized as a statistical method for analyzing time series data. Our
results show that the accuracy of the predictions degrades with the distance
between the observation and target locations. We quantitatively estimate the
distance in which effective predictions are possible. We also find that in the
context of climate data, a geographical distance is associated with data
correlation, and a strong data correlation significantly improves the
prediction accuracy with RC. In particular, RC outperforms VAR in predicting
highly correlated data within the predictive range. These findings suggest that
machine learning-based methods can be used more effectively to predict climatic
elements in remote locations by assessing the distance to them from the data
observation point in advance. Our study on low-cost and accurate prediction of
climate variables has significant value for climate change strategies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03061v1
"Impacts and risks of ""realistic"" global warming projections for the 21st
  century",2024-01-10T11:02:17Z,Nicola Scafetta,"The IPCC AR6 assessment of the impacts and risks associated with projected
climate changes for the 21st century is both alarming and ambiguous. According
to computer projections, the global surface may warm from 1.3 to 8.0 {\deg}C by
2100, depending on the global climate model (GCM) and the shared socioeconomic
pathway (SSP) scenario used for the simulations. However a substantial number
of CMIP6 GCMs run ""too hot"" because they appear to be too sensitive to
radiative forcing, and that the high/extreme emission scenarios SSP3-7.0 and
SSP5-8.5 must be rejected because judged to be ""unlikely"" and ""highly
unlikely"", respectively. This paper examines the impacts and risks of
""realistic"" climate change projections for the 21st century generated by
assessing the theoretical models and integrating them with the existing
empirical knowledge on global warming and the various natural cycles of climate
change that have been recorded by a variety of scientists and historians. This
is achieved by combining the ""realistic"" SSP2-4.5 scenario and empirically
optimized climate modeling. The obtained climate projections show that the
expected global surface warming for the 21st century will likely be mild, that
is, no more than 2.5-3.0 {\deg}C and, on average, likely below the 2.0 {\deg}C
threshold. This should allow for the mitigation and management of the most
dangerous climate-change-related hazards through appropriate low-cost
adaptation policies. In conclusion, enforcing expensive decarbonization and
net-zero emission scenarios, such as SSP1-2.6, is not required because the
Paris Agreement temperature target of keeping global warming below 2 {\deg}C
throughout the 21st century should be compatible also with moderate and
pragmatic shared socioeconomic pathways such as the SSP2-4.5.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08674v1
Granger causal inference for climate change attribution,2024-08-13T18:55:07Z,"Mark D. Risser, Mohammed Ombadi, Michael F. Wehner","Climate change detection and attribution (D&A) is concerned with determining
the extent to which anthropogenic activities have influenced specific aspects
of the global climate system. D&A fits within the broader field of causal
inference, the collection of statistical methods that identify cause and effect
relationships. There are a wide variety of methods for making attribution
statements, each of which require different types of input data and focus on
different types of weather and climate events and each of which are conditional
to varying extents. Some methods are based on Pearl causality while others
leverage Granger causality, and the causal framing provides important context
for how the resulting attribution conclusion should be interpreted. However,
while Granger-causal attribution analyses have become more common, there is no
clear statement of their strengths and weaknesses and no clear consensus on
where and when Granger-causal perspectives are appropriate. In this prospective
paper, we provide a formal definition for Granger-based approaches to trend and
event attribution and a clear comparison with more traditional methods for
assessing the human influence on extreme weather and climate events. Broadly
speaking, Granger-causal attribution statements can be constructed quickly from
observations and do not require computationally-intesive dynamical experiments.
These analyses also enable rapid attribution, which is useful in the aftermath
of a severe weather event, and provide multiple lines of evidence for
anthropogenic climate change when paired with Pearl-causal attribution.
Confidence in attribution statements is increased when different methodologies
arrive at similar conclusions. Moving forward, we encourage the D&A community
to embrace hybrid approaches to climate change attribution that leverage the
strengths of both Granger and Pearl causality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16004v1
The Economics of Climate Adaptation: An Assessment,2024-11-25T19:57:14Z,"Anna Josephson, Rodrigo Guerra Su, Greg Collins, Katharine Jacobs","The cost of the impacts of climate change have already proven to be larger

literature on the economic case for climate adaptation, with the objective of
assessing the value (economic and otherwise) of climate change adaptation, as
well as the strength of the methods and evidence that have been used to date.
We find that skepticism is warranted about many of the estimates about costs
and benefits of climate adaptation and their underlying assumptions, due to a
range of complexities associated with (1) uncertainty in distinguishing the
economic impacts of climate change from seasonal variability; (2) difficulties
in non-market valuation; (3) lack of consistent data collection over time at
multiple scales; and (4) distributional inequities in access to proactive
adaptation and recovery funding. While useful for broad stroke advocacy
purposes, these estimates fall short of the refinement and rigor needed to
inform investment decision-making, particularly at micro and local scales. Most
estimates rely on cost benefit analysis and do not effectively address these
issues. An emergent and promising literature tackles alternative estimation
strategies and attempts to address some of them, including the complexities of

initial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model
(hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection of
equilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels of
CO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios with
CO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training.
  ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sample
and out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergent
time-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change with
CO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile of
atmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates up to the
99.9999th percentile closely agree with the reference model.
Non-equilibrium-climate inference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing
gradually at a rate of 2% year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the
global annual mean trends of surface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but
produces unphysical jumps in stratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling
of CO$_2$, ML-controlled fields transition unrealistically quickly to the
4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing so they violate global energy conservation and
exhibit unphysical sensitivities of and surface and top of atmosphere radiative

development of a quantitative, causal understanding of why people approach
activism. In this work, we develop a comprehensive causal model of how and why
Reddit users engage with activist communities driving mass climate protests

data (2016 to 2022) to jointly model the roles of sociodemographic makeup,
experience of extreme weather events, exposure to climate-related news, and
social influence through online interactions. We find that among users

simulations were completed using different driving data. On the first hand, a
recent present (1980-2017) simulation driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis was
carried out to evaluate the suitability of the RCM performance. On the other
hand, two global climate models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 initiative, the CCSM4 and

the results pointed out the WRF model as a valuable tool to study the
spatiotemporal patterns of the SFCEVP in the IP, showing an overall and
acceptable ability at different spatial and temporal scales. Concerning
projections, the results indicate that the IP is likely to undergo significant
changes in the SFCEVP in the near future. These changes will be more apparent
over the southernmost, and particularly during spring and summer, being in the
latter season the SFCEVP fundamentally reduced. These results agree with

self-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not
consider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively
dis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive
advantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the
greatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact
of climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a

aforementioned radiatively active processes. The CLRF can then be decomposed
into forcing-response mode pairs which are in turn used to construct a
reduced-order model (ROM) describing the dominant dynamics of climate

"Impacts of Climate Change on Mortality: An extrapolation of temperature
  effects based on time series data in France",2024-06-04T07:37:31Z,"Quentin Guibert, Gaëlle Pincemin, Frédéric Planchet","Most contemporary mortality models rely on extrapolating trends or past
events. However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate
change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected
mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a
stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting
mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or
insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to
disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate
models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional
mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data
stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing
climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains
and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality
induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk
factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical
differences across the Metropolitan France.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02054v3

The future of offshore wind power production: wake and climate impacts,2024-08-27T11:10:37Z,"Simon C Warder, Matthew D Piggott","Rapid deployment of offshore wind is expected within the coming decades to
help meet climate goals. With offshore wind turbine lifetimes of 25-30 years,
and new offshore leases spanning 60 years, it is vital to consider long-term
changes in potential wind power resource at the farm planning stage. Such
changes may arise from multiple sources, including climate change, and
increasing wake-induced power losses. In this work, we investigate and compare
these two sources of long-term change in wind power, for a case study
consisting of 21 wind farms within the German Bight. Consistent with previous
studies, we find a small but significant reduction in wind resource due to
climate change by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission RCP8.5
scenario, compared with a historical period, with a mean power reduction (over
an ensemble of seven climate models) of 2.1%. To assess the impact of
wake-induced losses due to increasingly dense farm build-out, we model wakes
within the German Bight region using an engineering wake model, under various
stages of (planned) build-out corresponding to the years 2010-2027. By
identifying clusters of wind farms, we decompose wake effects into long-range
(inter-cluster), medium-range (intra-cluster) and short-range (intra-farm)
effects. Inter-cluster wake-induced losses increase from 0 for the 2010
scenario to 2.5% for the 2027 scenario, with intra-cluster losses also
increasing from 0 to 4.3%. Intra-farm losses are relatively constant, at around
13%. While the evolution of wake effects therefore outweighs the climate
effect, and impacts over a shorter timescale, both factors are significant. We
also find evidence of an interaction between the climate and wake effects. Both
climate change and evolving wake effects must therefore be considered within

Process models account for dormancy stages and various phenology drivers, while

simulate the Earth's climate system. ESMs provide a framework to integrate
various physical systems, but their output is bound by the enormous
computational resources required for running and archiving higher-resolution

policies to enact impactful change. Decisions in this domain are incredibly
complex, involving conflicting entities and evidence. In the last decades,
policymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide
some of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such
methods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to
forecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for
their recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.
Traditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have
several shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty.
Recent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the
traditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and
noisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL
agents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of
socio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of

terms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon
introducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward
functions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached. Modelling competition

"Capturing Climatic Variability: Using Deep Learning for Stochastic
  Downscaling",2024-05-31T03:04:10Z,"Kiri Daust, Adam Monahan","Adapting to the changing climate requires accurate local climate information,
a computationally challenging problem. Recent studies have used Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), a type of deep learning, to learn complex
distributions and downscale climate variables efficiently. Capturing
variability while downscaling is crucial for estimating uncertainty and
characterising extreme events - critical information for climate adaptation.
Since downscaling is an undetermined problem, many fine-scale states are
physically consistent with the coarse-resolution state. To quantify this
ill-posed problem, downscaling techniques should be stochastic, able to sample
realisations from a high-resolution distribution conditioned on low-resolution
input. Previous stochastic downscaling attempts have found substantial
underdispersion, with models failing to represent the full distribution. We
propose approaches to improve the stochastic calibration of GANs in three ways:
a) injecting noise inside the network, b) adjusting the training process to
explicitly account for the stochasticity, and c) using a probabilistic loss
metric. We tested our models first on a synthetic dataset with known
distributional properties, and then on a realistic downscaling scenario,
predicting high-resolution wind components from low-resolution climate
covariates. Injecting noise, on its own, substantially improved the quality of
conditional and full distributions in tests with synthetic data, but performed
less well for wind field downscaling, where models remained underdispersed. For
wind downscaling, we found that adjusting the training method and including the
probabilistic loss improved calibration. The best model, with all three
changes, showed much improved skill at capturing the full variability of the
high-resolution distribution and thus at characterising extremes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02587v1

  Projections using Deep Learning",2024-11-27T22:55:48Z,"Reetam Majumder, Shiqi Fang, A. Sankarasubramanian, Emily C. Hector, Brian J. Reich","Global Climate Models (GCMs) are numerical models that simulate complex
physical processes within the Earth's climate system and are essential for
understanding and predicting climate change. However, GCMs suffer from systemic
biases due to simplifications made to the underlying physical processes. GCM
output therefore needs to be bias corrected before it can be used for future
climate projections. Most common bias correction methods, however, cannot
preserve spatial, temporal, or inter-variable dependencies. We propose a new
semi-parametric conditional density estimation (SPCDE) for density correction
of the joint distribution of daily precipitation and maximum temperature data
obtained from gridded GCM spatial fields. The Vecchia approximation is employed
to preserve dependencies in the observed field during the density correction
process, which is carried out using semi-parametric quantile regression. The
ability to calibrate joint distributions of GCM projections has potential
advantages not only in estimating extremes, but also in better estimating
compound hazards, like heat waves and drought, under potential climate change.
Illustration on historical data from 1951-2014 over two 5x5 spatial grids in
the US indicate that SPCDE can preserve key marginal and joint distribution
properties of precipitation and maximum temperature, and predictions obtained
using SPCDE are better calibrated compared to predictions using asynchronous

contribute to accelerated climate change. As wildfires are also affected by
climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although
they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities,
lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and
account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing
computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to
predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific
regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In
this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and
predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves
classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating
with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a
wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation.
Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in
lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on
this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models
using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings
highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and

first map global offshore ambient wind resource from reanalysis data. We
estimate wake-induced losses using an engineering wake model, revealing that
locations with low (high) resource typically experience larger (smaller)
percentage losses. However, we further find that the specific wind speed
distribution is important, with narrower distributions generally leading to
greater losses. This is due to the overlap between the wind speed distribution
and the high-sensitivity region of the turbine thrust and power curves.
Broadly, this leads to much stronger wake-induced losses in the tropics (which
experience the trade winds) than mid-latitudes. However, the tropics also
experience a narrower wind direction distribution; our results demonstrate that
this leads to greater potential for mitigation of wake effects via layout
optimisation. Finally, we assess projected changes in wind resource and wake
losses due to climate change under a high-emission scenario. Many regions are
projected to decrease in ambient wind resources, and furthermore these regions
will typically experience greater wake-induced losses, exacerbating the climate
impact. These results highlight the different challenges and opportunities

Mapping climate change awareness through spatial hierarchical clustering,2024-09-16T12:03:25Z,"Gianpaolo Zammarchi, Paolo Maranzano","Climate change is a critical issue that will be in the political agenda for
the next decades. While it is important for this topic to be discussed at
higher levels, it is also of paramount importance that the populations became
aware of the problem. As different countries may face more or less severe
repercussions, it is also useful to understand the degree of awareness of
specific populations. In this paper, we present a geographically-informed
hierarchical clustering analysis aimed at identify groups of countries with a
similar level of climate change awareness. We employ a Ward-like clustering
algorithm that combines information pertaining climate change awareness,
socio-economic factors, climate-related characteristics of different countries,

clustering hyperparameters, we propose a customized algorithm that takes into
account the within-clusters homogeneity, the between-clusters separation and
that explicitly compares the geographically-informed and non-geographical

provides more stability of the partitions and leads to interpretable and

change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km
remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which
need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a
major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate
projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from
computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great
promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of
interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations
result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient
supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to
physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible
computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key
features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently,
the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show
empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as

interception, lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration, and controlling net
radiation and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes. This
influence propagates through the atmosphere, from microclimate scales to the
entire atmospheric boundary layer, subsequently impacting large-scale
circulation and the global transport of heat and moisture. Understanding the

organisations, identifying and assessing climate-related risks is challenging,
as they can come from multiple sources. This study identifies and assesses the
main climate transition risks in the colombian processed food sector. As
transition risks are vague, our approach uses Fuzzy Logic and compares it to
various multi-criteria decision-making methods to classify the different
climate transition risks an organisation may be exposed to. This approach
allows us to use linguistic expressions for risk analysis and to better
describe risks and their consequences. The results show that the risks ranked
as the most critical for this organisation in their order were price volatility
and raw materials availability, the change to less carbon-intensive production
or consumption patterns, the increase in carbon taxes and technological change,
and the associated development or implementation costs. These risks show a
critical risk level, which implies that they are the most significant risks for
the organisation in the case study. These results highlight the importance of

"Feedback Processes causing an AMOC Collapse in the Community Earth
  System Model",2024-10-04T09:00:22Z,"Elian Vanderborght, René M. van Westen, Henk A. Dijkstra","The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is recognized as a
tipping element within the global climate system. Central to its tipping
behavior is the salt-advection feedback mechanism, which has been extensively
studied in box models and models of intermediate complexity. However, in
contemporary, highly complex climate models, the importance and functioning of
this feedback mechanism is less clear due to the intricate interplay of
numerous ocean-atmosphere-sea ice feedbacks. In this study, we conduct a
detailed mechanistic analysis of an AMOC collapse under quasi-equilibrium
forcing conditions using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). By
reconstructing the AMOC strength from the meridional density contrast across
the Atlantic Ocean, we demonstrate that AMOC stability can be related to the
Atlantic freshwater budget, revealing several important feedbacks. The dominant
contribution is the destabilising salt-advection feedback, which is quantified
through a negative sign of the overturning freshwater transport at
34$^{\circ}$S, indicated by $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$. Other feedbacks are related to
changes in North Atlantic sea-ice melt (destabilising), ocean-atmosphere
freshwater fluxes (destabilising) and gyre transports (stabilising). Our study
clarifies the role of $F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ as an indicator of the background
state stability of the AMOC. As many modern climate models have a positive
$F_{\mathrm{ovS}}$ bias this implies that their AMOC is too stable which leads
to an underestimation of the risk of an AMOC collapse under climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03236v1

  records",2024-04-21T05:53:27Z,Ian R. Edmonds,"Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked
and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal
strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for
variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral
content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as
resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year
period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible
with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is
frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on
an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the
Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar
cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which
is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed
spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has
been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible
to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single
frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year
period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely
with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate
variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal
spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method
to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate
records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar
cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and
assessing the Sun climate connection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13542v1

Generative Adversarial Models for Extreme Geospatial Downscaling,2024-02-21T18:25:04Z,"Guiye Li, Guofeng Cao","Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and
high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather
variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded
outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general
circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due
to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand.
Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images
and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper
describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that
can accommodates very high scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods,
the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very
low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the
uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in
existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of
plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result.
These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model
uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind
velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the
framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to $64\times$)

dominant land cover types (evergreen forest, shrubs, and grassland) in the
Pacific Northwest region. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
data, we estimated vegetation recovery by calculating the incremental enhanced
vegetation index (EVI) change during post-fire years. A machine learning
technique, random forest (RF), was employed to map relationships between the
input features (elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, temperature, burn
severity, and years after fire) and the target (incremental EVI recovery) for
each land cover type. Variable importance analysis and partial dependence plots
were generated to understand the influence of individual features. The observed
and predicted incremental EVI values showed good matches, with R2 values of
0.99 for training and between 0.89 and 0.945 for testing. The study found that
climate variables, specifically precipitation and temperature, were the most
important features overall, while elevation played the most significant role
among the topographic factors. Partial dependence plots revealed that lower
precipitation tended to cause a reduction in vegetation recovery for varying
temperature ranges across land cover types. These findings can aid in
developing targeted strategies for post-wildfire forest management, considering

episodes during which the long eccentricity cycle is very weak or absent and
Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable

amplitude modulation (frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide

language models that synthesize interdisciplinary research on climate change.
We trained two 7B models from scratch on a science-oriented dataset of 300B
tokens. For the first model, the 4.2B domain-specific tokens were included
during pre-training and the second was adapted to the climate domain after
pre-training. Additionally, ClimateGPT-7B, 13B and 70B are continuously
pre-trained from Llama~2 on a domain-specific dataset of 4.2B tokens. Each
model is instruction fine-tuned on a high-quality and human-generated
domain-specific dataset that has been created in close cooperation with climate
scientists. To reduce the number of hallucinations, we optimize the model for
retrieval augmentation and propose a hierarchical retrieval strategy. To
increase the accessibility of our model to non-English speakers, we propose to
make use of cascaded machine translation and show that this approach can
perform comparably to natively multilingual models while being easier to scale
to a large number of languages. Further, to address the intrinsic
interdisciplinary aspect of climate change we consider different research
perspectives. Therefore, the model can produce in-depth answers focusing on
different perspectives in addition to an overall answer. We propose a suite of
automatic climate-specific benchmarks to evaluate LLMs. On these benchmarks,
ClimateGPT-7B performs on par with the ten times larger Llama-2-70B Chat model

between dry and wet climates, the Iberian Peninsula (IP). With this purpose,
the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, driven CCSM4 and MPI-ESM-LR
GCMs previously bias-corrected, was used. Simulations were carried out for two
periods, 1980-2014 and 2071-2100, and under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The analysis
focused on changes in land-surface processes, their causes, and the potential
impact on the climate system. To achieve this, seasonal projected changes of
land-surface (soil moisture and surface evapotranspiration) and atmospheric
variables involved in the hydrologic (precipitation and runoff) and energy
balance (temperature and solar incoming radiation) were investigated. The
results reveal that the IP is likely to experience a soil dryness by the end of
the 21st century, particularly during summer and fall, more apparent in the
southern IP, and stronger under the RCP8.5. However, such trends would have
different implications throughout the year and directly affect the surface
evapotranspiration. Moreover, soil-drying trends are mainly associated with
reductions in the large-scale precipitation during spring, summer, and fall and
by enhanced evapotranspiration particularly in spring over the northwestern IP.
In addition, the results show notably changes in soil conditions at high
altitude, particularly during winter, which may alter the land-atmosphere
processes that currently occur in these regions. In this context, noteworthy
changes in the climate system are expected, leading to adverse impacts on water
resources and temperature. The results highlight the complex and nonlinear
nature of land-atmosphere interactions in regions such as the IP, which is a
tremendous challenge for adequately developing mitigation and adaptation
strategies to anthropogenic climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10164v1
Towards A Comprehensive Assessment of AI's Environmental Impact,2024-05-22T21:19:35Z,Srija Chakraborty,"Artificial Intelligence, machine learning (AI/ML) has allowed exploring
solutions for a variety of environmental and climate questions ranging from
natural disasters, greenhouse gas emission, monitoring biodiversity,
agriculture, to weather and climate modeling, enabling progress towards climate

always positive. The recent surge of interest in ML, made possible by
processing very large volumes of data, fueled by access to massive compute
power, has sparked a trend towards large-scale adoption of AI/ML. This interest
places tremendous pressure on natural resources, that are often overlooked and

policymakers, stakeholders to adequately implement standards and policies and
track the policy outcome over time. For these policies to be effective, AI's
environmental impact needs to be monitored in a spatially-disaggregated, timely
manner across the globe at the key activity sites. This study proposes a
methodology to track environmental variables relating to the multifaceted
impact of AI around datacenters using openly available energy data and globally

meteorological scenarios to explore the impacts of both average climatic
changes and the intensification of extreme weather events. We find that
addressing extreme weather in power system planning will require an extra 5-8
GW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity, on top of the 50 GW of the additional solar
PV capacity required by the mitigation target alone. Despite the higher initial
investments, we find that the adoption of renewable technologies, especially

aridity index, and rooting depth as predictors, achieved an R2 of 0.66 and a

Regional differences were observed, with higher ET increases in mid-to-high
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and decreases in some mid-to-low latitudes
and the Southern Hemisphere. In drylands, ET and temperature were weakly
correlated, while in humid areas, the correlation was much higher. The
correlation between ET and precipitation has remained stable over the

spread in future rainfall changes in the tropical Atlantic by the end of the

(ITCZ) and monsoonal regions. While existing studies have identified various
sources of uncertainty, our research uncovers a prominent role played by the
decline of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the
inter-model spread. Firstly we examine 30 climate model simulations (using the
ssp5-8.5 scenario) from the CMIP6 archive and show that models that present a
more substantial AMOC decline exhibit an equatorward shift of the ascending
branch of the Atlantic regional Hadley circulation, resulting in a southward
displacement of the ITCZ. Conversely, models characterized by a smaller AMOC
decline do not indicate any ITCZ displacement. Secondly, we use targeted
experiments (using the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment) to specifically isolate the
effects of a weakened AMOC from the changes in precipitation that would occur
if, under continuous global warming, the AMOC did not weaken. Our results
demonstrate that net precipitation anomalies in the abrupt 4xCO2 experiments

  Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning",2024-03-05T08:41:41Z,"Philipp Hess, Michael Aich, Baoxiang Pan, Niklas Boers","Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are
essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic
climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently
high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown
promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming
state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require
computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to
climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a
consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM
simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields
probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the
observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art

weather is expected to increase over the coming decades. As fully-resolved
climate simulations remain computationally intractable, policy makers must rely
on coarse-models to quantify risk for extremes. However, coarse models suffer
from inherent bias due to the ignored ""sub-grid"" scales. We propose a framework
to non-intrusively debias coarse-resolution climate predictions using
neural-network (NN) correction operators. Previous efforts have attempted to
train such operators using loss functions that match statistics. However, this
approach falls short with events that have longer return period than that of
the training data, since the reference statistics have not converged. Here, the
scope is to formulate a learning method that allows for correction of dynamics

where the correction operator is trained using reference data and a coarse
model simulation nudged towards that reference. The method is demonstrated on
debiasing an under-resolved quasi-geostrophic model and the Energy Exascale
Earth System Model (E3SM). For the former, our method enables the
quantification of events that have return period two orders longer than the

"Carbon cycle instability for high-$\mathrm{CO_2}$ exoplanets:
  Implications for habitability",2024-05-08T19:55:13Z,"R. J. Graham, R. T. Pierrehumbert","Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ)
is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement
climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of
instellations by adjusting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ partial pressure
($p\mathrm{CO_2}$). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but
it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on
planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than
those received by even the Archean Earth and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is thought likely
to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to
ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the
hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like
conditions. Here, we use global climate model (GCM) simulations to demonstrate
that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on
planets with $\mathrm{CO_2}$-$\mathrm{H_2O}$ atmospheres at low instellations
and high $p\mathrm{CO_2}$, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing
as $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within
the MAC weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing
$p\mathrm{CO_2}$ for a range of instellations and $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ typical of
the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may
lead to either runaway $\mathrm{CO_2}$ accumulation or depletion of
$\mathrm{CO_2}$ to colder (possibly Snowball) conditions. While the behavior of
the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that
silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer
reaches of the nominal HZ.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05396v1
How optimal control of polar sea-ice depends on its tipping points,2024-07-24T15:29:20Z,"Parvathi Kooloth, Jian Lu, Craig Bakker, Derek DeSantis, Adam Rupe","Several Earth system components are at a high risk of undergoing rapid and
irreversible qualitative changes or `tipping', due to increasing climate
warming. Potential tipping elements include Arctic sea-ice, Atlantic meridional
overturning circulation, and tropical coral reefs. Amidst such immediate
concerns, it has become necessary to investigate the feasibility of arresting
or even reversing the crossing of tipping thresholds using feedback control. In
this paper, we study the control of an idealized diffusive energy balance model
(EBM) for the Earth's climate; this model has two tipping points due to strong
co-albedo feedback. One of these tipping points is a `small icecap' instability
responsible for a rapid transition to an ice-free climate state under
increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. We develop an optimal control strategy
for the EBM under different climate forcing scenarios with the goal of
reversing sea ice loss while minimizing costs. We find that effective control
is achievable for such a system, but the cost of reversing sea-ice loss nearly
quadruples for an initial state that has just tipped as compared to a state
before reaching the tipping point. We also show that thermal inertia may delay
tipping leading to an overshoot of the critical GHG forcing threshold. This may
offer a short intervention window (overshoot window) during which the control
required to reverse sea-ice loss only scales linearly with intervention time.
While systems with larger system inertia may have longer overshoot windows,
this increased elbow room comes with a steeper rise in the requisite control
once the intervention is delayed past this window. Additionally, we find that
the requisite control to restore sea-ice is localized in the polar region.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17357v1

demographic groups. In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is
predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data)
and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the
year 2100. The HeatPath Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to
predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35,999 trip
equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The
analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were

demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to
accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age

indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist,
particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By
showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted

Origin and Limits of Invariant Warming Patterns in Climate Models,2024-11-21T14:47:44Z,"Paolo Giani, Arlene M. Fiore, Glenn Flierl, Raffaele Ferrari, Noelle E. Selin","Climate models exhibit an approximately invariant surface warming pattern in
typical end-of-century projections. This observation has been used extensively
in climate impact assessments for fast calculations of local temperature
anomalies, with a linear procedure known as pattern scaling. At the same time,
emerging research has also shown that time-varying warming patterns are
necessary to explain the time evolution of effective climate sensitivity in
coupled models, a mechanism that is known as the pattern effect and that
seemingly challenges the pattern scaling understanding. Here we present a
simple theory based on local energy balance arguments to reconcile this
apparent contradiction. Specifically, we show that the pattern invariance is an
inherent feature of exponential forcing, linear feedbacks, a constant forcing
pattern and diffusive dynamics. These conditions are approximately met in most
CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), except in the Arctic where nonlinear
feedbacks are important and in regions where aerosols considerably alter the
forcing pattern. In idealized experiments where concentrations of CO2 are
abruptly increased, such as those used to study the pattern effect, the warming
pattern can change considerably over time because of spatially inhomogeneous
ocean heat uptake, even in the absence of nonlinear feedbacks. Our results
illustrate why typical future projections are amenable to pattern scaling, and
provide a plausible explanation of why more complicated approaches, such as
nonlinear emulators, have only shown marginal improvements in accuracy over
simple linear calculations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14183v1

of stochastic chaos and complexity for which the jump-diffusion processes are a
powerful tool to parameterize the missing physics or effects of the unresolved
scales onto the resolved ones.
  By generalizing concepts such as Kolmogorov operators and Green's functions
to this context, we derive fluctuation-dissipation relationships for such

from the eigenmodes of the Kolmogorov operator (Kolmogorov modes) decomposing
the time-lagged correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. The
underlying formulas offer a fresh look on the intimate relationships between
the system's natural variability and its forced variability.
  We apply our theory to a paradigmatic El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
subject to state-dependent jumps and additive white noise parameterizing
intermittent and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, key factors in the actual ENSO
phenomenon. Such stochastic parameterizations are shown to produce stochastic
chaos with an enriched time-variability. The Kolmogorov modes encoding the
latter are then computed, and our Green's functions formulas are shown to
achieve a remarkable accuracy to predict the system's response to
perturbations.
  This work enriches Hasselmann's program by providing a more comprehensive

focusing on historical hotspots, and our approach demonstrates better
performance compared to traditional numerical models in regions such as the
middle south Pacific, equatorial Atlantic near Africa, south Atlantic, and
high-latitude Indian Ocean. We highlight the potential of temporal diffusion to

informed timely decisions. To achieve this goal, we propose a method to
calculate the probability of breaching the limits set out by the Paris

different scenarios and calculating the number of possible outcomes that breach
the limits as a proportion of the total number of outcomes. The probabilities

this investigation decomposed changes in coastal water levels into its
fundamental components to predict maximum water levels for a given coastal

located near the coast of Miami. Hourly mean lower low water (MLLW) levels were
obtained from the National Data Buoy Center from January 28, 1994, through
December 31, 2023. In the temporal dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filters were
used to extract long-term trends, annual and daily tides, and higher frequency
harmonics, while in the spectral dimension, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms
with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing were used to confirm known tidal
frequencies and periods. A linear model predicted that the long-term trend in
water level will rise 2.02 feet from January 1994 to December 2050, while a
quadratic model predicted a rise of 5.91 during the same period. In addition,
the combined crests of annual tides, daily tides, and higher frequency
harmonics increase water levels up to 2.16 feet, yielding a combined total of
4.18 feet as a lower bound and a combined total of 8.09 feet as an upper bound.
These findings provide a foundation for more accurate prediction of coastal
flooding during severe weather events and provide an impetus for policy choices

  Deployment of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection",2024-02-19T09:35:18Z,"Ezra Brody, Daniele Visioni, Ewa M. Bednarz, Ben Kravitz, Douglas G. MacMartin, Jadwiga H. Richter, Mari R. Tye","Climate change is a prevalent threat, and it is unlikely that current
mitigation efforts will be enough to avoid unwanted impacts. One potential
option to reduce climate change impacts is the use of stratospheric aerosol
injection (SAI). Even if SAI is ultimately deployed, it might be initiated only
after some temperature target is exceeded. The consequences of such a delay are
assessed herein. This study compares two cases, with the same target global
mean temperature of 1.5C above preindustrial, but start dates of 2035 or a
delayed start in 2045. We make use of simulations in the Community Earth System
Model version 2 with the Whole Atmosphere Coupled Chemistry Model version 6
(CESM2-WACCM6), using SAI under the SSP2-4.5 emissions pathway. We find that
delaying the start of deployment (relative to the target temperature)
necessitates lower net radiative forcing (-30%) and thus larger sulfur dioxide
injection rates (+20%), even after surface temperatures converge, to compensate
for the extra energy absorbed by the Earth system. However, many of the surface
climate differences between the 2035 and 2045 start simulations appear to be
small during the 10-25 years following the delayed SAI start, although longer
simulations would be needed to assess any longer-term impacts in this model. In
addition, irreversibilities and tipping points that might be triggered during
the period of increased warming may not be adequately represented in the model
but could change this conclusion in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11992v1

used to simulate, for the period 1959-2015, the forage production of a mown

management conditions, with meteorological inputs extracted from the SAFRAN
atmospheric database. The aim was to generate purely climate-dependent
timeseries of optimal forage production, a variable that was maximized by
brighter and warmer weather conditions at the grassland. A long-term increase
was observed in simulated forage yield, with the 1995-2015 average being 29%
higher than the 1959-1979 average. Such increase seems consistent with observed
rising trends in temperature and CO2, and multi-decadal changes in incident
solar radiation. At interannual timescales, sea surface temperature anomalies
of the Mediterranean (MED), Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), equatorial Pacific

burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to
climate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing
challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep
understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the
use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a
framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior
research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the
hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for
policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse
six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax,
Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our
findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing
emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide
additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence
supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally,
we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming

CO2 emission trends and classify countries based on their emission patterns to
effectively mitigate worldwide carbon emission. This paper presents an in-depth
comparative study on the determinants of CO2 emission in twenty countries with
high Human Development Index (HDI), exploring factors related to economy,

Reconciling risk-based and storyline attribution with Bayes theorem,2024-07-15T14:55:17Z,"Sebastian Buschow, Petra Friederichs, Andreas Hense","The question to what extent climate change is responsible for extreme weather
events has been at the forefront of public and scholarly discussion for years.
Proponents of the ""risk-based"" approach to attribution attempt to give an
unconditional answer based on the probability of some class of events in a
world with and without human influences. As an alternative, so-called
""storyline"" studies investigate the impact of a warmer world on a single,
specific weather event. This can be seen as a conditional attribution
statement. In this study, we connect conditional to unconditional attribution
using Bayes theorem: in essence, the conditional statement is composed of two
unconditional statements, one based on all available data (event and
conditions) and one based on the conditions alone. We explore the effects of
the conditioning in a simple statistical toy model and a real-world attribution
of European summer temperatures conditional on blocking. The resulting
attribution statement is generally strengthened if the conditions are not
affected by climate change. Conversely, if part of the trend is contained in
the conditions, a weaker attribution statement may result.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10776v1

extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our
results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise
tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in
intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and
assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings

climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution
studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes
this task a challenging one, even more so for ""record-shattering"" events that
have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to
simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge
computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of
centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows
to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct
simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons,
corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a
heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show
that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with
much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the
computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated
through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results
reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic
anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary
wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the
intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering
insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave

that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological

Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small
environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain
that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization
effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis.
Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne
for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC
cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC
costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's
DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning
cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in
Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC
identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced
by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in
cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning
by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate
change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale
have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology

"Deep Learning for Hydroelectric Optimization: Generating Long-Term River
  Discharge Scenarios with Ensemble Forecasts from Global Circulation Models",2024-12-16T16:37:27Z,Julio Alberto Silva Dias,"Hydroelectric power generation is a critical component of the global energy
matrix, particularly in countries like Brazil, where it represents the majority
of the energy supply. However, its strong dependence on river discharges, which
are inherently uncertain due to climate variability, poses significant
challenges. River discharges are linked to precipitation patterns, making the
development of accurate probabilistic forecasting models crucial for improving
operational planning in systems heavily reliant on this resource.
Traditionally, statistical models have been used to represent river discharges
in energy optimization. Yet, these models are increasingly unable to produce
realistic scenarios due to structural shifts in climate behavior. Changes in
precipitation patterns have altered discharge dynamics, which traditional
approaches struggle to capture. Machine learning methods, while effective as
universal predictors for time series, often focus solely on historical data,
ignoring key external factors such as meteorological and climatic conditions.
Furthermore, these methods typically lack a probabilistic framework, which is
vital for representing the inherent variability of hydrological processes. The
limited availability of historical discharge data further complicates the
application of large-scale deep learning models to this domain. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework based on a modified recurrent neural
network architecture. This model generates parameterized probability
distributions conditioned on projections from global circulation models,
effectively accounting for the stochastic nature of river discharges.
Additionally, the architecture incorporates enhancements to improve its
generalization capabilities. We validate this framework within the Brazilian
Interconnected System, using projections from the SEAS5-ECMWF system as
conditional variables.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12234v1

explored for storyline-based climate attribution due to their short inference
times, which can accelerate the number of events studied, and provide real time
attributions when public attention is heightened. The analysis is framed on the
extreme atmospheric river episode of February 2017 that contributed to the
Oroville dam spillway incident in Northern California. Past and future
simulations are generated by perturbing the initial conditions with the
pre-industrial and the late-21st century temperature climate change signals,
respectively. The simulations are compared to results from a dynamical model
which represents plausible pseudo-realities under both climate environments.
Overall, the AI models show promising results, projecting a 5-6 % increase in
the integrated water vapor over the Oroville dam in the present day compared to
the pre-industrial, in agreement with the dynamical model. Different
geopotential-moisture-temperature dependencies are unveiled for each of the
AI-models tested, providing valuable information for understanding the
physicality of the attribution response. However, the AI models tend to
simulate weaker attribution values than the pseudo-reality imagined by the
dynamical model, suggesting some reduced extrapolation skill, especially for
the late-21st century regime. Large ensembles generated with an AI model (>500
members) produced statistically significant present-day to pre-industrial
attribution results, unlike the >20-member ensemble from the dynamical model.

which will call for more production, lower costs, and the preservation of
natural resources. It is anticipated that atypical occurrences and climate
change will pose severe risks to agricultural output. It follows that a 70% or
more significant rise in food output is anticipated. Smart farming, often known
as agriculture 4.0, is a tech-driven revolution in agriculture with the goal of
raising industry production and efficiency. Four primary trends are responsible
for it: food waste, climate change, population shifts, and resource scarcity.
The agriculture industry is changing as a result of the adoption of emerging
technologies. Using cutting-edge technology like IoT, AI, and other sensors,
smart farming transforms traditional production methods and international
agricultural policies. The objective is to establish a value chain that is
optimized to facilitate enhanced monitoring and decreased labor expenses. The
agricultural sector has seen tremendous transformation as a result of the
fourth industrial revolution, which has combined traditional farming methods
with cutting-edge technology to increase productivity, sustainability, and
efficiency. To effectively utilize the potential of technology gadgets in the
agriculture sector, collaboration between governments, private sector entities,

contemporary adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated the
contemporary evolution of four populations of the cold-water kelp Laminaria
digitata by analysing their spatial and temporal genomic variation using
ddRAD-sequencing. These populations were sampled from the center to the
southern margin of its north-eastern Atlantic distribution at two-time points,
spanning at least two generations. Through genome scans for local adaptation at
a single time point, we identified candidate loci that showed clinal variation
correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) along latitudinal
gradients. This finding suggests that SST may drive the adaptive response of
these kelp populations, although factors such as species' demographic history
should also be considered. Additionally, we performed a simulation approach to
distinguish the effect of selection from genetic drift in allele frequency
changes over time. This enabled the detection of loci in the southernmost
population that exhibited temporal differentiation beyond what would be
expected from genetic drift alone: these are candidate loci which could have
evolved under selection over time. In contrast, we did not detect any outlier
locus based on temporal differentiation in the population from the North Sea,
which also displayed low and decreasing levels of genetic diversity. The
diverse evolutionary scenarios observed among populations can be attributed to
variations in the prevalence of selection relative to genetic drift across
different environments. Therefore, our study highlights the potential of
temporal genomics to offer valuable insights into the contemporary evolution of
marine foundation species facing climate change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14003v1

changes, significantly impact regions on the leeward side of mountain ranges,
e.g., by spreading wildfires. Understanding how foehn occurrences change under
climate change is crucial. Unfortunately, foehn cannot be measured directly but
has to be inferred from meteorological measurements employing suitable
classification schemes. Hence, this approach is typically limited to specific
periods for which the necessary data are available. We present a novel approach
for reconstructing historical foehn occurrences using a combination of
unsupervised and supervised probabilistic statistical learning methods. We
utilize in-situ measurements (available for recent decades) to train an
unsupervised learner (finite mixture model) for automatic foehn classification.
These labeled data are then linked to reanalysis data (covering longer periods)
using a supervised learner (lasso or boosting). This allows to reconstruct past
foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to
ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves
accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence,

that when considered in the context of the long-term trend over the last

appear exceptional. Both the yearly means and the number of episodes with
extreme values for this period are within the one standard deviation of the
long-term trends. We conclude that the spatially and temporally very localized
reductions do not add up to statistically significant reductions in the global

  Environment: Analysis of GGDP based on SEEA model",2024-09-04T12:19:11Z,Mingpu Ma,"This paper presents an analysis of Green Gross Domestic Product (GGDP) using
the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) model to evaluate its
impact on global climate mitigation and economic health. GGDP is proposed as a
superior measure to tradi-tional GDP by incorporating natural resource
consumption, environmental pollution control, and degradation factors. The
study develops a GGDP model and employs grey correlation analysis and grey
prediction models to assess its relationship with these factors. Key findings
demonstrate that replacing GDP with GGDP can positively influence climate
change, partic-ularly in reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing global
temperatures. The analysis further explores the implications of GGDP adoption
across developed and developing countries, with specific predictions for China
and the United States. The results indicate a potential increase in economic
levels for developing countries, while developed nations may experi-ence a
decrease. Additionally, the shift to GGDP is shown to significantly reduce
natural re-source depletion and population growth rates in the United States,
suggesting broader envi-ronmental and economic benefits. This paper highlights
the universal applicability of the GGDP model and its potential to enhance
environmental and economic policies globally.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02642v1

Masked Autoregressive Model for Weather Forecasting,2024-09-30T09:17:04Z,"Doyi Kim, Minseok Seo, Hakjin Lee, Junghoon Seo","The growing impact of global climate change amplifies the need for accurate

this issue, but it struggles to maintain crucial correlations in atmospheric
events. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Masked Autoregressive
Model for Weather Forecasting (MAM4WF). This model leverages masked modeling,
where portions of the input data are masked during training, allowing the model
to learn robust spatiotemporal relationships by reconstructing the missing

traditional time-series models. Existing procedures, however, mostly consist of
testing necessary but not sufficient conditions, leading to under-rejection, or
sufficient but non-necessary ones, which leads to over-rejection. Moreover,

systematically collated and synthesized. A global evidence map of NCS
co-impacts would overcome key barriers to NCS implementation by providing
relevant information on co-benefits and trade-offs where carbon mitigation
potential alone does not justify NCS projects. We employ large language models
to assess over two million articles, finding 257,266 relevant articles on NCS

examine multiple NCS pathways, indicating natural NCS pathway complements, and
each NCS is often associated with two or more coimpacts. Finally, NCS
co-impacts evidence and priority areas for NCS are often mismatched--some

temperature (UST) and surface temperature, as well as various climate drivers

cover extent, and sea ice extent (SIE). We strikingly found warming trends of
0.77(+/-0.57) and 0.69(+/-0.22) K/decade in UST at altitudes of 35-40 km in the
Arctic and Antarctic respectively and no significant trends over non-polar
regions since 2002. These UST trends provide fingerprints of decreasing and no
significant trends in total GHG effect in polar and non-polar regions
respectively. Correspondingly, we made the first observation of surface cooling
trends in both the Antarctic since 2005 and the Arctic since 2016 once the SIE
started to recover. But surface warming remains at mid-latitudes, which causes
the recent rise in global mean surface temperature (GMST). These temperature
changing patterns are consistent with the characteristics of the
cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction (CRE) mechanism of halogen-containing GHGs
(halo-GHGs) with larger destruction rates at higher latitudes. Moreover, the
no-parameter physics model of warming caused by halo-GHGs reproduces closely
the observed GMSTs from 2000 to 2024, including the almost no warming during
2000-2012 and the significant warming by 0.2-0.3 deg C during 2013-2023, of
which 0.27 deg C was calculated to arise from the net radiative forcing of
aerosols and ozone due to improved air quality. The results also show that the
physics model captures 76% of the variance in the observed GMSTs, exhibiting a
warming peak in October 2023 and predicting a gradual GMST reversal thereafter.

energy. Daily torpor, a temporally controlled reduction of the metabolic rate

fluctuations in ambient temperature and humidity, the higher was the general
resting metabolic rate and the rate of its reduction, but the lower was the

arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation.
Adversely affected biological productivity has a negative impact on social,
economic, and environmental factors. The term 'arid ecosystems' refers not only
to water-scarce landscapes but also to nutrient-poor environments.
Specifically, the vegetation cover loses spatial homogeneity as aridity
increases, and the self-organized heterogeneous vegetation patterns developed
could eventually collapse into a bare state. It is still unclear whether this
transition would be gradual or abrupt, leading to the often-called catastrophic
shift of ecosystems. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities
in time or space can promote a gradual transition to bare soil, thus avoiding
catastrophic shifts. Environmental inhomogeneities include non-uniformities in
the spatial distribution of precipitation, spatial irregularities in topography
and other external factors. Employing a generic mathematical model including
environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation
patterns create a hysteresis loop when the effective mortality level changes.
These two branches correspond to qualitatively distinct vegetation
self-organized responses. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an
equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass forming self-organized patterns
with a well-defined wavelength. However, reversing the mortality trend, one
observes a low biomass branch lacking a wavelength. We call this phenomenon the
clustering of vegetation patches. This behavior can be connected to
historically significant trends of climate change in arid ecosystems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12581v1

temperature. This ``top-down'' approach produces an RCE state with a deeper,
drier boundary layer, which weakens convective precipitation extremes in three
distinct ways. First, the lifted condensation level is higher, leading to a
small thermodynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Second, the higher
lifted condensation level also reduces positive buoyancy in the lower
troposphere, leading to a dynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Third,
precipitation re-evaporates more readily when falling through a deeper, drier
boundary layer, leading to a substantial decrease in precipitation efficiency.
These three effects all follow from changes in near-surface relative humidity
and are physically distinct from the mechanism that underpins the
Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate. Overall, our results suggest that changes in
relative humidity must be taken into account when seeking to understand and
predict changes in convective precipitation extremes over land.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16306v1
"Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Change Detection: Novel
  Architecture and Analysis of Domain Shift",2024-07-10T12:54:51Z,"Elliot Vincent, Jean Ponce, Mathieu Aubry","Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on
Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and
disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with
satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection
and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves
over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and
leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases,
models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge.
We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global,
multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the
spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of
temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on
semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving
further attention.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07616v1
Detection of Critical Events in Renewable Energy Production Time Series,2024-01-31T13:13:37Z,"Laurens P. Stoop, Erik Duijm, Ad J. Feelders, Machteld van den Broek","The introduction of more renewable energy sources into the energy system
increases the variability and weather dependence of electricity generation.
Power system simulations are used to assess the adequacy and reliability of the
electricity grid over decades, but often become computational intractable for
such long simulation periods with high technical detail. To alleviate this
computational burden, we investigate the use of outlier detection algorithms to
find periods of extreme renewable energy generation which enables detailed
modelling of the performance of power systems under these circumstances.
Specifically, we apply the Maximum Divergent Intervals (MDI) algorithm to power
generation time series that have been derived from ERA5 historical climate
reanalysis covering the period from 1950 through 2019. By applying the MDI
algorithm on these time series, we identified intervals of extreme low and high
energy production. To determine the outlierness of an interval different
divergence measures can be used. Where the cross-entropy measure results in
shorter and strongly peaking outliers, the unbiased Kullback-Leibler divergence
tends to detect longer and more persistent intervals. These intervals are
regarded as potential risks for the electricity grid by domain experts,
showcasing the capability of the MDI algorithm to detect critical events in
these time series. For the historical period analysed, we found no trend in
outlier intensity, or shift and lengthening of the outliers that could be
attributed to climate change. By applying MDI on climate model output, power
system modellers can investigate the adequacy and possible changes of risk for
the current and future electricity grid under a wider range of scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17814v2

midcentury, there are questions about how these targets alter household welfare
and finances, including distributional effects across income groups. This paper
examines the distributional dimensions of technology transitions and net-zero
policies with a focus on welfare impacts across household incomes. The analysis
uses a model intercomparison with a range of energy-economy models using
harmonized policy scenarios reaching economy-wide, net-zero CO2 emissions
across the United States in 2050. We employ a novel linking approach that
connects output from detailed energy system models with survey microdata on
energy expenditures across income classes to provide distributional analysis of
net-zero policies. Although there are differences in model structure and input
assumptions, we find broad agreement in qualitative trends in policy incidence
and energy burdens across income groups. Models generally agree that direct
energy expenditures for many households will likely decline over time with
reference and net-zero policies. However, there is variation in the extent of
changes relative to current levels, energy burdens relative to reference
levels, and electricity expenditures. Policy design, primarily how climate
policy revenues are used, has first-order impacts on distributional outcomes.
Net-zero policy costs, in both absolute and relative terms, are unevenly
distributed across households, and relative increases in energy expenditures
are higher for lowest-income households. However, we also find that recycled
revenues from climate policies have countervailing effects when rebated on a
per-capita basis, offsetting higher energy burdens and potentially even leading
to net progressive outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18748v1

"At the junction between deep learning and statistics of extremes:
  formalizing the landslide hazard definition",2024-01-25T14:48:08Z,"Ashok Dahal, Raphaël Huser, Luigi Lombardo","The most adopted definition of landslide hazard combines spatial information
about landslide location (susceptibility), threat (intensity), and frequency
(return period). Only the first two elements are usually considered and
estimated when working over vast areas. Even then, separate models constitute
the standard, with frequency being rarely investigated. Frequency and intensity
are intertwined and depend on each other because larger events occur less
frequently and vice versa. However, due to the lack of multi-temporal
inventories and joint statistical models, modelling such properties via a
unified hazard model has always been challenging and has yet to be attempted.
Here, we develop a unified model to estimate landslide hazard at the slope unit
level to address such gaps. We employed deep learning, combined with a model
motivated by extreme-value theory to analyse an inventory of 30 years of
observed rainfall-triggered landslides in Nepal and assess landslide hazard for
multiple return periods. We also use our model to further explore landslide
hazard for the same return periods under different climate change scenarios up
to the end of the century. Our results show that the proposed model performs
excellently and can be used to model landslide hazard in a unified manner.
Geomorphologically, we find that under both climate change scenarios (SSP245

in the lower Himalayan regions while remaining the same in the middle Himalayan
region whilst decreasing slightly in the upper Himalayan region areas.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14210v1

such highly specific hardware. In this study, we perform a cradle-to-gate life
cycle assessment (LCA) of dedicated Bitcoin mining equipment, considering their
specific architecture. Our results show that the application-specific
integrated circuit designed for Bitcoin mining is the main contributor to
production-related impacts. This observation applies to most impact categories,
including the global warming potential. In addition, this finding stresses out
the necessity to carefully consider the specificity of the hardware. By
comparing these results with several usage scenarios, we also demonstrate that
the impacts of producing this type of equipment can be significant (up to 80%
of the total life cycle impacts), depending on the sources of electricity
supply for the use phase. Therefore, we highlight the need to consider the
production phase when assessing the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining

ecoinvent databases for the background modeling of our system. Surprisingly, it
leads to results with variations of up to 4 orders of magnitude for

  Earth's orbital eccentricity (g2-g5): Implications for astrochronology",2024-03-14T12:20:59Z,"Richard E. Zeebe, Margriet L. Lantink","The planets' gravitational interaction causes rhythmic changes in Earth's
orbital parameters (also called Milankovi\'c cycles), which have powerful
applications in geology and astrochronology. For instance, the primary
astronomical eccentricity cycle due to the secular frequency term (g2-g5) (~405
kyr in the recent past) utilized in deep-time analyses is dominated by Venus'
and Jupiter's orbits, aka long eccentricity cycle. The widely accepted and
long-held view is that (g2-g5) was practically stable in the past and may hence
be used as a ""metronome"" to reconstruct accurate ages and chronologies.
However, using state-of-the-art integrations of the solar system, we show here
that (g2-g5) can become unstable over long time scales, without major changes
in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. The (g2-g5) disruption is due to
the secular resonance $\sigma_{12}$ = (g1 - g2) + (s1 - s2), a major
contributor to solar system chaos. We demonstrate that entering/exiting the
$\sigma_{12}$ resonance is a common phenomenon on long time scales, occurring
in ~40% of our solutions. During $\sigma_{12}$-resonance episodes, (g2-g5) is
very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing
spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. Our results have
fundamental implications for geology and astrochronology, as well as climate
forcing because the paradigm that the longest Milankovi\'c cycle dominates
Earth's astronomical forcing, is stable, and has a period of ~405 kyr requires

hydrogen systems, can help mitigate climate change by ensuring a more stable
and sustainable power supply. To maximize the effectiveness of such energy
storage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each
time period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional
optimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to
dynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging
and discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete
reinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based
on state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement
learning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible
charge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for
learning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the
objectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value
learning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by
preventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous
full charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the

waves with return times of a few years like in previous studies, but we also
propose a new methodological approach, return time maps, that allows us to
study rare heat waves with return times from 10 to 50 years. We use the outputs
from three climate models, namely IPSL-CM6A-LR, EC-Earth3, and CNRM-CM6-1, in
which North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are restored towards the observed
AMV anomalies. The three models give consistent results, with the exception of
EC-Earth simulating a much greater influence of soil moisture. Typical AMV or
spring soil moisture anomalies induce changes in the temperature and duration
of heat waves that are of comparable amplitude, but follow different regional
patterns. As might be expected, a positive AMV phase or low soil moisture
induces hotter and longer typical heat waves over most of Europe. However,
counter-intuitively, they also induce less heat wave days and cooler heat waves
over part of Northeast Europe. For more extreme events, the influence of the
AMV and soil moisture increase, according to rather similar regional patterns

global biogeochemical cycles. Despite its importance, the complex architecture
of soil pores and their impact on greenhouse gas emissions remain poorly
understood. This perspective aims to address this gap by applying symmetry and
symmetry-breaking concepts through fractal geometry to elucidate the structural
and functional complexities of soil pores. We highlight how fractal parameters
can quantify the self-similar nature of soil pore structures, revealing their
size, shape, and connectivity. These geometric attributes influence soil
properties such as permeability and diffusivity, which are essential for
understanding gas exchange and microbial activity within the soil matrix.
Furthermore, we emphasize the effects of various land management practices,
including tillage and wetting-drying cycles, on soil pore complexity using
three-dimensional multi-fractal analysis. Literature indicates that different
agricultural practices significantly alter pore heterogeneity and connectivity,
affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional tillage decreases pore
connectivity and increases randomness, whereas no-tillage preserves larger,
more complex pore structures. We propose that integrating combinatorial,
geometric, and functional symmetry concepts offers a comprehensive framework
for examining the structure-property-function relationships in soil. This novel
approach could enhance our understanding of soil's role in the global cycle of

trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on
relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for
the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the

introduces a pipeline that integrates principles from both perturbation-based

The proposed pipeline simplifies the undertaking of diverse investigative

also acts as an air pollutant. Given its high radiative forcing potential and
relatively short atmospheric lifetime (9$\pm$1 years), methane has important
implications for climate change, therefore, cutting methane emissions is
crucial for effective climate change mitigation. This work expands existing
information on operational methane point source detection sensors in the
Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. It reviews the state-of-the-art for

Explainable artificial intelligence was used to analyze the model's predictions
during the October 2020 Central South America compound heatwave and drought

counterfactual, finding that the average temperature and surface pressure are
generally the best predictors under normal conditions. In contrast, minimum
anomalies of evaporation and surface latent heat flux take the lead during the
event. A change of regime is also observed in the attributions before the

housing, amplifying existing vulnerabilities within communities. Understanding
the interplay between climate change, wildfires, evacuation patterns, and
socioeconomic factors is crucial for developing effective mitigation and
adaptation strategies. To contribute to this challenge, we use high-definition
mobile phone records to analyse evacuation patterns during the wildfires in
Valpara\'iso, Chile, that took place between February 2-3, 2024. This data
allows us to track the movements of individuals in the disaster area, providing
insight into how people respond to large-scale evacuations in the context of
severe wildfires. We apply a causal inference approach that combines regression
discontinuity and difference-in-differences methodologies to observe evacuation
behaviours during wildfires, with a focus on socioeconomic stratification. This
approach allows us to isolate the impact of the wildfires on different
socioeconomic groups by comparing the evacuation patterns of affected
populations before and after the event, while accounting for underlying trends
and discontinuities at the threshold of the disaster. We find that many people
spent nights away from home, with those in the lowest socioeconomic segment
stayed away the longest. In general, people reduced their travel distance
during the evacuation, and the lowest socioeconomic group moved the least.
Initially, movements became more random, as people sought refuge in a rush, but

Hybrid Bayesian Smoothing on Surfaces,2024-10-28T19:14:55Z,"Matthew Hofkes, Douglas Nychka","Modeling spatial processes that exhibit both smooth and rough features poses
a significant challenge. This is especially true in fields where complex
physical variables are observed across spatial domains. Traditional spatial
techniques, such as Gaussian processes (GPs), are ill-suited to capture sharp
transitions and discontinuities in spatial fields. In this paper, we propose a
new approach incorporating non-Gaussian processes (NGPs) into a hybrid model
which identifies both smooth and rough components. Specifically, we model the
rough process using scaled mixtures of Gaussian distributions in a Bayesian
hierarchical model (BHM).
  Our motivation comes from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble
(CESM-LE), where we seek to emulate climate sensitivity fields that exhibit
complex spatial patterns, including abrupt transitions at ocean-land
boundaries. We demonstrate that traditional GP models fail to capture such
abrupt changes and that our proposed hybrid model, implemented through a full
Gibbs sampler. This significantly improves model interpretability and accurate
recovery of process parameters.
  Through a multi-factor simulation study, we evaluate the performance of
several scaled mixtures designed to model the rough process. The results
highlight the advantages of using these heavier tailed priors as a replacement
to the Bayesian fused LASSO. One prior in particular, the normal Jeffrey's
prior stands above the rest. We apply our model to the CESM-LE dataset,
demonstrating its ability to better represent the mean function and its
uncertainty in climate sensitivity fields.
  This work combines the strengths of GPs for smooth processes with the
flexibility of NGPs for abrupt changes. We provide a computationally efficient

At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to

in these changes, causing severe economic and environmental damage. This study
presents a novel predictive model that integrates systematically local and
global climatic signals to forecast Super El Ni\~no events, introducing the
Super El Ni\~no Index (SEI), which value of 80 or higher defines a Super El

Ni\~no events, including those from 1982-83, 1997-98, and 2015-16, with SEI
values for these periods containing 80 within the 2-sigma standard deviation.
Using data up to 2022, our model predicted an SEI of around 80 for 2023,
indicating a Super El Ni\~no for the 2023-24 period. Recent observations
confirm that the 2023-24 El Ni\~no is among the five strongest recorded Super
El Ni\~no events in history. An analysis of SEI trends from 1982 to 2023
reveals a gradual increase, with recent El Ni\~no events consistently exceeding
SEI values of 70. This trend suggests that El Ni\~no events are increasingly
approaching Super El Ni\~no intensity, potentially due to more favorable

ecological benefits is uncertain. Here, we quantified the long-term effects of
agricultural diversification practices on socioeconomic and ecological benefits

showed that, with neutral crop yield over time, financial profitability, most
variables related to biological communities, all aspects of soil quality, and
carbon sequestration benefits increased by up to 2823% over 20 years of
practice. Non-crop diversification practices and the use of organic amendments
increased benefits by up to 2000% after 50 years. A trade-off analysis between
yield and other services showed win-win outcomes during the first 25 years. Our

Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems,2024-05-01T08:42:22Z,"Fredrik Hagström, Vikas Garg, Fabricio Oliveira","Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption. A considerable
portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems
has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In
recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been
increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt
purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical
controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal
comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency,
requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them
inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. Hence, common research goals
are to improve the learning speed, as well as to improve their ability to
generalize, in order to facilitate transfer learning to unseen building
environments. In this paper, we take a federated learning approach to training
the reinforcement learning controller of an HVAC system. A global control
policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data
centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to
simultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. The
federated optimization strategy indirectly increases both the rate at which
experience data is collected and the variation in the data. We demonstrate
through experimental evaluation that these effects lead to a faster learning
speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy
compared to any individually trained policy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00389v1

  and Demographic Shifts in Austrian Districts",2024-05-01T14:27:15Z,"Hannah Schuster, Axel Polleres, Amin Anjomshoaa, Johannes Wachs","The impact of hot weather on health outcomes of a population is mediated by a
variety of factors, including its age profile and local green infrastructure.
The combination of warming due to climate change and demographic aging suggests
that heat-related health outcomes will deteriorate in the coming decades. Here,
we measure the relationship between weekly all-cause mortality and heat days in
Austrian districts using a panel dataset covering $2015-2022$. An additional
day reaching $30$ degrees is associated with a $2.4\%$ increase in mortality
per $1000$ inhabitants during summer. This association is roughly doubled in
districts with a two standard deviation above average share of the population
over $65$. Using forecasts of hot days (RCP) and demographics in $2050$, we
observe that districts will have elderly populations and hot days $2-5$
standard deviations above the current mean in just $25$ years. This predicts a
drastic increase in heat-related mortality. At the same time, district green
scores, measured using $10\times 10$ meter resolution satellite images of
residential areas, significantly moderate the relationship between heat and
mortality. Thus, although local policies likely cannot reverse warming or
demographic trends, they can take measures to mediate the health consequences
of these growing risks, which are highly heterogeneous across regions, even in

Discrete element method model of soot aggregates,2024-07-16T03:31:47Z,"Egor V. Demidov, Gennady Y. Gor, Alexei F. Khalizov","Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by
scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates
composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire
coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction
of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently,
no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring,
reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a
discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot
aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by
sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy
data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of
necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer
necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking
prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of
nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging
through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot
aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured
simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly
compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254v3

Modeling Snow on Sea Ice using Physics Guided Machine Learning,2024-09-12T14:45:07Z,"Ayush Prasad, Ioanna Merkouriadi, Aleksi Nummelin","Snow is a crucial element of the sea ice system, affecting sea ice growth and
decay due to its low thermal conductivity and high albedo. Despite its
importance, present-day climate models have an idealized representation of
snow, often including only single-layer thermodynamics and omitting several
processes that shape its properties. Although advanced snow process models like
SnowModel exist, they are often excluded from climate modeling due to their
high computational costs. SnowModel simulates snow depth, density, blowing-snow
redistribution, sublimation, grain size, and thermal conductivity in a
multi-layer snowpack. It operates with high spatial (1 meter) and temporal (1
hour) resolution. However, for large regions like the Arctic Ocean, these
high-resolution simulations face challenges such as slow processing and large
resource requirements. Data-driven emulators are used to address these issues,
but they often lack generalizability and consistency with physical laws. In our

incorporates physical laws governing changes in snow density due to compaction.
We evaluated three machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Physics-Guided LSTM, and Random Forest across five Arctic regions. All models
achieved high accuracy, with the Physics-Guided LSTM showing the best

"Interpolation-Free Deep Learning for Meteorological Downscaling on
  Unaligned Grids Across Multiple Domains with Application to Wind Power",2024-10-04T22:04:40Z,"Jean-Sébastien Giroux, Simon-Philippe Breton, Julie Carreau","As climate change intensifies, the shift to cleaner energy sources becomes
increasingly urgent. With wind energy production set to accelerate, reliable
wind probabilistic forecasts are essential to ensure its efficient use.
However, since numerical weather prediction models are computationally
expensive, probabilistic forecasts are produced at resolutions too coarse to
capture all mesoscale wind behaviors. Statistical downscaling, typically
applied to enchance the resolution of climate model simulations, presents a
viable solution with lower computational costs by learning a mapping from
low-resolution (LR) variables to high-resolution (HR) meteorological variables.
Leveraging deep learning, we evaluate a downscaling model based on a
state-of-the-art U-Net architecture, applied to an ensemble member from a
coarse-scale probabilistic forecast of wind velocity. The architecture is
modified to incorporate (1) a learned grid alignment strategy to resolve LR-HR
grid mismatches and (2) a processing module for multi-level atmospheric
predictors. To extend the downscaling model's applicability from fixed spatial
domains to the entire Canadian region, we assess a transfer learning approach.
Our results show that the learned grid alignment strategy performs as well as
conventional pre-processing interpolation steps and that LR wind speed at
multiple levels is sufficient as a predictor, enabling a more compact
architecture. Additionally, they suggest that extending to new spatial domains
using transfer learning is promising, and that downscaled wind velocities
demonstrate potential in improving the detection of wind power ramps, a
critical phenomenon for wind energy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03945v1

  Revisited",2024-10-14T07:12:06Z,Axel Kleidon,"Life is a planetary feature that depends on its environment, but it has also
strongly shaped the physical conditions on Earth, having created conditions
highly suitable for a productive biosphere. Clearly, the second law of
thermodynamics must apply to these dynamics as well, but how? What insights can
we gain by placing life and its effects on planetary functioning in the context
of the second law? In Kleidon (2010), I described a thermodynamic Earth system
perspective by placing the functioning of the Earth system in terms of the
second law. The Earth system is represented by a planetary hierarchy of energy
transformations that are driven predominantly by incoming solar radiation,
these transformations are constrained by the second law, but they are also
modified by the feedbacks from various dissipative activities. It was then
hypothesised that life evolves its dissipative activity to the limits imposed
by this hierarchy and evolves feedbacks aimed at pushing these limits to higher
levels of dissipative activity. Here I provide an update of this perspective. I
first review applications to climate and global climate change to demonstrate
its success in predicting magnitudes of physical processes, particularly
regarding temperatures, heat redistribution and hydrological cycling. I then
focus on the limits to dissipative activity of the biosphere. It would seem
that the limitations by thermodynamics act indirectly by imposing limitations

"Simulation and Data Assimilation in an Idealized Coupled
  Atmosphere-Ocean-Sea Ice Floe Model with Cloud Effects",2024-10-30T15:53:51Z,"Changhong Mou, Samuel N. Stechmann, Nan Chen","Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the
Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice
between the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands,
understanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change
impacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely
overlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled
atmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects,
tackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems.
Sea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates
floes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a
two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and
ice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated
precipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces
and ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized
coupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between
atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds
and precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It
also serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of
unobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties.
Numerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data
assimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful
inference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These
results imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data
assimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23138v1

Types (PFTs) to discretize vegetation functional diversity, but these coarse
categorizations often overlook fine-scale variations shaped by local climate,
soil, and forest age factors. The lack of governing equations for plant
adaptation demands a paradigm shift in how we integrate diverse Earth
observations to uncover ecological functional dependence on changing
environments. To address this challenge, we developed DifferLand, a
differentiable, hybrid physics and machine learning model that infers the
spatial distributions of ecological parameters and their relationships with
environmental factors constrained by satellite and in-situ observations. Our
model unifies top-down and bottom-up observational constraints with
process-based knowledge to generate a global analysis of ecological functions
and their adaptation to environmental gradients. We found PFTs account for less
than half of the explainable spatial parameter variations controlling carbon
fluxes and vegetation states. The remaining parameter variability is largely
driven by local climate and forest demography factors, and the learned
environment-parameter relationships lead to enhanced spatial generalization at
unseen locations. DifferLand identified growing season length, leaf economics,
and agricultural intensity as the three orthogonal spatial gradients underlying
parameter variations. Our novel framework can lead to new insights on global
carbon cycling by learning directly from data and expanding our understanding

analyzed using two drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI),

more moderate for the near future. However, the results also indicated key
differences between indices. Projected drought conditions by using the SPEI

sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link
between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST
patterns, known as the ""pattern effect"", is typically diagnosed by studying the
response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we
diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized
warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by
studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by
atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature.
Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled
interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a
novel ""sensitivity map"" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to
SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a
spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in
traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in
externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate
studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks.
The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the
traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way
influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective
by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This
alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the
coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further
impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585v4

Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in
temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the
Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it effects large biochemical networks
with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it
has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a
characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a

geopolitical instability, climate change, and black swan events such as the
unforeseen closure of the Suez Canal. The problem of predicting local price
change under modification of an underlying transport network or change in
supply characteristics unites elements of game theory, network theory and
transport. The Cournot Oligopoly models economic actors as rational players
attempting to maximise profit by optimising supply quantities with analytical
results now consolidated about equilibrium characteristics where transport
conditions are fixed. Similarly, where supply and demand are fixed, the routing
of goods in a transport network can be analytically solved through a traffic
assignment problem. Hence we can solve the coupled Cournot-congestion problem
by means of a 2-layer network. Where the layers are linked, inter-layer
feedback wherein players attempt to maximise their utility occurs. In this
respect we find players benefit from taking advantage of non-simultaneous
responses to the market rather than moving to a new equilibrium. We draw
conclusions about the nature of equilibria, finding that the concave utility
curve property results in unique and stable equilibrium for each uncoupled
layer, while linked layers have a non-unique stable equilibria for which
general solutions are stated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19079v1

Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in three temperature levels (15, 25

insecticides based on acephate, spinosad and thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin,

other hand, methoxyfenozide + spinetoram caused average mortalities of 88.75%

caused by chlorfenapyr at 15, 25 and 30 {\deg}C were 1.25, 71.25 and 71.25%. On
the other hand, surviving adults in lethal toxicity bioassay did not show
differences in egg parasitism (F0 generation) and emergence of F1 generation in
all temperature levels studied; however, the insecticide methoxyfenozide +
spinetoram showed the lowest level of parasitism and emergence of T. podisi. In
addition, our results demonstrated significant changes in the proportion of
emerged males and females as the temperature increased; however, we did not
find any differences when comparing the insecticides studied. Furthermore, we
detected a significant interaction between insecticides and temperatures by
contaminating the host's parasitized eggs (parasitoid pupal stage). Generally,
the highest emergence reduction values were found at the highest temperature

"The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring
  changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs",2024-03-27T01:55:57Z,"Sage Anastasi, Giulio Dalla Riva","In this paper we present new methods that extend Baldassari and Gelman's
theory of polarisation. They show that it is useful to define polarisation as
increasing correlation between positions in an ideological field, which reduces
political pluralism. We also draw from post-structuralist work which argues
that deliberate development of these correlations is a feature of polarised
regimes such as apartheid.
  To measure polarisation in social networks, we use Random Dot Product Graphs
to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of a
social network provides an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the
number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. Each uncorrelated dimension
in a social network represents a part of that society which allows two people
from different groups to form a social connection, such as living in a racially
integrated neighbourhood. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the
embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are
becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We apply this method to the communication interactions among New Zealand
Twitter users discussing climate change issues from 2017 to 2023. We find that
the discussion is more polarised after 2020 than before, as shown by a decrease
in the dimensionality of the communication network. Second, we apply this
method to discussions of the COP climate change conferences, showing that our
methods agree with other researchers' detections of polarisation in this space.
Finally, we use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an
increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the
predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease
the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation
processes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191v2

  interacting bistable elements",2024-01-19T04:29:43Z,"Hidemasa Ishii, Hiroshi Kori","Diverse complex systems often undergo sudden changes in their states, such as
epileptic seizures, climate changes, and social uprisings. Such behavior has
been modeled by noise-induced escape of bistable elements, which is the escape
from an attracting state driven by a fluctuation in the system's state. We
consider a system of interacting bistable elements and investigate the effect
of diffusive coupling among elements on the process of noise-induced escape. We
focus on the influence of the coupling strength over the escape time, which is
the time it takes for noise-induced escape to occur. We performed numerical
simulations and observed that weak coupling reduced the mean escape time,
whereas strong coupling impeded escape. We argue that, although diffusive
coupling both facilitates and impedes escape, the facilitating effect is
dominant when coupling is weak. For weak coupling cases, we develop an
approximate theory that can predict the mean and variance of escape times. In
contrast, strong coupling reduces the effective noise intensity to impede
escape. Our results suggest that diffusive coupling among multistable elements
contributes to regulating the rate of transitions among attracting states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10489v1

population growth after successive warming events, with generalist species
demonstrating greater growth across all regions analyzed. The comparatively

rise and climate change. A key metric for evaluating transportation system
degradation is accessibility, yet the lack of temporally and spatially
disaggregate data means that the impact of recurrent flooding on accessibility,

crowdsourced WAZE flood incident data from the Hampton Roads region in
Virginia, this study (Part 1) examines changes in the roadway network
accessibility for travelers residing in 1,113 traffic analysis zones (TAZs)
across five time of day periods. Additionally, a social vulnerability index
framework is developed to understand the socioeconomic characteristics of TAZs
that experience high accessibility reduction under recurrent flooding.
  Results show that TAZs experience the most accessibility reduction under
recurrent flooding during the morning peak period (6 to 9am) with large
differences across different zones, ranging from 0 to 49.6 (percentage) for
work trips (with population weighted mean reduction of 1.71 percent) and 0 to
87.9 (percentage) for nonwork trips (with population weighted mean reduction of
0.81 percent). Furthermore, the social vulnerability analysis showed that zones
with higher percentages of lower socioeconomic status, unemployed, less
educated, and limited English proficiency residents experience greater
accessibility reduction for work trips. In contrast to previous studies that
aggregate the effects of recurrent flooding across a city, these results
demonstrate that there exists large spatial and temporal variation in recurrent

patterns is essential. Recent evidence suggests that more than half of the
reefs surveyed across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) exhibit deviations from
standard recovery modelling assumptions when the initial coral cover is low
($\leq 10$\%). New modelling is necessary to account for these observed
patterns to better inform management strategies. We consider a new model for
reef recovery at the coral cover scale that accounts for biphasic recovery

for uncertainty quantification of key parameters for assessing reef health and

for the future period were analyzed at annual and seasonal scales using several
evaluation metrics, such as the delta changes of the atmospheric and land
variables, the runoff and evapotranspiration ratios of the overall water
balance, the snowmelt contribution to the total streamflow and the centroid
position for the daily hydrograph of the average hydrologic year. Annual
streamflow reductions of up to 40% were attained in various parts of the basin
for 2071-2100 under RCP8.5 scenario, and resulted from the precipitation
decreases in the southern subwatersheds and the combined effect of the
precipitation decreases and evapotranspiration increases in the north. The
runoff and the evapotranspiration ratios evinced a tendency towards an
evaporative regime in the north part of the basin and a strengthening of the
evaporative response in the south. Seasonal streamflow changes were mostly
negative and dependent on the season considered, with greater detriments in
spring and summer, and less intense ones in autumn and winter. The snowmelt
contribution to the total streamflow was strongly diminished with decreases
reaching -80% in autumn and spring, thus pointing to a change in the snow
regime for the Duero mountains. Finally, the annual and seasonal changes of the

which are prime targets for characterisation. We introduce a parametrised
cometary impact model that includes thermal ablation and pressure driven
breakup, which we couple with the 1D `radiative-convective' atmospheric model

wide range of impactor masses and compositions, including those based on

that even a small impactor (R = 2.5 km) can lead to significant short-term
changes in the atmospheric chemistry, including a factor $>10$ enhancement in
H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ abundances, and atmospheric opacity more generally, and the

VegeDiff: Latent Diffusion Model for Geospatial Vegetation Forecasting,2024-07-17T14:15:52Z,"Sijie Zhao, Hao Chen, Xueliang Zhang, Pengfeng Xiao, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang","In the context of global climate change and frequent extreme weather events,
forecasting future geospatial vegetation states under these conditions is of
significant importance. The vegetation change process is influenced by the
complex interplay between dynamic meteorological variables and static
environmental variables, leading to high levels of uncertainty. Existing
deterministic methods are inadequate in addressing this uncertainty and fail to
accurately model the impact of these variables on vegetation, resulting in
blurry and inaccurate forecasting results. To address these issues, we propose
VegeDiff for the geospatial vegetation forecasting task. To our best knowledge,
VegeDiff is the first to employ a diffusion model to probabilistically capture
the uncertainties in vegetation change processes, enabling the generation of

the global impact of dynamic meteorological variables and the local effects of
static environmental variables, thus accurately modeling the impact of these

demonstrate the effectiveness of VegeDiff. By capturing the uncertainties in
vegetation changes and modeling the complex influence of relevant variables,
VegeDiff outperforms existing deterministic methods, providing clear and

Social bots sour activist sentiment without eroding engagement,2024-03-19T16:58:45Z,"Linda Li, Orsolya Vasarhelyi, Balazs Vedres","Social media platforms have witnessed a substantial increase in social bot
activity, significantly affecting online discourse. Our study explores the
dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change
protests from 18 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. We find that bots exert a
greater influence on human behavior than vice versa during heated online
periods. To assess the causal impact of human-bot communication, we compared
communication histories between human users who directly interacted with bots
and matched human users who did not. Our findings demonstrate a consistent
negative impact of bot interactions on subsequent human sentiment, with exposed
users displaying significantly more negative sentiment than their counterparts.
Furthermore, the nature of bot interaction influences human tweeting activity
and the sentiment towards protests. Political astroturfing bots increase
activity, whereas other bots decrease it. Sentiment changes towards protests
depend on the user's original support level, indicating targeted manipulation.
However, bot interactions do not change activists' engagement towards protests.
Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative
effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings
underscore the importance of unrestricted access to social media data for
studying the prevalence and influence of social bots, as with new technological
advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes nearly impossible.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12904v1
"Tropical cyclone genesis potential using a ventilated potential
  intensity",2024-04-02T02:07:13Z,"Daniel R Chavas, Suzana J Camargo, Michael K Tippett","Genesis potential indices (GPIs) are widely used to understand the
climatology of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, the sign of projected future
changes depends on how they incorporate environmental moisture. Recent theory
combines potential intensity and mid-tropospheric moisture into a single
quantity called the ventilated potential intensity, which removes this
ambiguity. This work proposes a new GPI ($GPI_v$) that is proportional to the
product of the ventilated potential intensity and the absolute vorticity raised
to a power. This power is estimated to be approximately 5 by fitting observed
tropical cyclone best-track and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data. Fitting the
model with separate exponents yields nearly identical values, indicating that
their product likely constitutes a single joint parameter. Likewise, results
are nearly identical for a Poisson model as for the power law. $GPI_v$ performs
comparably well to existing indices in reproducing the climatological
distribution of tropical cyclone genesis and its covariability with El
Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, while only requiring a single fitting exponent.
When applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
projections, $GPI_v$ predicts that environments globally will become gradually
more favorable for TC genesis with warming, consistent with prior work based on
the normalized entropy deficit, though significant changes emerge only at
higher latitudes under relatively strong warming. $GPI_v$ helps resolve the
debate over the treatment of the moisture term and its implication for changes
in TC genesis favorability with warming, and its clearer physical
interpretation may offer a step forward towards a theory for genesis across
climate states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01572v1

Deep Learning for predicting rate-induced tipping,2024-09-11T19:40:57Z,"Yu Huang, Sebastian Bathiany, Peter Ashwin, Niklas Boers","Nonlinear dynamical systems exposed to changing forcing can exhibit
catastrophic transitions between alternative and often markedly different
states. The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) can be used to anticipate
such transitions if caused by a bifurcation and if the change in forcing is
slow compared to the internal time scale of the system. However, in many
real-world situations, these assumptions are not met and transitions can be
triggered because the forcing exceeds a critical rate. For example, given the
pace of anthropogenic climate change in comparison to the internal time scales
of key Earth system components, such as the polar ice sheets or the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation, such rate-induced tipping poses a severe
risk. Moreover, depending on the realisation of random perturbations, some
trajectories may transition across an unstable boundary, while others do not,
even under the same forcing. CSD-based indicators generally cannot distinguish
these cases of noise-induced tipping versus no tipping. This severely limits
our ability to assess the risks of tipping, and to predict individual
trajectories. To address this, we make a first attempt to develop a deep
learning framework to predict transition probabilities of dynamical systems
ahead of rate-induced transitions. Our method issues early warnings, as
demonstrated on three prototypical systems for rate-induced tipping, subjected
to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise perturbations. Exploiting
explainable artificial intelligence methods, our framework captures the
fingerprints necessary for early detection of rate-induced tipping, even in
cases of long lead times. Our findings demonstrate the predictability of
rate-induced and noise-induced tipping, advancing our ability to determine safe
operating spaces for a broader class of dynamical systems than possible so far.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07590v1
Super Resolution On Global Weather Forecasts,2024-09-17T19:07:13Z,"Lawrence Zhang, Adam Yang, Rodz Andrie Amor, Bryan Zhang, Dhruv Rao","Weather forecasting is a vitally important tool for tasks ranging from
planning day to day activities to disaster response planning. However, modeling
weather has proven to be challenging task due to its chaotic and unpredictable
nature. Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence
the path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly
lose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical
forecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic
techniques to predict the change in weather variables over time. However, such
forecasts often require a very large amount of data and are extremely
computationally expensive. Furthermore, as climate and global weather patterns
change, classical models are substantially more difficult and time-consuming to
update for changing environments. Fortunately, with recent advances in deep
learning and publicly available high quality weather datasets, deploying
learning methods for estimating these complex systems has become feasible. The
current state-of-the-art deep learning models have comparable accuracy to the
industry standard numerical models and are becoming more ubiquitous in practice
due to their adaptability. Our group seeks to improve upon existing deep
learning based forecasting methods by increasing spatial resolutions of global
weather predictions. Specifically, we are interested in performing super
resolution (SR) on GraphCast temperature predictions by increasing the global
precision from 1 degree of accuracy to 0.5 degrees, which is approximately

the co-evolution of land, water, and energy sectors under different future

particular outcomes. The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth

Unified Momentum Model for Rotor Aerodynamics Across Operating Regimes,2024-01-17T22:27:24Z,"Jaime Liew, Kirby S. Heck, Michael F. Howland","Despite substantial growth in wind energy technology in recent decades,
aerodynamic modeling of wind turbines relies on momentum models derived in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, which are well-known to break down under
flow regimes in which wind turbines often operate. This gap in theoretical
modeling for rotors that are misaligned with the inflow and also for
high-thrust rotors has resulted in the development of numerous empirical
corrections which are widely applied in textbooks, research articles, and
open-source and industry design codes. This work reports a unified momentum
model to efficiently predict power production, thrust force, and wake dynamics
of rotors under arbitrary inflow angles and thrust coefficients without
empirical corrections. This unified momentum model can form a new basis for

from energy sector in Romania during the period 2008-2022 emissions using the
log mean Divisia index (LMDI) method and takes into account five items: CO$_2$
emissions, primary energy resources, energy consumption, gross domestic product
and population, the driving forces of CO$_2$ emissions, based on which it was
calculated the contribution of carbon intensity, energy mixes, generating
efficiency, economy, and population. The results indicate that generating
efficiency effect -90968.57 is the largest inhibiting index while economic
effect is the largest positive index 69084.04 having the role of increasing
CO$_2$ emissions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04354v1
Reasons behind the Water Crisis and its Potential Health Outcomes,2024-03-09T19:06:39Z,"Md. Galib Ishraq Emran, Rhidi Barma, Akram Hussain Khan, Mrinmoy Roy","Globally, the water crisis has become a significant problem that affects
developing and industrialized nations. Water shortage can harm public health by
increasing the chance of contracting water-borne diseases, dehydration, and
malnutrition. This study aims to examine the causes of the water problem and
its likely effects on human health. The study scrutinizes the reasons behind
the water crisis, including population increase, climate change, and
inefficient water management techniques. The results of a lack of water on
human health, such as the spread of infectious diseases, a higher risk of
starvation and dehydration, and psychological stress, are also concealed in the
study. The research further suggests several ways to deal with the water
situation and lessen its potential outcomes on human health. These remedies
include enhanced sanitation and hygiene procedures, water management, and
conservation techniques like rainwater gathering and wastewater recycling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07019v1
"Joint Planning of Charging Stations and Power Systems for Heavy-Duty
  Drayage Trucks",2024-03-21T22:21:46Z,"Zuzhao Ye, Nanpeng Yu, Ran Wei","As global concerns about climate change intensify, the transition towards
zero-emission freight is becoming increasingly vital. Drayage is an important
segment of the freight system, typically involving the transport of goods from
seaports or intermodal terminals to nearby warehouses. This sector
significantly contributes to not only greenhouse gas emissions, but also
pollution in densely populated areas. This study presents a holistic
optimization model designed for an efficient transition to zero-emission
drayage, offering cost-effective strategies for the coordinated investment
planning for power systems, charging infrastructure, and electric drayage
trucks. The model is validated in the Greater Los Angeles area, where
regulatory goals are among the most ambitious. Furthermore, the model's design
allows for easy adaptation to other regions. By focusing on drayage trucks,
this study also paves the way for future research into other freight
categories, establishing a foundation for a more extensive exploration in this
field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14866v1
"STEntConv: Predicting Disagreement with Stance Detection and a Signed
  Graph Convolutional Network",2024-03-23T16:45:22Z,"Isabelle Lorge, Li Zhang, Xiaowen Dong, Janet B. Pierrehumbert","The rise of social media platforms has led to an increase in polarised online
discussions, especially on political and socio-cultural topics such as
elections and climate change. We propose a simple and novel unsupervised method
to predict whether the authors of two posts agree or disagree, leveraging user
stances about named entities obtained from their posts. We present STEntConv, a
model which builds a graph of users and named entities weighted by stance and
trains a Signed Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN) to detect disagreement
between comment and reply posts. We run experiments and ablation studies and
show that including this information improves disagreement detection
performance on a dataset of Reddit posts for a range of controversial subreddit
topics, without the need for platform-specific features or user history.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15885v2
