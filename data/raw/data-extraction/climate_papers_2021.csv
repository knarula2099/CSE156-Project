Climate Change Conspiracy Theories on Social Media,2021-07-07T15:56:44Z,"Aman Tyagi, Kathleen M. Carley","One of the critical emerging challenges in climate change communication is
the prevalence of conspiracy theories. This paper discusses some of the major
conspiracy theories related to climate change found in a large Twitter corpus.
We use a state-of-the-art stance detection method to find whether conspiracy
theories are more popular among Disbelievers or Believers of climate change. We
then analyze which conspiracy theory is more popular than the others and how
popularity changes with climate change belief. We find that Disbelievers of
climate change are overwhelmingly responsible for sharing messages with
conspiracy theory-related keywords, and not all conspiracy theories are equally
shared. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for climate change
communication.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03318v1

between the number of tweets about climate change and major climate events; the
common topics people discuss climate change; and the trend of sentiment. Our

A Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework: A Spatial Approach,2021-08-22T15:50:55Z,"Claudia CÃ¡ceres, Yan Li, Brian Hilton","Climate change is affecting every known society, especially for small farmers
in Low-Income Countries because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality
patterns, and known temperature ranges. To build climate change resilient
communities among rural farmers, the first step is to understand the impact of
climate change on the population. This paper proposes a Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment Framework (CCVAF) to assess climate change
vulnerabilities among rural farmers. The CCVAF framework uses information and
communication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among
rural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household
level indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application
named THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change
is affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the
THRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes
to not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment
but also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a
class of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09762v1
"What shapes climate change perceptions in Africa? A random forest
  approach",2021-05-17T14:03:14Z,"Juan B Gonzalez, Alfonso Sanchez","Climate change perceptions are fundamental for adaptation and environmental
policy support. Although Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to
climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived
in the continent. Using random forest methodology, we analyse Afrobarometer
data (N = 45,732), joint with climatic data, to explore what shapes climate
change perceptions in Africa. We include 5 different dimensions of climate
change perceptions: awareness, belief in its human cause, risk perception, need
to stop it and self-efficacy. Results indicate that perceived agriculture
conditions are crucial for perceiving climate change. Country-level factors and
long-term changes in local weather conditions are among the most important
predictors. Moreover, education level, access to information, poverty,
authoritarian values, and trust in institutions shape individual climate change
perceptions. Demographic effects -- including religion -- seem negligible.
These findings suggest policymakers and environmental communicators how to
frame climate change in Africa to raise awareness, gather public support and
induce adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07867v1
"A large-scale bibliometric analysis of global climate change research
  between 2001 and 2018",2021-07-17T10:28:28Z,"Hui-Zhen Fu, Ludo Waltman","Global climate change is attracting widespread scientific, political, and
public attention owing to the involvement of international initiatives such as
the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We
present a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000
climate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change
is studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of
scientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical
distribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis,
we identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences,
paleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate
policy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time
period, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the
climate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient
energy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production
between developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands,
and national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research
interests and concerns of researchers in different countries. Our study can be
used by researchers and policy makers to reflect on the directions in which
climate change research is developing and discuss priorities for future
research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08214v1
"NLP for Climate Policy: Creating a Knowledge Platform for Holistic and
  Effective Climate Action",2021-05-12T12:30:02Z,"Pradip Swarnakar, Ashutosh Modi","Climate change is a burning issue of our time, with the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the United Nations demanding global climate
action. Realizing the urgency, in 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed an
agreement committing to taking voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the scale, magnitude, and climate action processes vary globally,
especially between developed and developing countries. Therefore, from
parliament to social media, the debates and discussions on climate change
gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design and
implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to
pool the worldwide dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and
unstructured data sources.
  The paper thematically discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in
climate policy research and contribute to society's good at large. In
particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate
policy using automated content analysis. We investigate the opinions
(sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards climate policy in the second
methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs towards
pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate
Knowledge Graph.
  The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform
would help in the formulation of a holistic climate policy and effective
climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate the policy actors'
varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to
effective climate action because policymakers can make informed decisions by
looking at the diverse public opinion on a comprehensive platform.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05621v1

Graph-based Local Climate Classification in Iran,2021-10-18T11:50:37Z,"Neda Akrami, Koorush Ziarati, Soumyabrata Dev","In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method to classify the
regions with similar climate in a local area. We refer our proposed method as
Graph Partition Based Method (GPBM). Our proposed method attempts to overcome
the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art methods in the literature. It
has no limit on the number of variables that can be used and also preserves the
nature of climate data. To illustrate the capability of our proposed algorithm,
we benchmark its performance with other state-of-the-art climate classification
techniques. The climate data is collected from 24 synoptic stations in Fars
province in southern Iran. The data includes seven climate variables stored as
time series from 1951 to 2017. Our results exhibit that our proposed method
performs a more realistic climate classification with less computational time.
It can save more information during the climate classification process and is
therefore efficient in further data analysis. Furthermore, using our method, we
can introduce seasonal graphs to better investigate seasonal climate changes.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first graph-based
climate classification system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09209v1
"Climate Change Valuation Adjustment (CCVA) using parameterized climate
  change impacts",2021-02-21T21:42:36Z,"Chris Kenyon, Mourad Berrahoui","We introduce Climate Change Valuation Adjustment (CCVA) to capture climate
change impacts on CVA+FVA that are currently invisible assuming typical market
practice. To discuss such impacts on CVA+FVA from changes to instantaneous
hazard rates we introduce a flexible and expressive parameterization to capture
the path of this impact to climate change endpoints, and transient transition
effects. Finally we provide quantification of examples of typical interest
where there is risk of economic stress from sea level change up to 2101, and
from transformations of business models. We find that even with the slowest
possible uniform approach to a climate change impact in 2101 there can still be
significant CVA+FVA impacts on interest rate swaps of 20 years or more
maturity. Transformation effects on CVA+FVA are strongly dependent on timing
and duration of business model transformation. Using a parameterized approach
enables discussion with stakeholders of economic impacts on CVA+FVA, whatever
the details behind the climate impact.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10691v3

"Quantifying uncertainty about global and regional economic impacts of
  climate change",2021-02-25T18:04:43Z,"Jenny Bjordal, Trude Storelvmo, Anthony A. Smith Jr","The economic impacts of climate change are highly uncertain. Two of the most
important uncertainties are the sensitivity of the climate system and the
so-called damage functions, which relate climate change to economic damages and
benefits. Despite broad awareness of these uncertainties, it is unclear which
of them is most important, both on the global as well as the regional level.
Here we apply different damage functions to data from climate models with
vastly different climate sensitivities, and find that uncertainty in both
climate sensitivity and economic damage per degree of warming are of similar
importance for the global economic impact. Increasing the climate sensitivity
or the sensitivity of the damage function both increases the economic damages
globally. Yet, at the country-level the effect varies depending on the initial
temperature as well as how much the country warms. Our findings emphasise the
importance of including these uncertainties in estimates of future economic
impacts, as they both are vital for the resulting impacts and thus policy
implications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13051v1

we examine a CBR system (PBI-CBR) designed to aid sustainable dairy farming by

climate changes, PBI-CBRs historical cases become less useful in predicting
future grass growth. Hence, we extend PBI-CBR using data augmentation, to
specifically handle disruptive climate events, using a counterfactual method
(from XAI). Study 1 shows that historical, extreme climate-events (climate
outlier cases) tend to be used by PBI-CBR to predict grass growth during
climate disrupted periods. Study 2 shows that synthetic outliers, generated as
counterfactuals on a outlier-boundary, improve the predictive accuracy of
PBICBR, during the drought of 2018. This study also shows that an

"Analysis of the Evolution of Parametric Drivers of High-End Sea-Level
  Hazards",2021-06-11T01:50:16Z,"Alana Hough, Tony E. Wong","Climate models are critical tools for developing strategies to manage the
risks posed by sea-level rise to coastal communities. While these models are
necessary for understanding climate risks, there is a level of uncertainty
inherent in each parameter in the models. This model parametric uncertainty
leads to uncertainty in future climate risks. Consequently, there is a need to
understand how those parameter uncertainties impact our assessment of future
climate risks and the efficacy of strategies to manage them. Here, we use
random forests to examine the parametric drivers of future climate risk and how
the relative importances of those drivers change over time. We find that the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and a factor that scales the effect of aerosols
on radiative forcing are consistently the most important climate model
parametric uncertainties throughout the 2020 to 2150 interval for both low and
high radiative forcing scenarios. The near-term hazards of high-end sea-level
rise are driven primarily by thermal expansion, while the longer-term hazards
are associated with mass loss from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Our
results highlight the practical importance of considering time-evolving
parametric uncertainties when developing strategies to manage future climate
risks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12041v1

is described as a Poisson process driven by aggregate CO2 emissions. The
severity of disasters is described using a generalized Pareto distribution
driven by the trend in regional real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

"How are cities pledging net zero? A computational approach to analyzing
  subnational climate strategies",2021-12-14T21:33:39Z,"Siddharth Sachdeva, Angel Hsu, Ian French, Elwin Lim","Cities have become primary actors on climate change and are increasingly
setting goals aimed at net-zero emissions. The rapid proliferation of
subnational governments ""racing to zero"" emissions and articulating their own
climate mitigation plans warrants closer examination to understand how these
actors intend to meet these goals. The scattered, incomplete and heterogeneous
nature of city climate policy documents, however, has made their systemic
analysis challenging. We analyze 318 climate action documents from cities that
have pledged net-zero targets or joined a transnational climate initiative with
this goal using machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP)
techniques. We use these approaches to accomplish two primary goals: 1)
determine text patterns that predict ""ambitious"" net-zero targets, where we
define an ambitious target as one that encompasses a subnational government's
economy-wide emissions; and 2) perform a sectoral analysis to identify patterns
and trade-offs in climate action themes (i.e., land-use, industry, buildings,
etc.). We find that cities that have defined ambitious climate actions tend to
emphasize quantitative metrics and specific high-emitting sectors in their
plans, supported by mentions of governance and citizen participation. Cities
predominantly emphasize energy-related actions in their plans, particularly in
the buildings, transport and heating sectors, but often at the expense of other
sectors, including land-use and climate impacts. The method presented in this
paper provides a replicable, scalable approach to analyzing climate action
plans and a first step towards facilitating cross-city learning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11207v1

Demographic perspectives in research on global environmental change,2021-02-01T10:38:54Z,Raya Muttarak,"Human population is at the centre of research on global environmental change.
On the one hand, population dynamics influence the environment and the global

health and wellbeing of the population is already being affected by climate
change. The knowledge on population dynamics and population heterogeneity thus
is fundamental in improving our understanding of how population size,
composition and distribution influence global environmental change and how
these changes affect subgroups of population differentially by demographic
characteristics and spatial distribution. Existing theoretical concepts and
methodological tools in demography can be readily applied to the study of
population and global environmental change. In the past couple of decades,
demographic research has enriched climate change research both in the analysis
of the impact of population dynamics on the global climate system as well as
the impact of climate change on human population. What is missing in the
literature is the study that investigates how global environmental change
affect current and future demographic processes and consequently population
trends. If global environmental change does influence fertility, mortality and
migration, the three key demographic components underlying population change,
population estimates and forecast need to adjust from the climate feedback in

surface temperature, and 7.9% for a 6$^\circ$C rise. Such relatively trivial
estimates of economic damages -- when these economists otherwise assume that
human economic productivity will be an order of magnitude higher than today --
contrast strongly with predictions made by scientists of significantly reduced
human habitability from climate change. Nonetheless, the coupled economic and
climate models used to make such predictions have been influential in the
international climate change debate and policy prescriptions. Here we review
the empirical work done by economists and show that it severely underestimates
damages from climate change by committing several methodological errors,
including neglecting tipping points, and assuming that economic sectors not
exposed to the weather are insulated from climate change. Most fundamentally,
the influential Integrated Assessment Model DICE is shown to be incapable of
generating an economic collapse, regardless of the level of damages. Given
these flaws, economists' empirical estimates of economic damages from global
warming should be rejected as unscientific, and models that have been
calibrated to them, such as DICE, should not be used to evaluate economic risks

Reconciling high resolution climate datasets using KrigR,2021-08-09T11:42:40Z,"Richard Davy, Erik Kusch","There is an increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution climate
data for the wide community of researchers interested in climate change and its
consequences. Currently, there is a large mismatch between the spatial
resolutions of global climate model and reanalysis datasets (at best around
0.25o and 0.1o respectively) and the resolutions needed by many end-users of
these datasets, which are typically on the scale of 30 arcseconds (~900m). This
need for improved spatial resolution in climate datasets has motivated several
groups to statistically downscale various combinations of observational or
reanalysis datasets. However, the variety of downscaling methods and inputs
used makes it difficult to reconcile the resultant differences between these
high-resolution datasets. Here we make use of the KrigR R-package to
statistically downscale the world-leading ERA5(-Land) reanalysis data using
kriging. We show that kriging can accurately recover spatial heterogeneity of
climate data given strong relationships with co-variates; that by preserving
the uncertainty associated with the statistical downscaling, one can
investigate and account for confidence in high-resolution climate data; and
that the statistical uncertainty provided by KrigR can explain much of the
difference between widely used high resolution climate datasets (CHELSA,
TerraClimate, and WorldClim2) depending on variable, timescale, and region.
This demonstrates the advantages of using KrigR to generate customized high

Uncertainty in Climate Science: Not Cause for Inaction,2021-08-19T16:45:43Z,"Juan M. Restrepo, Michael E. Mann","Using observational data and an elementary rigorous statistical fact it is
easily shown that the distribution of Earth's climate is non-stationary.
Examination of records of hundreds of local Industrial Era temperature
histories in the Northern Hemisphere were used to show this fact.
Statistically, the mean of the ensemble has been rising during the Industrial
Era. All of this confirms what climate scientists already know. The issue of
predictions under uncertainties was tackled as well: a simple balance model was
tuned to track an ensemble of climate records. Stochastic parametrizations were
created to capture natural and anthropogenic CO2 forcings. The resulting
stochastic model was then tested against historical data and then used to make
future predictions. This exercise confirmed as well climate science attribution
to significant global warming during the Industrial Era to anthropogenic
activities. The variability of the model due to uncertainties is simply not
large enough to obfuscate a clear rise in the mean temperature in the
Industrial Era. Further, even if the variance of the natural CO2 contribution
is greatly increased artificially (in the model), the fluctuations cannot
account for the current change in the historical mean.
  These outcomes weaken the factual validity of the US administration,
2016-2020, claims that there are too many uncertainties in climate and climate
science to make climate predictions, and further that contemporary reports of
floods, extreme weather, even a rising global mean temperature are simply

The climate in climate economics,2021-07-13T15:23:13Z,"Doris Folini, Felix KÃ¼bler, Aleksandra Malova, Simon Scheidegger","To analyze climate change mitigation strategies, economists rely on
simplified climate models - climate emulators. We propose a generic and
transparent calibration and evaluation strategy for these climate emulators
that is based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5). We
demonstrate that the appropriate choice of the free model parameters can be of
key relevance for the predicted social cost of carbon. We propose to use four
different test cases: two tests to separately calibrate and evaluate the carbon
cycle and temperature response, a test to quantify the transient climate
response, and a final test to evaluate the performance for scenarios close to
those arising from economic models. We re-calibrate the climate part of the
widely used DICE-2016: the multi-model mean as well as extreme, but still
permissible climate sensitivities and carbon cycle responses. We demonstrate
that the functional form of the climate emulator of the DICE-2016 model is fit
for purpose, despite its simplicity, but its carbon cycle and temperature
equations are miscalibrated. We examine the importance of the calibration for
the social cost of carbon in the context of a partial equilibrium setting where
interest rates are exogenous, as well as the simple general equilibrium setting
from DICE-2016. We find that the model uncertainty from different consistent
calibrations of the climate system can change the social cost of carbon by a
factor of four if one assumes a quadratic damage function. When calibrated to
the multi-model mean, our model predicts similar values for the social cost of
carbon as the original DICE-2016, but with a strongly reduced sensitivity to
the discount rate and about one degree less long-term warming. The social cost
of carbon in DICE-2016 is oversensitive to the discount rate, leading to
extreme comparative statics responses to changes in preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06162v3

challenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change and the
evolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems
are studied successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation
Theory (LDT). A great potential exists for applying LDT to problems relevant
for geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. In particular, LDT allows
for understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations of
climatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to
low-frequency, large scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT
can be used in conjunction with so-called rare events algorithms to explore
rarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special dynamical
configurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to
improve our understanding of high-impact weather and climate events.
Furthermore, LDT provides powerful tools for evaluating the probability of
noise-induced transitions between competing metastable states of the climate
system or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our
understanding of the global stability properties of the climate system and of
its predictability of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this

Episodic deluges in simulated hothouse climates,2021-11-04T19:11:07Z,"Jacob Seeley, Robin Wordsworth","Earth's distant past and potentially its future include extremely warm
""hothouse"" climate states, but little is known about how the atmosphere behaves
in such states. One distinguishing characteristic of hothouse climates is that
they feature lower-tropospheric radiative heating, rather than cooling, due to
the closing of the water vapor infrared window regions. Previous work has
suggested that this could lead to temperature inversions and significant
changes in cloud cover, but no previous modeling of the hothouse regime has
resolved convective-scale turbulent air motions and cloud cover directly, thus
leaving many questions about hothouse radiative heating unanswered. Here, we
conduct simulations that explicitly resolve convection and find that
lower-tropospheric radiative heating in hothouse climates causes the hydrologic
cycle to shift from a quasi-steady regime to a ""relaxation oscillator"" regime,
in which precipitation occurs in short and intense outbursts separated by
multi-day dry spells. The transition to the oscillatory regime is accompanied
by strongly enhanced local precipitation fluxes, a significant increase in
cloud cover, and a transiently positive (unstable) climate feedback parameter.
Our results indicate that hothouse climates may feature a novel form of
""temporal"" convective self-organization, with implications for both cloud

take us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially
when attempting to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand
long and numerous simulations in order to accurately represent their changing

generated samples to be nearly as well matched to the test data as the
validation data is to test. We also find the generated samples to accurately
estimate the mean number of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day

on material processes, an entropy budget for the climate system is derived

entropy budget facilitates a heat-engine perspective of atmospheric
circulations that has been used to propose theories for convective updraft

automatically exploring the parameter space more broadly. In Bayesian learning,
it is natural to exploit the seasonal cycle, which has large amplitude,

of the temperature trends across Australia in recent decades. In addition to
heterogeneity in mean and median values, daily Australia temperature data
suffers from quasi-periodic heterogeneity in variance. However, this issue has
barely been overlooked in climate research. A contribution of this article is
that we propose a joint model of quantile regression and variability. By
accounting appropriately for the heterogeneity in these types of data, our
analysis reveals that daily maximum temperature is warming by 0.21 Celsius per
decade and daily minimum temperature by 0.13 Celsius per decade. However, our
modeling also shows nuanced patterns of climate change depends on location,
season, and the percentiles of the temperature series over Australia.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05791v1

responsible for the water level variations in Lake Toba, North Sumatra
Province, Indonesia. According to several studies carried out from 1993 to
2020, changes in the water level were associated with climate variability,
climate change, and human activities. Furthermore, these studies stated that
reduced rainfall during the rainy season due to the El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the continuous increase in the maximum and average
temperatures were some of the effects of climate change in the Lake Toba
catchment area. Additionally, human interventions such as industrial
activities, population growth, and damage to the surrounding environment of the
Lake Toba watershed had significant impacts in terms of decreasing the water
level. However, these studies were unable to determine the factor that had the
most significant effect, although studies on other lakes worldwide have shown
these factors are the main causes of fluctuations or decreases in water levels.
A simulation study of Lake Toba's water balance showed the possibility of
having a water surplus until the mid-twenty-first century. The input discharge
was predicted to be greater than the output; therefore, Lake Toba could be
optimized without affecting the future water level. However, the climate
projections depicted a different situation, with scenarios predicting the
possibility of extreme climate anomalies, demonstrating drier climatic
conditions in the future. This review concludes that it is necessary to conduct
an in-depth, comprehensive, and systematic study to identify the most dominant
factor among the three that is causing the decrease in the Lake Toba water
level and to describe the future projected water level.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08918v1

significance and periodic ice jam flooding from both rivers is an important
feature of its current ecology. Past studies have debated whether a change in
ice jam flood (IJF) frequency on the Peace River has recently occurred, and
what factors might be driving any perceived changes. This study contributes to
this debate by addressing two questions: (1) what factors are most predictive
of Peace River IJFs, and (2) how might climate change impact IJF frequency?
This work starts with a physically-based conceptual model of the necessary
conditions for a large Peace River IJF, and the factors that indicate whether
those conditions are met. Logistic regression is applied to the historical
flood record to determine which combination of hydroclimatic and riverine
factors best predict IJFs and the uncertainty in those relationships given the
available data. Winter precipitation and temperature are most predictive of
Peace River IJFs, while freeze-up elevation contains little predictive power
and is not closely related to IJF occurrence. The best logistic regression
model is forced with downscaled climate change scenarios from multiple climate
models to project IJF frequency for a variety of plausible futures. Parametric
uncertainty in the best logistic regression model is propagated into the
projections using a parametric bootstrap to sample many plausible statistical
models. Although there is variability across emissions scenarios and climate
models, all projections indicate that the frequency of Peace River IJFs is
likely to decrease substantially in the coming decades, and that average
waiting times between future IJFs will likely surpass recent experience.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13282v1

"Modeling of Pan Evaporation Based on the Development of Machine Learning
  Methods",2021-10-10T10:06:16Z,Mustafa Al-Mukhtar,"For effective planning and management of water resources and implementation
of the related strategies, it is important to ensure proper estimation of
evaporation losses, especially in regions that are prone to drought. Changes in
climatic factors, such as changes in temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours,
humidity, and solar radiation can have a significant impact on the evaporation
process. As such, evaporation is a highly non-linear, non-stationary process,
and can be difficult to be modeled based on climatic factors, especially in
different agro-climatic conditions. The aim of this study, therefore, is to

Towards Representation Learning for Atmospheric Dynamics,2021-09-19T07:43:30Z,"Sebastian Hoffmann, Christian Lessig","The prediction of future climate scenarios under anthropogenic forcing is
critical to understand climate change and to assess the impact of potentially
counter-acting technologies. Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this
prediction rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but
often subtle influences. For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the
climate system, no well established metric exists and visual inspection is
currently still often used in practice. However, this ""eyeball metric"" cannot
be used for machine learning where an algorithmic description is required.
Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis
for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel,
self-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for
atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on
a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of
a randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components of the
wind field from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn
important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from
these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by
using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity
and divergence. Our upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its
statistics a high resolution reference closely and it significantly outperform
the state-of-the-art based on mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is
unsupervised, only requires a temporal sequence of fields, and uses a simple
auxiliary task, it has the potential to be of utility in a wide range of
applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09076v2

homogeneous sub-regions should improve the modelling of heavy precipitation by
inferring common regional distributional parameters. In addition, in the
detection and attribution (D&A) field, biases due to model errors in global

consistent subregions identified for all GCMs. This improves the spatial
clusters coherence and outperforms methods either based on margins or on

  drivers, and some cautious forecasts",2021-01-13T16:30:32Z,Frank Stefani,"The two main drivers of climate change on sub-Milankovic time scales are
re-assessed by means of a multiple regression analysis. Evaluating linear
combinations of the logarithm of carbon dioxide concentration and the
geomagnetic aa-index as a proxy for solar activity, we reproduce the sea
surface temperature (HadSST) since the middle of the 19th century with an
adjusted $R^2$ value of around 87 per cent for a climate sensitivity (of TCR
type) in the range of 0.6 K until 1.6 K per doubling of CO$_2$. The solution of
the regression is quite sensitive: when including data from the last decade,
the simultaneous occurrence of a strong El Ni\~no on one side and low aa-values
on the other side lead to a preponderance of solutions with relatively high
climate sensitivities around 1.6 K. If those later data are excluded, the
regression leads to a significantly higher weight of the aa-index and a
correspondingly lower climate sensitivity going down to 0.6 K. The plausibility
of such low values is discussed in view of recent experimental and
satellite-borne measurements. We argue that a further decade of data collection
will be needed to allow for a reliable distinction between low and high
sensitivity values. Based on recent ideas about a quasi-deterministic planetary
synchronization of the solar dynamo, we make a first attempt to predict the
aa-index and the resulting temperature anomaly for various typical CO$_2$
scenarios. Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear
CO$_2$ increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1
K until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent

adaptive capacity at local level and how it can be enhanced. We use path
analysis technique using the lavaan package in RStudio to empirically test the
role of information. We find that information is a direct and significant
contributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. However, even with
exponential growth in use of technology, particularly information and
communication technologies (ICTs), small farmers still lack access to
information which hinders their capacity to respond to weather and climate
risks. Thus, understanding the mechanism that can facilitate exchange and use
of information by the farming community more effectively is important. We take
an ensemble view of ICTs operationalized using ICT ecosystem and find
significant interlinkages between information, technology and the ICT ecosystem
that facilitate learning and information exchange and therefore contribute to
enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and building resilience to climate shocks.
We find that ICT ecosystem does facilitate access to information and also

  rotated Maximum Covariance Analysis",2021-05-10T18:58:08Z,"Niclas Rieger, Ãlvaro Corral, Estrella Olmedo, Antonio Turiel","A proper description of ocean-atmosphere interactions is key for a correct
understanding of climate evolution. The interplay among the different variables
acting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long
spatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions, those teleconnections
occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the
understanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by
standard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance
Analysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows to extract common dominant
patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the
non-physical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple
correlations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we
propose an extension, complex rotated MCA, to address both limitations. We
transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal
decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase
signals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints,
leading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an
example of application, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature
and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal
and spatial interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the
seasonal cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, (v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic

impact of rainfall and storm tide. However, existing approaches lack the
ability to model the combined effect of these flood mechanisms. Thus, to
increase flood resilience, modeling techniques to improve understanding and
prediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To
address this need, this study presents a modeling system for assessing the
combined flood risk to coastal cities under changing climate conditions that
leverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable of resolving urban
drainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated
in quantifying the future impact on transportation infrastructure within
Norfolk, Virginia USA. A series of combined storms events are modeled for
current (2020) and projected future (2070) climate conditions. Results show
that pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation
network compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070,
however, tidal flooding will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even
nuisance flooding expected to happen daily due to SLR. In 2070, nuisance
flooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is more
than two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled
model was compared with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method
to assess the difference resulting from the more complex modeling presented.
Results show that the bathtub method overestimated the flooded area near the
shoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070,

"Probing the timescale dependency of local and global variations in
  surface air temperature from climate simulations and reconstructions of the
  last millennia",2021-01-31T14:08:42Z,"Beatrice Ellerhoff, Kira Rehfeld","Earth's climate can be understood as a dynamical system that changes due to
external forcing and internal couplings. Essential climate variables, such as
surface air temperature, describe this dynamics. Our current interglacial, the
Holocene (11,700 yr ago to today), has been characterized by small variations
in global mean temperature prior to anthropogenic warming. However, the
mechanisms and spatiotemporal patterns of fluctuations around this mean, called
temperature variability, are poorly understood despite their socio-economic
relevance. Here, we examine discrepancies between temperature variability from
model simulations and paleoclimate reconstructions by categorizing the scaling
behavior of local and global surface air temperature on the timescale of years
to centuries. To this end, we contrast power spectral densities (PSD) and their
power-law scaling using simulated and observation-based temperature series of
the last 6000 yr. We further introduce the spectral gain to disentangle the
externally forced and internally generated variability as a function of
timescale. It is based on our estimate of the joint PSD of radiative forcing,
which exhibits a scale break around the period of 7 yr. We find that local
temperature series from paleoclimate reconstructions show a different scaling
behavior than simulated ones, with a tendency towards stronger persistence
(i.e., correlation between successive values within a time series) on periods
of 10 to 200 yr. Conversely, the PSD and spectral gain of global mean
temperature are consistent across data sets. Our results point to the
limitation of climate models to fully represent local temperature statistics
over decades to centuries. By highlighting the key characteristics of
temperature variability, we pave a way to better constrain possible changes in
temperature variability with global warming and assess future climate risks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00458v2

transmission cycle occurs in urban and rural areas. Climate conditions have
direct and indirect impacts on vector abundance and virus dynamics within the
mosquito. The significance of environmental variables as drivers in WNV
epidemiology is increasing under the current climate change scenario. In this
study, we used a machine learning algorithm to model WNV distributions in South
America. Our model evaluated eight environmental variables (type of biome,
annual temperature, seasonality of temperature, daytime temperature variation,
thermal amplitude, seasonality of precipitation, annual rainfall, and
elevation) for their contribution to the occurrence of WNV since its
introduction in South America (2004). Our results showed that environmental
variables can directly alter the occurrence of WNV, with lower precipitation
and higher temperatures associated with increased virus incidence. High-risk
areas may be modified in the coming years, becoming more evident with high
greenhouse gas emission levels. Countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay will be
greatly affected, drastically changing their current WNV distribution. Several
Brazilian areas will also increase the likelihood of presenting WNV, mainly in
the Northeast and Midwest regions and the Pantanal biome. The Galapagos Islands
will also probably increase their geographic range suitable for WNV occurrence.

Arctic have been spatially and temporally sparse. We propose a measurement
framework that would instrument existing sea ice buoys with strain gauges. This

"Nonstationary seasonal model for daily mean temperature distribution
  bridging bulk and tails",2021-10-19T15:18:00Z,"Mitchell Krock, Julie Bessac, Michael L. Stein, Adam H. Monahan","In traditional extreme value analysis, the bulk of the data is ignored, and
only the tails of the distribution are used for inference. Extreme observations
are specified as values that exceed a threshold or as maximum values over
distinct blocks of time, and subsequent estimation procedures are motivated by
asymptotic theory for extremes of random processes. For environmental data,
nonstationary behavior in the bulk of the distribution, such as seasonality or
climate change, will also be observed in the tails. To accurately model such
nonstationarity, it seems natural to use the entire dataset rather than just
the most extreme values. It is also common to observe different types of
nonstationarity in each tail of a distribution. Most work on extremes only
focuses on one tail of a distribution, but for temperature, both tails are of
interest. This paper builds on a recently proposed parametric model for the
entire probability distribution that has flexible behavior in both tails. We
apply an extension of this model to historical records of daily mean
temperature at several locations across the United States with different
climates and local conditions. We highlight the ability of the method to
quantify changes in the bulk and tails across the year over the past decades

largest point sources of methane. We present a high-resolution 0.1deg x 0.1deg
bottom-up gridded emission inventory for methane emissions from coal mines in
India and Australia, which are among the top five coal-producing countries in
2018. The aim is to reduce the uncertainty in local coal mine methane emissions
and to improve the spatial localization to support monitoring and mitigation of
these emissions. For India, we improve the spatial allocation of the emissions
by identifying the exact location of surface and underground coal mines and we
use a tier-2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology to
estimate the emissions from each coal mine using country-specific emission
factors. For Australia, we estimate the emission for each coal mine by
distributing the state-level reported total emissions using proxies of coal
production and the coal basin-specific gas content profile of underground
mines. Comparison of our total coal mine methane emission from India with
existing global inventories showed our estimates are about a factor 3 lower,
but well within the range of the national Indian estimate reported to the
United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). For both
countries, the new spatial distribution of the emissions shows a large
difference from the global inventories. Our improved emissions dataset will be
useful for air quality or climate modeling and while assessing the satellite
methane observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10317v2

can provide information regarding climate variability and climate change.
Changes in diurnal temperature range can have implications for hydrology, human
health and ecology, among others. Yet, the statistical literature on modelling

distribution of diurnal temperature range using the five-parameter lambda (FPL)
distribution. Additionally, in order to model diurnal temperature range with
explanatory variables, we propose a distributional quantile regression model
that combines quantile regression with marginal modelling using the FPL
distribution. Inference is performed using the method of quantiles. The models
are fitted to 30 years of daily observations of diurnal temperature range from
112 weather stations in the southern part of Norway. The flexible FPL
distribution shows great promise as a model for diurnal temperature range, and
performs well against competing models. The distributional quantile regression

"Shallow geothermal energy potential for heating and cooling of buildings
  with regeneration under climate change scenarios",2021-12-02T12:55:56Z,"Alina Walch, Xiang Li, Jonathan Chambers, Nahid Mohajeri, Selin Yilmaz, Martin Patel, Jean-Louis Scartezzini","Shallow ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs) are a promising technology for
contributing to the decarbonisation of the energy sector. In heating-dominated
climates, the combined use of GSHPs for both heating and cooling increases
their technical potential, defined as the maximum energy that can be exchanged
with the ground, as the re-injection of excess heat from space cooling leads to
a seasonal regeneration of the ground. This paper proposes a new approach to
quantify the technical potential of GSHPs, accounting for effects of seasonal
regeneration, and to estimate the useful energy to supply building energy
demands at regional scale. The useful energy is obtained for direct heat
exchange and for district heating and cooling (DHC) under several scenarios for
climate change and market penetration levels of cooling systems. The case study
in western Switzerland suggests that seasonal regeneration allows for annual
maximum heat extraction densities above 300 kWh/m$^2$ at heat injection
densities above 330 kWh/m$^2$. Results also show that GSHPs may cover up to 55%
of heating demand while covering 57% of service-sector cooling demand for
individual GSHPs in 2050, which increases to around 85% with DHC. The

emissions of CO2 by 2050. However, the window of opportunity is closing fast.
Geoengineering as the intentional and large-scale manipulation of the
environment and in particular the climate is increasingly discussed as a
complement to ongoing mitigation efforts. As a particular geoengineering
approach, space-based geoengineering blocks or dissipates a fraction of
incoming sunlight via many occulting membranes, located close to the Sun-Earth
Lagrange 1 point. However, the mass of the proposed sunshades, around
$10^7$-$10^8$ tons, and their associated cost render them about $10^3$ times
more costly than terrestrial alternatives. In this article, we propose a novel
sunshade concept, which is between $10^2$ to $10^3$ times lighter than the
lightest existing sunshade concepts. This is achieved via a net zero-radiation
pressure design, based on the use of diffractive metamaterials, removing one of
the major constraints to reducing sunshade mass. The whole sunshade system has
a total mass of approximately $6.2 \times 10^5$ tons and its deployment
requires between $10^2$ to $10^3$ annual launches during a ten-year period. The
achieved cost reduction might render space-based geoengineering competitive to

large amounts of problematic air pollutants, including Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).
Despite the importance of limiting GHG emissions to mitigate climate change,
detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of GHG and
other air pollutants is difficult to obtain. Existing models for surface-level
air pollution rely on extensive land-use datasets which are often locally
restricted and temporally static. This work proposes a deep learning approach
for the prediction of ambient air pollution that only relies on remote sensing

satellite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric column density air pollution
measurements enables the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case
NO$_2$) to high spatial resolution (up to $\sim$10m) at arbitrary locations and
adds a temporal component to these estimates. The proposed model performs with
high accuracy when evaluated against air quality measurements from ground

standard assumption of planetary symmetry about the equator. The dynamics of
separate Northern and Southern Hemisphere ice caps are coupled to an equation
representing the annual global mean surface temperature. The system has a
discontinuous switching mechanism based on mass balance principles for the
Northern Hemisphere ice sheet. We show the associated Filippov system admits a
unique nonsmooth and attracting limit cycle that represents the cycling between
glacial and interglacial states. Due to the vastly different time scales

in a two-dimensional (2D) configuration to simulate the clouds and circulation
on tidally locked aqua-planets. We find that the substellar area is covered by
deep convective clouds, the nightside is dominated by low-level clouds, and
these two are linked by a global-scale Walker circulation. We further find that
a uniform surface warming causes the substellar cloud width to decrease, but a
reduction in day-night surface temperature contrast or an increase in longwave
radiative cooling rate causes the substellar cloud width to increase. These
relationships can be roughly interpreted based on simple thermodynamic
theories. Comparing the results between CRM and global 3D general circulation
model (GCM), we find that they show qualitatively consistent results, including
the Walker circulation, the substellar clouds, and the responses of the
substellar ascending area and strength to changes in surface temperature or in
its zonal contrast. But, large quantitative differences exist, such as the
magnitude of cloud water path, the cloud width, and their responses to external
forcings. These results increase our confidence in using GCMs for modeling
exoplanetary climates, although large quantitative uncertainties should always
exist. Future work is required to use 3D CRM(s) with realistic radiative
transfer and with the Coriolis force to examine the clouds and climate of
tidally locked planets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04143v2
"A multispecies pseudoadiabat for simulating condensable-rich exoplanet
  atmospheres",2021-08-29T20:02:52Z,"R. J. Graham, Tim Lichtenberg, Ryan Boukrouche, Ray Pierrehumbert","Central stages in the evolution of rocky, potentially habitable planets may
play out under atmospheric conditions with a large inventory of non-dilute
condensable components. Variations in condensate retention and accompanying
changes in local lapse rate may substantially affect planetary climate and
surface conditions, but there is currently no general theory to effectively
describe such atmospheres. In this article, expanding on the work by Li et al.
(2018), we generalize the single-component moist pseudoadiabat derivation in
Pierrehumbert (2010) to allow for multiple condensing components of arbitrary
diluteness and retained condensate fraction. The introduction of a freely
tunable retained condensate fraction allows for a flexible, self-consistent
treatment of atmospheres with non-dilute condensable components. To test the
pseudoadiabat's capabilities for simulating a diverse range of climates, we
apply the formula to planetary atmospheres with compositions, surface
pressures, and temperatures representing important stages with condensable-rich
atmospheres in the evolution of terrestrial planets: a magma ocean planet in a
runaway greenhouse state; a post-impact, late veneer-analogue planet with a
complex atmospheric composition; and an Archean Earth-like planet near the
outer edge of the classical circumstellar habitable zone. We find that
variations in the retention of multiple non-dilute condensable species can
significantly affect the lapse rate and in turn outgoing radiation and the
spectral signatures of planetary atmospheres. The presented formulation allows
for a more comprehensive treatment of the climate evolution of rocky exoplanets
and early Earth analogues.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12902v1
Towards fully ab initio simulation of atmospheric aerosol nucleation,2021-07-10T09:43:38Z,"Shuai Jiang, Yi-Rong Liu, Teng Huang, Ya-Juan Feng, Chun-Yu Wang, Zhong-Quan Wang, Wei Huang","Atmospheric aerosol nucleation contributes to more than half of cloud
condensation nuclei globally. The emissions, properties and concentrations of
atmospheric aerosols or aerosol precursors could respond significantly to
climate change. Despite the importance for climate, the detailed nucleation
mechanisms are still poorly understood. The ultimate goal of theoretical
understanding aerosol nucleation is to simulate nucleation in ambient
condition, hindered by lack of accurate reactive force field. Here we propose
the reactive force field for nucleation systems with good size scalability
based on deep neural network. The huge computational costs from direct
molecular dynamics in ambient conditions are surmounted by bridging the
simulation in the limited box with cluster kinetics, facilitating the aerosol
nucleation simulation to be fully ab initio. We found that the acid-base
formation rates previously based on hard sphere collision rate constants tend
to be underestimated up to several times. These findings show that the widely
recognized acid-base nucleation observed in the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor
Droplets) chamber experiments, pristine and polluted environments should be
revisited to considering the contribution of collision enhancement. Besides,
the framework here is transferable to other nucleation systems, potentially
boosting the nucleation parameterizations accuracy generally to effectively
advance the climate model predictions reliability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04802v2
Simulating cloud-aerosol interactions made by ship emissions,2021-11-09T19:02:32Z,"Lekha Patel, Lyndsay Shand","Satellite imagery can detect temporary cloud trails or ship tracks formed
from aerosols emitted from large ships traversing our oceans, a phenomenon that
global climate models cannot directly reproduce. Ship tracks are observable
examples of marine cloud brightening, a potential solar climate intervention
that shows promise in helping combat climate change. Whether or not a ship's
emission path visibly impacts the clouds above and how long a ship track
visibly persists largely depends on the exhaust type and properties of the
boundary layer with which it mixes. In order to be able to statistically infer
the longevity of ship-emitted aerosols and characterize atmospheric conditions
under which they form, a first step is to simulate, with mathematical surrogate
model rather than an expensive physical model, the path of these cloud-aerosol
interactions with parameters that are inferable from imagery. This will allow
us to compare when/where we would expect to ship tracks to be visible,
independent of atmospheric conditions, with what is actually observed from
satellite imagery to be able to infer under what atmospheric conditions do ship
tracks form. In this paper, we will discuss an approach to stochastically
simulate the behavior of ship induced aerosols parcels within naturally
generated clouds. Our method can use wind fields and potentially relevant
atmospheric variables to determine the approximate movement and behavior of the
cloud-aerosol tracks, and uses a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to
model the persistence behavior of cloud-aerosol paths. This SDE incorporates
both a drift and diffusion term which describes the movement of aerosol parcels
via wind and their diffusivity through the atmosphere, respectively. We
successfully demonstrate our proposed approach with an example using simulated
wind fields and ship paths.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05356v1

fits linear dynamical models to data. While the DMD usually approximates
non-linear terms in the true dynamics as a linear system with random noise, we

January 2021. To link plot scale transpiration with earth observations, we
utilized Sentinel-2 and local meteorological data. Within a machine learning

canopy transpiration. The R2 of the cross-validated trained models at the
measurement sites was between 0.57 and 0.80. These results demonstrate the
relevance of Sentinel-2 data for the data-driven upscaling of ecosystem fluxes

significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds 0.70 area

downscaled values, and mean decadal changes. 15 GCMs unanimously project an
increasing trend in the temperature for the study region. Also, uncertainty in
the projections for the summer months is greater than projection uncertainty
for other months. The mean absolute surface temperature increase for the three
periods is projected to be about 0.8{\deg}C, 2.4{\deg}C, and 3.8{\deg}C in the

Chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity, along 26{\deg} - 36{\deg}
S. We show that climate induced trends in primary productivity are highly
heterogeneous across the region. On the one hand, the well documented poleward
migration of the South Pacific Anticyclone (SPA) has led to decreased spring
upwelling winds in the region between ca. 30{\deg} and 34{\deg} S, and to their
intensification to the south. Decreased winds have produced slight increases in
sea surface temperature and a pronounced and meridionally extensive decrease in
surface Chlorophyll-a in this region of central Chile. To the north of 30{\deg}
S, significant increases in upwelling winds, decreased SST, and enhanced
Chlorophyll-a concentration are observed in the nearshore. We show that this
increased in upwelling driven coastal productivity is probably produced by the
increased land-sea pressure gradients (Bakun's effect) that have occurred over
the past two decades north of 30{\deg} S. Thus, climate drivers along the HUE
are inducing contrasting trends in oceanographic conditions and primary
productivity, which can have far-reaching consequences for coastal pelagic and
benthic ecosystems and lead to geographic displacements of the major fisheries.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11698v1

the agriculture sector is forced to move towards more efficient and sustainable
methods of farming to increase productivity. There is evidence that the use of

the linguistic signature of these conversations. Prior work has shown that
contentious content and structure can be a predictor for this task, however,

incorporating them to build interpretable models. We demonstrate that such

Environmental migration? An overview of the literature,2021-12-28T11:29:03Z,"Maria Cipollina, Luca De Benedictis, Elisa ScibÃ¨","The literature on the relationship between environmental factors such as
climatic changes and natural hazards and human mobility (both internal and

highlight the role of climate changes as a driver of migratory flows, while
others underline how this impact is mediated by geographical, economic and the
features of the environmental shock. This paper attempts to map this
literature, focusing on economics and empirical essays.
  The paper improves on the existing literature: (a) providing systematic
research of the literature through main bibliographic databases, followed by a
review and bibliometric analysis of all resulting papers; (b) building a
citation-based network of contributions, that hollows to identify four separate
clusters of paper; (c) applying meta-analysis methods on the sample of 96

working papers series or unpublished studies, providing 3,904 point estimates
of the effect of slow-onset events and 2,065 point estimates of the effect of

Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different

station-based data which is mostly limited upto the metropolitan cities. Also,
the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and
developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage
of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution

Natural Selection as the sum over all histories,2021-01-04T12:41:18Z,Clive Edward Neal Sturgess,"If evolution can be connected to the principle of least action, and if it is
depicted in evolution space versus time then it corresponds to the direction of
ultimate causation. As an organism evolves and follows a path of proximate
causation, if the vector is closely parallel to that of the ultimate causation
then the changes will confer desirable attributes which will lead to further
development. If however the variations do not occur in a direction close to the
of the ultimate causation vector the evolved organism will quickly die out.
This may be viewed as similar to Feynmans sum over all histories. Therefore,
the principle of least action gives a direction, but not a purpose, to
evolution. Taking the coevolution model of Lewontin, an equation of motion for
coevolution shows that it is the rate of evolutionary change that responds to
changes in the environment, in line with some evidence. In the face of widely
held views on mass extinctions because of climate change this gives some small
hope.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01563v1

  Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Problems with Slowly Changing Variables in
  A Continuous State Space",2021-06-10T04:58:31Z,"Vincent Zha, Ivey Chiu, Alexandre Guilbault, Jaime Tatis","Slowly changing variables in a continuous state space constitute an important
category of reinforcement learning and see its application in many domains,
such as modeling a climate control system where temperature, humidity, etc.
change slowly over time. However, this subject is less addressed in recent
studies. Classical methods with certain variants, such as Dynamic Programming
with Tile Coding which discretizes the state space, fail to handle slowly
changing variables because those methods cannot capture the tiny changes in
each transition step, as it is computationally expensive or impossible to
establish an extremely granular grid system. In this paper, we introduce a
Hyperspace Neighbor Penetration (HNP) approach that solves the problem. HNP
captures in each transition step the state's partial ""penetration"" into its
neighboring hyper-tiles in the gridded hyperspace, thus does not require the
transition to be inter-tile in order for the change to be captured. Therefore,
HNP allows for a very coarse grid system, which makes the computation feasible.
HNP assumes near linearity of the transition function in a local space, which
is commonly satisfied. In summary, HNP can be orders of magnitude more
efficient than classical method in handling slowly changing variables in
reinforcement learning. We have made an industrial implementation of NHP with a
great success.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05497v1
Selection and mutation in a shifting and fluctuating environment,2021-03-12T14:40:12Z,"Susely Figueroa Iglesias, Sepideh Mirrahimi","We study the evolutionary dynamics of a phenotypically structured population
in a changing environment , where the environmental conditions vary with a
linear trend but in an oscillatory manner. Such phenomena can be described by
parabolic Lotka-Volterra type equations with non-local competition and a time
dependent growth rate. We first study the long time behavior of the solution to
this problem. Next, using an approach based on Hamilton-Jacobi equations we
study asymptotically such long time solutions when the effects of the mutations
are small. We prove that, as the effect of the mutations vanishes, the
phenotypic density of the population concentrates on a single trait which
varies linearly with time, while the size of the population oscillates
periodically. In contrast with the case of an environment without linear shift,
such dominant trait does not have the maximal growth rate in the averaged
environment and there is a cost on the growth rate due to the climate shift. We
also provide an asymptotic expansion for the average size of the population and
for the critical speed above which the population goes extinct, which is
closely related to the derivation of an asymptotic expansion for the Floquet
eigenvalue in terms of the diffusion rate. By mean of a biological example,
this expansion allows to show that the fluctuations on the environment may help
the population to follow the climatic shift in a better way.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07317v2

Australia, and the West Pacific is noted for the frequent occurrence and
severity of its storms. These storms give rise to high-amplitude secondary
microseisms from sources, including the deep ocean regions, and primary
microseisms where the swells impinge on submarine topographic features. A
better understanding of the varying microseism wavefield enables improvements
to seismic imaging and development of proxy observables to complement sparse in
situ wave observations and hindcast models of the global ocean wave climate. We
analyze 12-26 years of seismic data from 11 seismic stations either on the East
Antarctic coast or sited in the Indian Ocean, Australia, and New Zealand. The
power spectral density of the seismic wavefield is calculated to explore how
the time-changing microseism intensity varies with (i) sea ice coverage
surrounding Antarctica and (ii) the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) climate index.
Variations in sea ice extent are found to be the dominant control on the
microseism intensity at Antarctic stations, which exhibit a seasonal pattern
phase-shifted by 4-5 months compared to stations in other continents. Peaks in
extremal intensity at East Antarctic stations occur in March-April, with the
highest peaks for secondary microseisms occurring during negative SAM events.
This relationship between microseism intensity and the SAM index is opposite to
that observed on the Antarctic Peninsula. This work informs the complexity of
microseism amplitudes in the Southern Hemisphere and assists ongoing
interdisciplinary investigations of interannual variability and long-term
trends.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08590v1

Italian peninsula, and especially the regions of southern Italy. For this
reason, the scientific community, and in particular that one of the remote
sensing, plays an important role in the development of reliable techniques to
provide useful support to the competent authorities. Therefore, in this work,
the capability of the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI), derived from
spaceborne remote sensing (RS) data, is assessed to monitor the forest fires
occurred on a specific study area during the summer of 2017: the volcano
Vesuvius, near Naples (in Campania, Italy). In particular, the index is
obtained from Sentinel-2 multispectral images of the European Space Agency
(ESA), which are free of charge and open accessible. Moreover, the twin
Sentinel-2 (S-2) sensors allows to overcome some restrictions on time delivery
and high frequency observation. These requirements are goodly matched by other
spaceborne sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS satellites, but at the expense of a
lower spatial resolution.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10352v1

year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and
built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas
flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that
reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production
across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also
decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March
2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of
comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate
anomalies in the cold season. We conclude that climate variations played a
larger role than COVID-19 induced stay-home orders in natural gas consumption

"Carbon Leakage in a European Power System with Inhomogeneous Carbon
  Prices",2021-05-12T14:00:30Z,"Markus Schlott, Omar El Sayed, Mariia Bilousova, Fabian Hofmann, Alexander Kies, Horst StÃ¶cker","Global warming is one of the main threats to the future of humanity and
extensive emissions of greenhouse gases are found to be the main cause of
global temperature rise as well as climate change. During the last decades
international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for
viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of
greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First,
to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now,
various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe
and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing.
However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies
significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices
in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals.
In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices
regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution
parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with
the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the
spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among
the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed
lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired
electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power
in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe - representing a potential risk for the
long term decarbonization targets within the European Union.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05669v1
Accelerating Weather Prediction using Near-Memory Reconfigurable Fabric,2021-07-19T09:41:19Z,"Gagandeep Singh, Dionysios Diamantopoulos, Juan GÃ³mez-Luna, Christoph Hagleitner, Sander Stuijk, Henk Corporaal, Onur Mutlu","Ongoing climate change calls for fast and accurate weather and climate
modeling. However, when solving large-scale weather prediction simulations,
state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations suffer from limited performance
and high energy consumption. These implementations are dominated by complex
irregular memory access patterns and low arithmetic intensity that pose
fundamental challenges to acceleration. To overcome these challenges, we
propose and evaluate the use of near-memory acceleration using a reconfigurable
fabric with high-bandwidth memory (HBM). We focus on compound stencils that are
fundamental kernels in weather prediction models. By using high-level synthesis
techniques, we develop NERO, an FPGA+HBM-based accelerator connected through
OCAPI (Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface) to an IBM POWER9 host
system. Our experimental results show that NERO outperforms a 16-core POWER9
system by 5.3x and 12.7x when running two different compound stencil kernels.
NERO reduces the energy consumption by 12x and 35x for the same two kernels
over the POWER9 system with an energy efficiency of 1.61 GFLOPS/Watt and 21.01

role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation.
Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done
via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements.
To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine
learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial
imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which
improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by
how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. This
proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon
estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and ground-truth field
measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation
project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite
imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by up to 10-times for tropical
reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and

have combined to revolutionize the study of ocean biogeochemical cycling, but
comparing the two data streams to each other and across time remains
challenging due to the strong spatial-temporal structuring of the ocean. Here,

these structured datasets for better marine ecosystem and climate predictions.
Wasserstein distance complements commonly used point-wise difference methods
such as the root mean squared error, by quantifying differences in terms of
spatial displacement in addition to magnitude. As a test case we consider
Chlorophyll (a key indicator of phytoplankton biomass) in the North-East
Pacific Ocean, obtained from model simulations, in situ measurements, and
satellite observations. We focus on two main applications: 1) Comparing model
predictions with satellite observations, and 2) temporal evolution of
Chlorophyll both seasonally and over longer time frames. Wasserstein distance
successfully isolates temporal and depth variability and quantifies shifts in
biogeochemical province boundaries. It also exposes relevant temporal trends in
satellite Chlorophyll consistent with climate change predictions. Our study
shows that optimal transport vectors underlying Wasserstein distance provide a
novel visualization tool for testing models and better understanding temporal

"Empathosphere: Promoting Constructive Communication in Ad-hoc Virtual
  Teams through Perspective-taking Spaces",2021-11-27T00:34:34Z,"Pranav Khadpe, Chinmay Kulkarni, Geoff Kaufman","When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or
deliberate, they often fail to engage with each others' perspectives in a
constructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst,
it can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working
together. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by
highlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter
interaction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because
they fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team
norms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless
team members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion
will be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded
intervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication
in teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the benefits
of ""experimental spaces"" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate
conducive to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses
the benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a
norm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere
achieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to
induce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to
an alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team
experience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction,
encouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted
teams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that
``experimental spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of
encouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving
communication in virtual teams.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13782v1

using traditional methods. Satellite gravity has proven successful at
documenting changes in total water mass at regional scales, and here we use
data from the Grace and Grace-FO missions, spanning 2002 - 2020, to track

Millennium drought (2002-2009) and 2010-11 heavy flooding events, which
contribute significant signal variability. However our extended datasets
demonstrate a negative trend in the geoid anomaly over the Murray-Darling Basin
of -1.5mm, equivalent to a water loss rate of -0.91 Gt yr-1. With the exception
of northern Australia, similar scale geoid declines are observed in most

how surface wetness affects the tropical hydrological cycle. When surface
wetness is decreased in an Earth-like general circulation model, the tropics
remain wet but transition from a rainy to rain-free regime. The rain-free
regime occurs when surface precipitation is suppressed as negative evaporation
(surface condensation) balances moisture flux convergence. The regime
transition is dominated by near-surface relative humidity changes in contrast
to the hypothesis that relative humidity changes are small. We show
near-surface relative humidity changes responsible for the regime transition
are controlled by re-evaporation of stratiform precipitation near the lifting

Consequential Life Cycle Assessment (CLCA) is a method to capture the
environmental consequences of the entire cause and effect chain of these
disruptions but has never been adapted to transportat disruption at the city
scale. This paper proposes a mathematical formalization of CLCA applied to a
territorial mobility change. The method is applied to quantify the impact on
climate change of the breakthrough of free-floating e-scooters (FFES) in Paris.
A FFES user survey is conducted to estimate the modal shifts due to FFES. Trip
substitutions from all the Parisian modes concerned are considered - personal
or shared bicycles and motor scooters, private car, taxi and ride-hailing, bus,
streetcar, metro and RER (the Paris metropolitan area mass rapid transit
system). All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA.
Final results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen
thousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to
major shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER,
22% from active modes). Recommendations are given to enhance their carbon
footprint. A scenario analysis shows that increasing the lifetime mileage is
insufficient to get a positive balance: reducing drastically servicing
emissions is also required. A sensitivity analysis switching the French
electricity mix for eleven other country mixes suggests a better climate change
effect of the FFES in similar metropolitan areas with higher electricity carbon
intensity, such as in Germany and China. Finally, the novelty and the limits of
the method are discussed, as well as the results and the role of e-scooters,
micromobility, and shared vehicles towards a sustainable mobility.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00680v1

carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this
study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional
theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped
beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy
of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has
extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could
be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped
beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine
beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,

global warming, the Arctic sea-ice cover is presently evolving at an

experienced large amplitude variations, from seasonal to orbital (Milankovitch)

the future electricity demand pattern is highly uncertain due to various

radiative response also means that atmospheric CO$_2$ changes of a given mass

"Sensitivity of airborne transmission of enveloped viruses to seasonal
  variation in indoor relative humidity",2021-06-28T21:10:51Z,"Alison Robey, Laura Fierce","In temperate climates, infection rates of enveloped viruses peak during the
winter. While these seasonal trends are established in influenza and human
coronaviruses, the mechanisms driving the variation remain poorly understood
and thus difficult to extend to similar viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In this study,
we use the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD)
to explore the sensitivity of airborne transmission to the seasonal variation
in indoor relative humidity across the wide range of relevant conditions, using
SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Relative humidity impacts the evaporation rate and
equilibrium size of airborne particles, which in turn may impact particle
removal rates and virion viability. Across a large ensemble of scenarios, we
found that the dry indoor conditions typical of the winter season lead to
slower inactivation than in the more humid summer season; in poorly ventilated
spaces, this reduction in inactivation rates increases the concentration of
active virions, but this effect was important when the susceptible person was
farther than 2 m downwind of the infectious person. On the other hand, changes
in particle settling velocity with relative humidity did not significantly
affect the removal or travel distance of virus-laden scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14985v1

Slow Migration of Brine Inclusions in First-Year Sea Ice,2021-09-08T13:37:35Z,"Noa Kraitzman, Keith Promislow, Brian Wetton","We derive a thermodynamically consistent model for phase change in sea ice by
adding salt to the framework introduced by Penrose and Fife. Taking the salt

by latent heat, and use multiscale analysis to derive a quasi-equilibrium
Stefan-type problem via a sharp interface scaling. The singular limit is
under-determined and the leading order system is closed by imposing local

determines interface motion as balance of curvature, temperature gradient, and
salt density. We resolve this numerically for axisymmetric surfaces and show
that the thermal gradients typical of arctic sea ice can have a decisive impact

Heterogeneous Ensemble for ESG Ratings Prediction,2021-09-21T10:42:24Z,"Tim Krappel, Alex Bogun, Damian Borth","Over the past years, topics ranging from climate change to human rights have
seen increasing importance for investment decisions. Hence, investors (asset
managers and asset owners) who wanted to incorporate these issues started to
assess companies based on how they handle such topics. For this assessment,
investors rely on specialized rating agencies that issue ratings along the
environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions. Such ratings allow them
to make investment decisions in favor of sustainability. However, rating
agencies base their analysis on subjective assessment of sustainability
reports, not provided by every company. Furthermore, due to human labor
involved, rating agencies are currently facing the challenge to scale up the

supporting sustainability, we propose a heterogeneous ensemble model to predict
ESG ratings using fundamental data. This model is based on feedforward neural

relations are identified from noise, and spurious ones are negligibly close to
zero. The solution, called causality distribution, measures the relative
strength causing the movement of all series or specific affected ones. If a

infrastructural domains such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing.
The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public
policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject
to changes and stresses due to solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology.
The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such
interactions increasingly dynamic causing potentially large swings, thus
presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human-natural system. This
paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the
significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent
domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across
diverse domains that may influence electric power grid risks, including
climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We
discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore
possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domains
interconnections. Our study provides an important first step towards
data-driven analysis and predictive modeling of risks in the coupled
interconnected systems. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk
assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data

"A revised lower estimate of ozone columns during Earth's oxygenated
  history",2021-02-23T13:05:16Z,"Gregory Cooke, Dan Marsh, Catherine Walsh, Benjamin Black, Jean-FranÃ§ois Lamarque","The history of molecular oxygen (O$_2$) in Earth's atmosphere is still
debated; however, geological evidence supports at least two major episodes
where O$_2$ increased by an order of magnitude or more: the Great Oxidation
Event (GOE) and the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event. O$_2$ concentrations have
likely fluctuated (between $10^{-3}$ and $1.5$ times the present atmospheric
level) since the GOE $\sim 2.4$ Gyr ago, resulting in a time-varying ozone
(O$_3$) layer. Using a three-dimensional chemistry-climate model, we simulate
changes in O$_3$ in Earth's atmosphere since the GOE and consider the
implications for surface habitability, and glaciation during the
Mesoproterozoic. We find lower O$_3$ columns (reduced by up to $4.68$ times for
a given O$_2$ level) compared to previous work; hence, higher fluxes of
biologically harmful UV radiation would have reached the surface. Reduced O$_3$
leads to enhanced tropospheric production of the hydroxyl radical (OH) which
then substantially reduces the lifetime of methane (CH$_4$). We show that a
CH$_4$ supported greenhouse effect during the Mesoproterozoic is highly
unlikely. The reduced O$_3$ columns we simulate have important implications for
astrobiological and terrestrial habitability, demonstrating the relevance of
three-dimensional chemistry-climate simulations when assessing paleoclimates

its atmospheric characterization in transit. Four GCMs have participated in
THAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM. This paper, focused on
the simulated observations, is the third part of a trilogy, following the
analysis of two land planet scenarios (part I) and two aquaplanet scenarios
(part II). Here, we show a robust agreement between the simulated spectra and
the number of transits estimated to detect the land planet atmospheres. For the
aquaplanet ones, using atmospheric data from any of the four GCMs would require
at least 17 transits. This prediction corresponds to UM simulated data which
produces the lowest and thinnest clouds. Between 35-40% more clouds are
predicted by ExoCAM or LMD-G due to higher thick terminator clouds. For the
first time this work provides ""GCM uncertainty error bars"" of 35-40% that need
to be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra. We also analyzed
the inter-transit variability induced by weather patterns and changes of
terminator cloudiness between transits. Its magnitude differs significantly

demand increasing, it is important to better understand which farm management
practices will maximize crop yields in various climatic conditions. To assess
the effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to
randomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects
but are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently,
researchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites
and other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding
variables or systematic measurement errors. Because experimental and
observational datasets have complementary strengths, in this paper we propose a
method that uses a combination of experimental and observational data in the
same analysis. As a case study, we focus on the causal effect of crop rotation
on corn (maize) and soy yields in the Midwestern United States. We find that,
in terms of root mean squared error, our hybrid method performs 13% better than
using experimental data alone and 26% better than using the observational data
alone in the task of predicting the effect of rotation on corn yield at
held-out experimental sites. Further, the causal estimates based on our method
suggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and
locations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soy
yield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures. In particular,
we estimated that the benefit of rotation on corn yields (and soy yields) was
0.84 t/ha (0.23 t/ha) on average for the top quintile of temperatures, 1.02

total solar irradiance (TSI) can affect our climate in the longer timescale. In
the evolutionary timescale, the TSI varies by a large amount and hence its
influence on the Earth's mean surface temperature (T$_{s}$) also increases
significantly. We develop a mass-loss dependent analytical model of TSI in the
evolutionary timescale and evaluated its influence on the T$_{s}$. We
determined the numerical solution of TSI for the next 8.23 Gyrs to be used as
an input to evaluate the T$_{s}$ which formulated based on a zero-dimensional

to the power system's ability to deliver electricity reliably and cheaply. As
average temperatures continue to rise, the ability of the transmission network
to meet demand is diminished. Higher temperatures lead to congestion by
reducing thermal limits of lines while simultaneously reducing generation
potential. Due to prohibitive costs and limited real estate for building new
lines, it is necessary to consider capacity expansion as well to improve the
functioning and efficiency of the grid. Optimal control, however, requires many
discrete choices, rendering fully accurate models intractable. Furthermore,
temperature changes will impact different regions and climate differently. As
such, it is necessary to model both temperature changes and transmission flows
with high spatial resolution. This work proposes a case study of the
transmission grid centered in Arizona, using a DC optimal power flow
mathematical formulation to plan for future transmission expansion and capacity
expansion to efficiently meet demand. The effects of rising temperatures on
transmission and generation are modeled at the regional level. Several classes
of valid inequalities are employed to speed up the solution process. Multiple

While this phenomenon has been noted, prior research has not sought to
understand these dominant individuals. Previous work has found that core
communicators are the gatekeepers of their teams' knowledge, and the
performance of these members was correlated with their teams' success. Building
on this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core
developers' attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change
over the course of their project. Method: We first used Social Network Analysis
(SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select
artifacts and central practitioners from ten different software development
teams. We then applied psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis
(CA) techniques to interpret the content of these practitioners' messages.
Finally, we inspected core developers' activities at various points in time

developers' attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors were linked to their
involvement in actual software development and the demands of their wider
project teams. However, core developers appeared to naturally possess high

likely benefit from strategies aimed at surrounding core developers with other

Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C Scenario Database to find that time
horizons that align with the 1.5 and 2 C global warming goals of the Paris

C = 9 [90% PI: 7, 16]. The most commonly used time horizon, 100 years,
underestimates methane emission metrics by 34-38% relative to the values we
calculate that align with the 2 C goal and 63-87% relative to the 1.5 C goal.
To best align emission metrics with the 1.5 C goal of the Paris Agreement, we

Optimal Reservoir Operations using Long Short-Term Memory Network,2021-09-07T18:16:22Z,"Asha Devi Singh, Anurag Singh","A reliable forecast of inflows to the reservoir is a key factor in the
optimal operation of reservoirs. Real-time operation of the reservoir based on
forecasts of inflows can lead to substantial economic gains. However, the
forecast of inflow is an intricate task as it has to incorporate the impacts of
climate and hydrological changes. Therefore, the major objective of the present
work is to develop a novel approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) for
the forecast of inflows. Real-time inflow forecast, in other words, daily
inflow at the reservoir helps in efficient operation of water resources. Also,
daily variations in the release can be monitored efficiently and the
reliability of operation is improved. This work proposes a naive anomaly

to forecast flood and drought for any deep learning-based prediction model. The
practicality of the approach has been demonstrated using the observed daily
data of the past 20 years from Bhakra Dam in India. The results of the
simulations conducted herein clearly indicate the supremacy of the LSTM
approach over the traditional methods of forecasting. Although, experiments are
run on data from Bhakra Dam Reservoir in India, LSTM model, and anomaly

consequences for societies and the environment. Population growth has come with
higher aggregate human welfare, but also climate change and biodiversity loss.
Based on the well-established empirical association and plausible causal
relationship between economic and population growth, we devised a novel method
for forecasting population based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.
Although not mechanistically causal, our model is intuitive, transparent,
replicable, and grounded on historical data. Our central finding is that a
richer world is likely to be associated with a lower population, an effect
especially pronounced in rapidly developing countries. In our baseline
scenario, where GDP per capita follows a business-as-usual trajectory, global
population is projected to reach 9.2 billion in 2050 and peak in 2062. With 50%
higher annual economic growth, population peaks even earlier, in 2056, and
declines to below 8 billion by the end of the century. Without any economic
growth after 2020, however, the global population will grow to 9.9 billion in
2050 continue rising thereafter. Economic growth has the largest effect on
low-income countries. The gap between the highest and lowest GDP scenarios
reaches almost 4 billion by 2100. Education and family planning are important
determinants of population growth, but economic growth is also likely to be a
driver of slowing population growth by changing incentives for childbearing.
Since economic growth could slow population growth, it will offset

Runaway emissions could lead to extremes in weather conditions around the world

However, the movement to a low-carbon energy supply can not happen
instantaneously due to the existing fossil-fuel infrastructure and the
requirement to maintain a reliable energy supply. Therefore, a low-carbon
transition is required, however, the decisions various stakeholders should make
over the coming decades to reduce these carbon emissions are not obvious. This
is due to many long-term uncertainties, such as electricity, fuel and
generation costs, human behaviour and the size of electricity demand. A well
choreographed low-carbon transition is, therefore, required between all of the
heterogenous actors in the system, as opposed to changing the behaviour of a
single, centralised actor. The objective of this thesis is to create a novel,

phenomena, such as melting and solidification, arising in numerous science and
engineering processes. The mathematical description is given by a Partial
Differential Equation (PDE) of the temperature distribution defined on a
spatial interval with a moving boundary, where the boundary represents the
liquid-solid interface and its dynamics are governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). The PDE-ODE coupling at the boundary is nonlinear
and creates a significant challenge for state estimation with provable
convergence and robustness. This tutorial article presents a state estimation
method based on PDE backstepping for the Stefan system, using measurements only
at the moving boundary. PDE backstepping observer design generates an observer
gain by employing a Volterra transformation of the observer error state into a
desirable target system, solving a Goursat-form PDE for the transformation's
kernel, and performing a Lyapunov analysis of the target observer error system.
The observer is applied to models of problems motivated by climate change and
the need for renewable energy storage: a model of polar ice dynamics and a
model of charging and discharging in lithium-ion batteries. The numerical
results for polar ice demonstrate a robust performance of the designed
estimator with respect to the unmodeled salinity effect in sea ice. The results

instantaneous and state-dependent delayed feedback, which itself may be
delayed. The state dependence introduces nonlinearity into an otherwise linear
system. We investigate the ensuing nonlinear dynamics with the case of
instantaneous state dependence as our starting point. We present the
bifurcation diagram in the parameter plane of the two feedback strengths
showing how periodic orbits bifurcate from a curve of Hopf bifurcations and
disappear along a curve where both period and amplitude grow beyond bound as
the orbits become saw-tooth shaped. We then `switch on' the delay within the
state-dependent feedback term, reflected by a parameter $b>0$. Our main
conclusion is that the new parameter $b$ has an immediate effect: as soon as
$b>0$ the bifurcation diagram for $b=0$ changes qualitatively and,
specifically, the nature of the limiting saw-tooth shaped periodic orbits
changes. Moreover, we show $-$ numerically and through center manifold analysis
$-$ that a degeneracy at $b=1/3$ of an equilibrium with a double real
eigenvalue zero leads to a further qualitative change and acts as an organizing
center for the bifurcation diagram.
  Our results demonstrate that state dependence in delayed feedback terms may
give rise to new dynamics and, moreover, that the observed dynamics may change
significantly when the state-dependent feedback depends on past states of the
system. This is expected to have implications for models arising in different
application contexts, such as models of human balancing and conceptual climate

can strongly impact isotope signals imprinted into the calcite of these
speleothems. Here, we show that in all the variety of conditions occurring in
nature only two distinct types of degassing exist. First, when a thin film of
calcareous solution comes in contact to cave air lower pCO2 value than that of
the aqueous CO2 in the water, molecular CO2 escapes by physical diffusion in
several seconds. In a next step lasting several ten seconds, pH and DIC in the
solution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the CO2 in the cave
atmosphere. This solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite.
During precipitation for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is
generated and escapes from the solution. This precipitation driven degassing is
active during precipitation only. We show that all variations of out gassing
proposed in the literature are either diffusive outgassing or precipitation
driven degassing and that diffusive outgassing has no influence on the isotope
composition of the HCO3 - pool and consequently on that of calcite. Its isotope
imprint is determined solely by precipitation driven degassing in contrast to
most explanations in the literature. We present a theoretical model of d13C and
d18O that explains the contributions of various parameters such as changes in
temperature, changes of pCO2 in the cave atmosphere, and changes in the drip
intervals to the isotope composition of calcite precipitated to the apex of the
stalagmite. We use this model to calculate quantitatively changes of d13C and
d18O observed in field experiments (Carlson et al., 2020) in agreement to their

  Parallelization and Leap-Format",2021-03-18T09:41:15Z,"Hang Cao, Liang Yuan, He Zhang, Yunquan Zhang","The Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) has been an important
research tool in the study of climate change for decades. As the demand for
high-resolution simulation is becoming urgent, the scalability and simulation
efficiency is faced with great challenges, especially for the
latitude-longitude mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose a highly
scalable 3D atmospheric general circulation model based on leap-format, namely
AGCM-3DLF. Firstly, it utilizes a 3D decomposition method allowing for
parallelism release in all three physical dimensions. Then the leap-format
difference computation scheme is adopted to maintain computational stability in
grid updating and avoid additional filtering at the high latitudes. A novel
shifting window communication algorithm is designed for parallelization of the
unified model. Furthermore, a series of optimizations are conducted to improve
the effectiveness of large-scale simulations. Experiment results in different
platforms demonstrate good efficiency and scalability of the model. AGCM-3DLF
scales up to the entire CAS-Xiandao1 supercomputer (196,608 CPU cores),
attaining the speed of 11.1 simulation-year-per-day (SYPD) at a high resolution
of 25KM. In addition, simulations conducted on the Sunway TaihuLight

A graph theoretical approach to the firebreak locating problem,2021-03-18T09:43:19Z,"Marc Demange, Alessia Di Fonso, Gabriele Di Stefano, Pierpaolo Vittorini","In the last decade, wildfires have become wider and more destructive. The
climate change and the growth of urban areas may further increase the
probability of incidence of large-scale fires. The risk of fire can be lowered
with preventive measures. Among them, firefighting lines are used to stop the
fire from spreading beyond them. Due to high costs of installation and
maintenance, their placement must be carefully planned. In this work, we
address the wildfire management problem from a theoretical point of view and
define a risk function to model the fire diffusion phenomena. The land is
modeled by a mixed graph in which vertices are areas subject to fire with a
certain probability while edges model the probability of fire spreading from
one area to another. To reduce the risk, we introduce the {\sc Windy Firebreak
Location} problem that addresses the optimal positioning of firefighting lines
under budget constraints. We study the complexity of the problem and prove its
hardness even when the graph is planar, bipartite, with maximum degree four and
the propagation probabilities are equal to one. We also show an efficient
polynomial time algorithm for particular instances on trees.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10115v1

challenges such as disaster prevention, land use monitoring, or tackling

of it remains unlabeled and thus inaccessible for supervised learning
algorithms. Transfer learning approaches can reduce the data requirements of
deep learning algorithms. However, most of these methods are pre-trained on
ImageNet and their generalization to remote sensing imagery is not guaranteed
due to the domain gap. In this work, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), an
effective pipeline to leverage unlabeled data for in-domain pre-training of
remote sensing representations. The SeCo pipeline is composed of two parts.
First, a principled procedure to gather large-scale, unlabeled and uncurated
remote sensing datasets containing images from multiple Earth locations at
different timestamps. Second, a self-supervised algorithm that takes advantage
of time and position invariance to learn transferable representations for
remote sensing applications. We empirically show that models trained with SeCo
achieve better performance than their ImageNet pre-trained counterparts and
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on multiple downstream tasks.
The datasets and models in SeCo will be made public to facilitate transfer

the performance of existing architectures. However, there is a tendency to
over-emphasize performance improvement while neglecting certain important
variables such as simplicity, versatility, the fairness of comparisons, and
energy efficiency. Overlooking these variables in architectural design and

"Warning signs for non-Markovian bifurcations: colour blindness and
  scaling laws",2021-06-15T19:00:11Z,"Christian Kuehn, Kerstin Lux, Alexandra Neamtu","Warning signs for tipping points (or critical transitions) have been very
actively studied. Although the theory has been applied successfully in models
and in experiments for many complex systems such as for tipping in climate
systems, there are ongoing debates, when warning signs can be extracted from
data. In this work, we shed light on this debate by considering different types
of underlying noise. Thereby, we significantly advance the general theory of
warning signs for nonlinear stochastic dynamics. A key scenario deals with
stochastic systems approaching a bifurcation point dynamically upon slow
parameter variation. The stochastic fluctuations are generically able to probe
the dynamics near a deterministic attractor to reveal critical slowing down.
Using scaling laws near bifurcations, one can then anticipate the distance to a
bifurcation. Previous warning signs results assume that the noise is Markovian,
most often even white. Here, we study warning signs for non-Markovian systems
including coloured noise and $\alpha$-regular Volterra processes (of which
fractional Brownian motion and the Rosenblatt process are special cases). We
prove that early warning scaling laws can disappear completely or drastically
change their exponent based upon the parameters controlling the noise process.
This provides a clear explanation, why applying standard warning signs results
to reduced models of complex systems may not agree with data-driven studies. We
demonstrate our results numerically in the context of a box model of the
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08374v3

"A Machine learning approach for rapid disaster response based on
  multi-modal data. The case of housing & shelter needs",2021-07-29T18:22:34Z,"Karla Saldana Ochoa, Tina Comes","Along with climate change, more frequent extreme events, such as flooding and
tropical cyclones, threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of poor and
vulnerable populations. One of the most immediate needs of people affected by a
disaster is finding shelter. While the proliferation of data on disasters is
already helping to save lives, identifying damages in buildings, assessing
shelter needs, and finding appropriate places to establish emergency shelters
or settlements require a wide range of data to be combined rapidly. To address
this gap and make a headway in comprehensive assessments, this paper proposes a
machine learning workflow that aims to fuse and rapidly analyse multimodal

This technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic
space that facilitates the prediction of individual variables. Each fused
numerical vector was fed into an unsupervised clustering algorithm called
Self-Organizing-Maps (SOM). The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future
cases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people
affected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for
assessments in the shelter and housing sector. To achieve such prediction, a

"A Channel-Aware Routing Protocol With Nearest Neighbor Regression For
  Underwater Sensor Networks",2021-08-11T06:50:59Z,"Boyu Diao, Chao Li, Qi Wang, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu","The underwater acoustic channel is one of the most challenging communication
channels. Due to periodical tidal and daily climatic variation, underwater
noise is periodically fluctuating, which result in the periodical changing of
acoustic channel quality in long-term. Also, time-variant channel quality leads
to routing failure. Routing protocols with acoustic channel estimation, namely
underwater channel-aware routing protocols are recently proposed to maintain
the routing performance. However, channel estimation algorithms for these
routing protocols are mostly linear and rarely consider periodicity of acoustic
channels. In this paper, we introduce acoustic channel estimation based on
nearest neighbor regression for underwater acoustic networks. We extend nearest
neighbor regression for SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) time series prediction,
providing an outstanding prediction accuracy for intricately periodical and
fluctuating received SNR time series. Moreover, we propose a quick search
algorithm and use statistical storage compression to optimize the time and
space complexity of the algorithm. In contrast with linear methods, this
algorithm significantly improves channel prediction accuracy (over three times
at most) on both simulation and sea trial data sets. With this channel
estimation method, we then propose a Depth-Based Channel-Aware Routing protocol
(DBCAR). Taking advantage of depth-greedy forwarding and channel-aware reliable

Moser Flow: Divergence-based Generative Modeling on Manifolds,2021-08-18T09:00:24Z,"Noam Rozen, Aditya Grover, Maximilian Nickel, Yaron Lipman","We are interested in learning generative models for complex geometries
described via manifolds, such as spheres, tori, and other implicit surfaces.
Current extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to
specific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We
introduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family
of continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to
the change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its
model (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus
the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear
differential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds.
Therefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating
through an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model
density explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an
ODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that
MF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions.
Empirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for
sampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in
density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs
on challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth

approach, to investigate cost-optimal and 100% renewable energy system
configurations. Within the scenarios, the electrification of private passenger
vehicles and cruise ships through shore-to-ship power supply was modelled to
assess its impact on the energy system and the necessary investment in storage.
Results show that for most scenarios of a system in 2030, a renewable energy

demand. The system's levelised costs of electricity range from 0.17 to 0.36
BBD/kWh in the cost-optimal scenarios and increase only moderately for 100%
renewable systems. Under the reasonable assumption of decreasing photovoltaic
investment costs, system costs of a 100% system may be lower than the current

Evaluating Fairness in Argument Retrieval,2021-08-23T23:19:35Z,"Sachin Pathiyan Cherumanal, Damiano Spina, Falk Scholer, W. Bruce Croft","Existing commercial search engines often struggle to represent different
perspectives of a search query. Argument retrieval systems address this
limitation of search engines and provide both positive (PRO) and negative (CON)
perspectives about a user's information need on a controversial topic (e.g.,
climate change). The effectiveness of such argument retrieval systems is
typically evaluated based on topical relevance and argument quality, without
taking into account the often differing number of documents shown for the
argument stances (PRO or CON). Therefore, systems may retrieve relevant
passages, but with a biased exposure of arguments. In this work, we analyze a
range of non-stochastic fairness-aware ranking and diversity metrics to
evaluate the extent to which argument stances are fairly exposed in argument
retrieval systems.
  Using the official runs of the argument retrieval task Touch\'e at CLEF 2020,
as well as synthetic data to control the amount and order of argument stances
in the rankings, we show that systems with the best effectiveness in terms of
topical relevance are not necessarily the most fair or the most diverse in

to topical relevance -- in argument retrieval settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10442v2
Feature Selection in High-dimensional Spaces Using Graph-Based Methods,2021-08-28T17:50:43Z,"Swarnadip Ghosh, Somabha Mukherjee, Divyansh Agarwal, Yichen He, Mingzhi Song, Xuejiao Pei","High-dimensional feature selection is a central problem in a variety of
application domains such as machine learning, image analysis, and genomics. In
this paper, we propose graph-based tests as a useful basis for feature
selection. We describe an algorithm for selecting informative features in
high-dimensional data, where each observation comes from one of $K$ different
distributions. Our algorithm can be applied in a completely nonparametric setup
without any distributional assumptions on the data, and it aims at outputting
those features in the data, that contribute the most to the overall
distributional variation. At the heart of our method is the recursive
application of distribution-free graph-based tests on subsets of the feature

"To Charge or to Sell? EV Pack Useful Life Estimation via LSTMs, CNNs,

performance and comfort, but above all, to help face climate change. Despite
their success, their cost is still a challenge. Lithium-ion batteries are one
of the most expensive EV components, and have become the standard for energy
storage in various applications. Precisely estimating the remaining useful life
(RUL) of battery packs can encourage their reuse and thus help to reduce the
cost of EVs and improve sustainability. A correct RUL estimation can be used to
quantify the residual market value of the battery pack. The customer can then
decide to sell the battery when it still has a value, i.e., before it exceeds
the end of life of the target application, so it can still be reused in a
second domain without compromising safety and reliability. This paper proposes
and compares two deep learning approaches to estimate the RUL of Li-ion
batteries: LSTM and autoencoders vs. CNN and autoencoders. The autoencoders are
used to extract useful features, while the subsequent network is then used to
estimate the RUL. Compared to what has been proposed so far in the literature,
we employ measures to ensure the method's applicability in the actual deployed
application. Such measures include (1) avoiding using non-measurable variables
as input, (2) employing appropriate datasets with wide variability and
different conditions, and (3) predicting the remaining ampere-hours instead of
the number of cycles. The results show that the proposed methods can generalize
on datasets consisting of numerous batteries with high variance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03585v2

  lateral fluxes",2021-10-14T08:25:42Z,"Jonas Beddrich, Shubhangi Gupta, Barbara Wohlmuth, Gabriele Chiogna","Alpine permafrost environments are highly vulnerable and sensitive to changes
in regional and global climate trends. Thawing and degradation of permafrost
has numerous adverse environmental, economic, and societal impacts.
Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations provide powerful tools for
predicting the degree of degradation and evolution of subsurface permafrost as
a result of global warming. A particularly significant characteristic of alpine
environments is the high variability in their topography and geomorphology
which drives large lateral thermal and fluid fluxes. Additionally, harsh winds,
extreme weather conditions, and various degrees of saturation have to be
considered. The combination of large lateral fluxes and unsaturated ground
makes alpine systems markedly different from Arctic permafrost environments and
general geotechnical ground freezing applications, and therefore, alpine
permafrost demands its own specialized modeling approaches. In this research
work, we present a multi-physics permafrost model tailored to alpine regions.
In particular, we resolve the ice-water phase transitions, unsaturated
conditions, and capillary actions, and account for the impact of the evolving
pore volume on fluid-matrix interactions. Moreover, the approach is
multi-dimensional, and therefore, inherently resolves fluxes along topographic
gradients. Through numerical cases studies based on the elevation profiles of
the two prominent peaks of the Zugspitze (DE) and the Matterhorn (CH), we show
the strong influence of topography driven thermal and fluid fluxes on active

nature of the underlying data and the Markov property, it is not sufficiently
possible to consider day to day dependencies in occupant behavior. An accurate

with daily time use survey data by using attention based models. In a first
step an autoregressive model is presented, which generates synthetic weekly
mobility schedules of individual occupants and thereby captures day to day

Optimal sampling and assay for soil organic carbon estimation,2021-01-19T01:23:37Z,Jacob V Spertus,"The world needs around 150 Pg of negative carbon emissions to mitigate
climate change. Global soils may provide a stable, sizeable reservoir to help
achieve this goal by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide as soil organic
carbon (SOC). In turn, SOC can support healthy soils and provide a multitude of
ecosystem benefits. To support SOC sequestration, researchers and policy makers
must be able to precisely measure the amount of SOC in a given plot of land.
SOC measurement is typically accomplished by taking soil cores selected at
random from the plot under study, mixing (compositing) some of them together,
and analyzing (assaying) the composited samples in a laboratory. Compositing
reduces assay costs, which can be substantial. Taking samples is also costly.
Given uncertainties and costs in both sampling and assay along with a desired
estimation precision, there is an optimal composite size that will minimize the
budget required to achieve that precision. Conversely, given a fixed budget,
there is a composite size that minimizes uncertainty. In this paper, we
describe and formalize sampling and assay for SOC and derive the optima for
three commonly used assay methods: dry combustion in an elemental analyzer,
loss-on-ignition, and mid-infrared spectroscopy. We demonstrate the utility of
this approach using data from a soil survey conducted in California. We give

Third the literature on the carbon footprint of researchers points to the high
level of some individual footprints. In a quest for consistency and role
models, scientists, teams of scientists or universities have started to
quantify their carbon footprints and debate on reduction options. Indeed,
measuring the carbon footprint of research activities requires tools designed
to tackle its specific features. In this paper, we present an open-source web
application, GES 1point5, developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists

estimate the carbon footprint of research activities in France. It operates at
the scale of research labs, i.e. laboratoires, which are the social structures
around which research is organized in France and the smallest decision making
entities in the French research system. The application allows French research
labs to compute their own carbon footprint along a standardized, open protocol.
The data collected in a rapidly growing network of labs will be used as part of
the Labos 1point5 project to estimate France's research carbon footprint. At
the time of submitting this manuscript, 89 research labs had engaged with GES

collapse in that country. Analysis of the raw and re-weighted data from

MiniV2G: An Electric Vehicle Charging Emulator,2021-01-27T22:14:27Z,"Luca Attanasio, Mauro Conti, Denis Donadel, Federico Turrin","The impact of global warming and the imperative to limit climate change have
stimulated the need to develop new solutions based on renewable energy sources.
One of the emerging trends in this endeavor are the Electric Vehicles (EVs),
which use electricity instead of traditional fossil fuels as a power source,
relying on the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) paradigm. The novelty of such a paradigm
requires careful analysis to avoid malicious attempts. An attacker can exploit
several surfaces, such as the remote connection between the Distribution Grid
and Charging Supply or the authentication system between the charging Supply
Equipment and the Electric Vehicles. However, V2G architecture's high cost and
complexity in implementation can restrain this field's research capability. In
this paper, we approach this limitation by proposing MiniV2G, an open-source
emulator to simulate Electric Vehicle Charging (EVC) built on top of Mininet
and RiseV2G. MiniV2G is particularly suitable for security researchers to study
and test real V2G charging scenarios. MiniV2G can reproduce with high fidelity
a V2G architecture to easily simulate an EV charging process. Finally, we
present a MiniV2G application and show how MiniV2G can be used to study V2G
communication and develop attacks and countermeasures that can be applied to
real systems. Since we believe our tool can be of great help for research in
this field, we also made it freely available.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11720v1

monitoring the temporal evolution of the detached haze layer (DHL) in Titan's
upper atmosphere (350-600 km). As reported by West et al. 2011 (GRL vol.38,
L06204) at the equator, we show that the DHL is present at all latitudes below
55{\deg}N during the northern winter (2004-2009). Then, it globally sunk and
disappeared in 2012. No permanent DHL was observed between 2012 and 2015. It's
only in late-2015, that a new structure emerged from the Northern hemisphere
and propagated to the equator. This new DHL is not as pronounced as in 2004 and
is much more complex than the one observed earlier. In one specific sequence,
in 2005, we were able to investigate the short time scale variability of the
DHL and no major changes was observed. When both side of the limb were visible
(dawn/dusk), we notice that the extinction of the DHL is slightly higher on the
dawn side. Additionally, during a polar flyby in 2009, we observed the
longitudinal variability of the DHL and spotted some local inhomogeneities.
Finally, comparisons with UVIS stellar occultations and General Climate Models
(GCMs) are both consistent with our findings. However, we noticed that the
timing of the DHL main pattern predicted by the GMCs can be off by up to
30{\deg} in solar longitude. All these observations bring new perspectives on
the seasonal cycle of Titan's upper atmosphere, the evolution of the DHL and
its interaction with the dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05384v1
Mean Field Models to Regulate Carbon Emissions in Electricity Production,2021-02-18T15:49:55Z,"Rene Carmona, Gokce Dayanikli, Mathieu Lauriere","The most serious threat to ecosystems is the global climate change fueled by
the uncontrolled increase in carbon emissions. In this project, we use mean
field control and mean field game models to analyze and inform the decisions of
electricity producers on how much renewable sources of production ought to be
used in the presence of a carbon tax. The trade-off between higher revenues
from production and the negative externality of carbon emissions is quantified
for each producer who needs to balance in real time reliance on reliable but
polluting (fossil fuel) thermal power stations versus investing in and
depending upon clean production from uncertain wind and solar technologies. We
compare the impacts of these decisions in two different scenarios: 1) the
producers are competitive and hopefully reach a Nash Equilibrium; 2) they
cooperate and reach a Social Optimum. We first prove that both problems have a
unique solution using forward-backward systems of stochastic differential
equations. We then illustrate with numerical experiments the producers'
behavior in each scenario. We further introduce and analyze the impact of a
regulator in control of the carbon tax policy, and we study the resulting
Stackelberg equilibrium with the field of producers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09434v2

crystalline silicon photovoltaics (PV), which is expected to reach the
tera-watt level in the next years and around 50TW in 2050. Upgraded
metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) has already demonstrated to be a viable
alternative to standard polysilicon in terms of cost and quality. This study
presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of UMG obtained by the FerroSolar
process. Moreover, it shows the environmental impacts of PV modules and
electricity generation based on this material. For this, an exhaustive review
of the life cycle inventory (LCI) of PV value chain, from metallurgical grade
silicon (MG-Si) down to electricity generation, has been carried out updating
inputs for all processes. The Balance of System (BoS) has also been updated
with real state of the art data for a fixed open ground large PV site (100 MW).
Two different electricity mixes, with low and high carbon intensities, have
been considered. The results reveal that for PV electricity generation using
UMG instead of polysilicon leads to an overall reduction of Climate change (CC)
emissions of over 20%, along with an improvement of the Energy Payback Time
(EPBT) of 25%, achieving significantly low values, 12 gCO2eq / kWhe and 0.52

the main contributor to the carbon and energy footprint of the produced
electricity, leaving the first place to PV module manufacturing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11571v1
Radiative cooling of colored paint based on Fe3+ doped Y2Ce2O7,2021-02-25T05:05:22Z,"Saichao Dang, Jingbo Xiang, Hongxin Yao, Fan Yang, Hong Ye","Materials with both low absorption of incoming solar radiation and high
emittance in mid-infrared band can be applied for daytime radiative cooling.
Current state-of-the-art materials for passive radiative cooling often utilize
a combination of solar reflector and infrared emitter by different structures,
or even by expensive nanofabricated photonic structures, which limits the
applications in practice. In this study, possessing these two specified
radiative properties, pure Y2Ce2O7 is demonstrated with a performance of
passive radiative cooling. With a bandgap at 375.7 nm, the prepared Y2Ce2O7
shows a high solar reflectance of 91%, while with lattice strain and distortion
of various bonds (e.g., Y-O, Ce-O), it also shows a high emittance of 0.96 in
MIR band. More attracting, the aesthetics performance of Y2Ce2O7 can be
modified by doping Fe3+ ions to change its color from ivory white to light
yellow or red with high NIR reflection and MIR emission, indicating that the
Y2Ce2-xFexO7 shows a better cooling performance than a common paint with a
similar color. According to the field demonstration of cooling performance at
noon time, the Y2Ce2O7 and Y2Ce1.9Fe0.1O7 paints are 2.2 K and 1.8 K lower than
the common white and umber paints, respectively, while at night, all paints are
2.3 K lower than the ambient air. If applied on the envelop of a building, the
simulation shows that the Y2Ce2O7 and Y2Ce1.9Fe0.1O7 paints save 54.45% and
21.14% energy consumption compared with a common white and umber paints,

diagnostic tasks. However, a clinically relevant question that practitioners

Current methods for such a problem often require domain knowledge, and are

problem as a one-to-many forecasting problem from multimodal data. Inspired by
a clinical decision-making process with two agents -- a radiologist and a
general practitioner, we model a prognosis prediction problem with two
transformer-based components that share information between each other. The
first block in this model aims to analyze the imaging data, and the second
block leverages the internal representations of the first one as inputs, also
fusing them with auxiliary patient data. We show the effectiveness of our
method in predicting the development of structural knee osteoarthritis changes
over time. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of various performance metrics. In

critical task is to assess the paleoclimate significance of single line
profiles along the main core axis, which we show is a scale-dependent problem
for which advanced image analysis methods are critical. Another important issue
is the evaluation of post-depositional layer changes, for which the chemical
images provide rich information. Accordingly, the time is ripe to begin an

EU's strategy to fight climate change and an important device for plummeting
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in an economically efficient manner. The power
industry has switched to an auction-based allocation system at the onset of
Phase III of the EU ETS to bring economic efficiency by negating windfall
profits that have been resulted from grandfathered allocation of allowances in
the previous phases. In this work, we analyze and simulate the interaction of
oligopolistic generators in an electricity market with a game-theoretical
framework where the electricity and the emissions markets interact in a
two-stage electricity market. For analytical simplicity, we assume a single
futures market where the electricity is committed at the futures price, and the
emissions allowance is contracted in advance, prior to a spot market where the
energy and allowances delivery takes place. Moreover, a coherent risk measure
is applied (Conditional Value at Risk) to model both risk averse and risk
neutral generators and a two-stage stochastic optimization setting is
introduced to deal with the uncertainty of renewable capacity, demand,
generation, and emission costs. The performance of the proposed equilibrium
model and its main properties are examined through realistic numerical
simulations. Our results show that renewable generators are surging and
substituting conventional generators without compromising social welfare.
Hence, both renewable deployment and emission allowance auctioning are

current technologies and costs. However, recent episodes of extreme weather
conditions, probably associated with climate change, cast shades of doubt on
whether the resulting generation portfolios are sufficiently robust to assure,
at all times, a suitable balance between generation and demand, when adverse
conditions are faced. To address this issue, this work elaborates a methodology
intended to determine a sustainable electricity system that can endure extreme
weather conditions, which are likely to occur. First, using hourly production
and demand data from the last decade, along with estimates of new uses of
electricity, a worst-case scenario is constructed, including the storage
capacity and additional photovoltaic power which are needed to serve the demand
on an hourly basis. Next, several key parameters which may have a significant
influence on the LCOE are considered, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out
to determine their real impact, significance and potential trends. The proposed
methodology is then applied to the Spanish system. The results show that, under

reduce or eliminate the chances of someone dying from a wildfire. A fire
detection system should be efficient and accurate with respect to extinguishing
wildfires in their earlier stages to prevent the spread of them along with
their consequences. Computer Vision is potentially a more reliable, fast, and
widespread method we need. The current research in the field of preliminary
fire detection has several problems related to unrepresentative data being used
to train models and their existing varied amounts of label imbalance in the
classes of their dataset. We propose a more representative and evenly
distributed data through better settings, lighting, atmospheres, etc., and
class distribution in the entire dataset. After thoroughly examining the
results of this research, it can be inferred that they supported the datasets
strengths by being a viable resource when tested in the real world on
unfamiliar data. This is evident since as the model trains on the dataset, it
is able to generalize on it, hence confirming this is a viable Machine Learning

with 169 targets, to serve as a plan for solving the world's problems and
achieving a more sustainable future. This is modeled as a graph with the
targets as nodes, and with the interaction between targets as the edges of the
graph. An exhaustive binary comparison is done to analyze the intra- and
inter-goal target interactions, entailing over 14000 comparisons. The task is
to assign a 'color' to an edge: positive (indivisible), zero (consistent) or
negative (cancelling). This is done via a panel of experts who will evaluate
the target interactions, through a web application that was developed for
coloring the edges. This is an on-going study, and so far, of the 1256 edges
colored, only 36 are cancelling (negative), or 2.86%; more than 97% are
positive interactions. So far, the ""most negative"" interactions involve:
""Climate Change""; ""Life Below Water""; ""Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"";
and ""Decent Work and Economic Growth"". Most useful for planning might be the
'graph of beautiful targets' feature, which shows target with non-negative
interactions, and how they connect to each other. These are the targets that
may be worked on simultaneously, and currently has more than 130 nodes. This

The results also show that inside of the evacuation warning/order zones, the

engineered sequestration of mineral CO2 in these formations could help reduce
the atmospheric emissions and cope with climate change. In this study, we
present two reactive percolation experiments performed on a natural
serpentinite dredged from the ultraslow South-West Indian Oceanic Ridge. The
serpentinite cores (length 3-4 cm and dia. 5.6 mm) were subjected for about 10
days to the continuous injection of a NaHCO3-saturated brine at respectively
160{\deg}C and 280{\deg}C. Petrographic and petrophysical results as well as
outlet fluid compositions were compared to numerical batch simulations
performed with the PHREEQC open software allowing to reconstruct the
mineralogical evolution of both cores. The most striking observation is the
fast and dramatic decrease of the permeability for both experiments principally
due to the precipitation of carbonates. On the contrary, serpentine was found
to be less impacting as it precipitates in low-flow zones, out of the main
percolation paths. In total, about 5.6% of the total injected CO2 was retained
in the core, at 280{\deg}C. In the same time, hydrogen was consistently

physics-based numerical models or data based models. Physical modeling and
machine learning are traditionally considered as two unrelated fields for the
sea subsurface temperature prediction task, with very different scientific
paradigms (physics-driven and data-driven). However, we believe both methods
are complementary to each other. Physical modeling methods can offer the
potential for extrapolation beyond observational conditions, while data-driven

interdependence patterns of extreme rainfall events (EREs) still needs to be
further explored. To this end, we propose a top-down complex-network-based
clustering workflow, with the combination of consensus clustering and mutual
correspondences. Consensus clustering provides a reliable community structure
under each dataset, while mutual correspondences build a matching relationship
between different community structures obtained from different datasets. This
approach ensures the robustness of the identified structures when multiple
datasets are available. By applying it simultaneously to two satellite-derived
precipitation datasets, we identify consistent synchronized structures of EREs

jump' over both East Asia and West Africa and the mid-summer drought over
Central America and southern Mexico. Through a case study related to the Asian
summer monsoon (ASM), we verify that the intraseasonal changes of upper-level
atmospheric conditions are preserved by significant connections within the

sustainability can keep the Earth in a civilization-friendly state. As hotspots
for (green) innovation and experimentation, cities could play an important role
in this transition. They are also known to profit from each other's ideas, with
policy and technology innovations spreading to other cities. In this way,
cities can be conceptualized as nodes in a globe-spanning learning network. The
dynamics of this process are important for society's response to climate change
and other challenges, but remain poorly understood on a macroscopic level. In
this contribution, we develop an approach to identify whether network-based
complex contagion effects are a feature of sustainability policy adoption by
cities, based on dose-response contagion and surrogate data models. We apply
this methodology to an example data set, comprising empirical data on the
spreading of a public transport innovation (Bus Rapid Transit Systems) and a
global inter-city connection network based on scheduled flight routes. We find
evidence pointing towards a contagious spreading process which cannot be
explained by either the network structure or the increase in global adoption
rate alone. This suggests that the actions of a city's abstract ""global
neighborhood"" within the network of cities may be an important factor in which
policies and innovations are implemented, with potential connections to the
emergence of social tipping processes. The methodology is generic, and can be
used to compare the predictive power for innovation spreading of different

renewable energy (VRE) power plants, such as wind and photovoltaic power
plants, leads to a 100% renewable energy supply in 2030 because of its inherent
exponential growth function. This behavior is related to the exponential cost
reduction of its generated energy and the nearly unconstrained available
potential of its natural resources. The cost reduction results from the
continuous improvements in development, research, manufacturing, and
installation, also showing a growth of its installation power per power plant
or aero generator. We prove that if the historic exponential growth is followed
in the future, it is possible to decarbonize the world's electric energy
systems' power supply in 2026. Furthermore, the global demand on primary energy
can be supplied in 2030, which leads to the total suppression of CO2 emissions
related to the energy need of humanity. Because of the related cost reduction,
energy costs are not anymore relevant. Our extrapolation is based on the
continuation of the historic growth functions of the globally installed PV and
the wind power plants, and we also discuss the conditions necessary to enable a
transition to such a 100% renewable energy production. Considering a
non-constrained growth of VRE power plants' installation power, decarbonization
related to energy generation and use can be accomplished in a much shorter time

learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these
models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study

temporal overlap of Landsat-5 TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV sensors. We train a
convolutional neural network to predict fractional land cover maps from 30m
Landsat-5 TM data. The reference land cover fractions are estimated from a
hard-classified 5.8m LISS-IV image for Bengaluru from 2011. Further, we

spatial and temporal non uniformity of corrosion induced degradation in rebar,
and eliminates the assumption of uniform mass loss and its linear variation
with time as per available literature that uses classical approach of Faraday's
law. The model is validated experimentally with accelerated corrosion setup
designed to induce partial corrosion. Further, the possibility of extending
this model to monitor natural corrosion is discussed with required
modifications. Unlike previous studies, pore saturation (PS) is continuously
monitored and its existing experimental correlations with electrolyte
conductivity and oxygen diffusivity in the vicinity of partial corrosion are
adopted so that the model can be extended to simulate natural corrosion. These
evaluations can be made completely nondestructive and in real time to capture
the influence of local environment. The proposed methodology also captures the
effect of differential aeration pertaining to local exposure. Therefore, the
challenges in incorporating influence of local environment by the use of
alternative parameters such as relative humidity from real climate change

strongly indicate that both Antarctic and tropical O3 holes must arise from an
identical physical mechanism, for which the cosmic-ray-driven electron reaction

Therefore, this study adopted multi-year and large-scale air quality data to
explore the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3, and proposed a
concept called dynamic similar hu lines to replace the single fixed division in
the previous research. Furthermore, this study discussed the causes of
distribution patterns quantitatively with geographical detector and random
forest. The causes included natural factors and anthropogenic factors. And
these factors could be divided into three parts according to the
characteristics of spatial distribution: broadly changing with longitude,
changing with latitude, and having local characteristics. Overall, regions with
relatively more densely population, higher GDP, lower altitude, higher
humidity, higher atmospheric pressure, higher surface temperature, less
sunshine hours and more accumulated precipitation often corresponds to positive
correlation coefficient between PM2.5 and O3, no matter in which season. The
parts with opposite conditions that mentioned above are essentially negative
correlation coefficient. And what's more, humidity, global surface temperature,
air temperature and accumulated precipitation are four decisive factors to form
the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3. In general, collaborative

which include both facilitative and competitive interactions. Exchanges between
compartments (coastal pelagic cells, coastal resting cells on the seabed, and
open ocean pelagic cells) are controlled by hydrodynamical parameters to which
the sensitivity of the model is assessed. We consider two models, i.e., with
and without a saturating effect of the interactions on the growth rates. Our
results are consistent between models, and show that a seed bank allows to
maintain all species in the community over 30 years. Indeed, a fraction of the
species are vulnerable to extinction at specific times within the year, but
this process is buffered by their survival in their resting stage. We thus
highlight the potential role of the seed bank in the recurrent re-invasion of
the coastal community, and of coastal environments in re-seeding oceanic
regions. Moreover, the seed bank enables populations to tolerate stronger
interactions within the community as well as more severe changes to the
environment, such as those predicted in a climate change context. Our study
therefore shows how resting stages may help phytoplanktonic diversity
maintenance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11637v2
"B-ETS: A Trusted Blockchain-based Emissions Trading System for
  Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks",2021-02-18T21:52:56Z,"Lam Duc Nguyen, Amari N. Lewis, Israel Leyva-Mayorga, Amelia Regan, Petar Popovski","Urban areas are negatively impacted by Carbon Dioxide (CO2 ) and Nitrogen
Oxide (NOx) emissions. In order to achieve a cost-effective reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions and to combat climate change, the European Union (EU)
introduced an Emissions Trading System (ETS) where organizations can buy or
receive emission allowances as needed. The current ETS is a centralized one,
consisting of a set of complex rules. It is currently administered at the
organizational level and is used for fixed-point sources of pollution such as
factories, power plants, and refineries. However, the current ETS cannot
efficiently cope with vehicle mobility, even though vehicles are one of the
primary sources of CO2 and NOx emissions. In this study, we propose a new
distributed Blockchain-based emissions allowance trading system called B-ETS.
This system enables transparent and trustworthy data exchange as well as
trading of allowances among vehicles, relying on vehicle-to-vehicle
communication. In addition, we introduce an economic incentive-based mechanism
that appeals to individual drivers and leads them to modify their driving
behavior in order to reduce emissions. The efficiency of the proposed system is
studied through extensive simulations, showing how increased vehicle
connectivity can lead to a reduction of the emissions generated from those
vehicles. We demonstrate that our method can be used for full life-cycle
monitoring and fuel economy reporting. This leads us to conjecture that the
proposed system could lead to important behavioral changes among the drivers",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13477v2
"Analyzing the ""Sleeping Giants"" Activism Model in Brazil",2021-05-16T21:47:30Z,"BÃ¡rbara Gomes Ribeiro, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, VirgÃ­lio Almeida, Wagner Meira Jr","In 2020, amidst the COVID pandemic and a polarized political climate, the
Sleeping Giants online activist movement gained traction in Brazil. Its
rationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation by harming the
advertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its
international counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against
media outlets using Twitter to ask companies to remove ads from the targeted
outlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative characterization of this
activism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between May
and September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and
Google Trends, toxicity and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese
language, and an annotated corpus of SGB's tweets. Our key findings were
threefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely
successful (with 83.85\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively)
and that user pressure was correlated to the speed of companies' responses.
Second, there were no significant changes in the online attention and the user
engagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six months that
followed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement).
Third, we observed that user interactions with companies changed only
transiently, even if the companies did not respond to SGB's request. Overall,
our results paint a nuanced portrait of internet activism. On the one hand,
they suggest that SGB was successful in getting companies to boycott specific
media outlets, which may have harmed their advertisement revenue stream. On the
other hand, they also suggest that the activist movement did not impact the
online attention these media outlets received nor the online image of companies
that did not respond positively to their requests.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07523v3

Meanwhile our understanding of whether and how changes in vegetation cover
could trigger abrupt transitions in moisture regimes remains incomplete. This
challenge calls for better evidence as well as for the theoretical concepts to
describe it. Here we briefly summarise the theoretical questions surrounding
the role of vegetation cover in the dynamics of a moist atmosphere. We discuss
the previously unrecognized sensitivity of local wind power to condensation
rate as revealed by our analysis of the continuity equation for a gas mixture.
Using the framework of condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics, we then show
that with the temperature contrast between land and ocean increasing up to a
critical threshold, ocean-to-land moisture transport reaches a tipping point
where it can stop or even reverse. Land-ocean temperature contrasts are
affected by both global and regional processes, in particular, by the surface
fluxes of sensible and latent heat that are strongly influenced by vegetation.
Our results clarify how a disturbance of natural vegetation cover, e.g., by
deforestation, can disrupt large-scale atmospheric circulation and moisture
transport. In view of the increasing pressure on natural ecosystems, successful
strategies of mitigating climate change require taking into account the impact
of vegetation on moist atmospheric dynamics. Our analysis provides a
theoretical framework to assess this impact. The available data for Eurasia
indicate that the observed climatological land-ocean temperature contrasts are
close to the threshold. This can explain the increasing fluctuations in the
continental water cycle including droughts and floods and signifies a yet
greater potential importance for large-scale forest conservation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12880v1
Simulation study on the fleet performance of shared autonomous bicycles,2021-06-17T17:47:08Z,"Naroa Coretti SÃ¡nchez, IÃ±igo Martinez, Luis Alonso Pastor, Kent Larson","Rethinking cities is now more imperative than ever, as society faces global
challenges such as population growth and climate change. The design of cities
can not be abstracted from the design of its mobility system, and, therefore,
efficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout the
city in an ecological way. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system would combine
the most relevant benefits of vehicle sharing, electrification, autonomy, and
micro-mobility, increasing the efficiency and convenience of bicycle-sharing
systems and incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities in an
environmentally friendly way. Due to the uniqueness and radical novelty of
introducing autonomous driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and the
inherent complexity of these systems, there is a need to quantify the potential
impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper
presents an ad-hoc agent-based simulator that provides an in-depth
understanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in
realistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction.
In addition, this work describes the impact of different parameters on system
efficiency and service quality and quantifies the extent to which an autonomous
system would outperform current bicycle-sharing schemes. The obtained results
show that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based
system and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can
provide overall improved performance and user experience even with no
rebalancing. These findings indicate that the remarkable efficiency of an
autonomous bicycle-sharing system could compensate for the additional cost of
autonomous bicycles.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09694v2
Surrogate-based variational data assimilation for tidal modelling,2021-06-08T07:39:38Z,"Rem-Sophia Mouradi, CÃ©dric Goeury, Olivier Thual, Fabrice Zaoui, Pablo Tassi","Data assimilation (DA) is widely used to combine physical knowledge and
observations. It is nowadays commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric
calibration. In a context of climate change, old calibrations can not
necessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA
computational cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be
reanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling represent therefore interesting
perspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions as hybridization
between ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages
(efficiency, non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo
(MC) type sampling, which often requires considerable increase of the ensemble
size for better efficiency, therefore representing a computational burden in
ensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods to replace
the complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR
directly inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint
parameter-state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear
metamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states are POD reduced then
learned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear
metamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose
minimum can be analytically computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at
negligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling error covariance matrix is
given for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based
DA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared
to classical 3DVAR on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in
particular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR, showing good convergence to classical
3DVAR and robustness to noise.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11926v1

Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies,
we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning
of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success,
the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines
into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that
explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour,
large-scale migrations, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate
change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future
research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is

"ESG and Sovereign Risk: What is Priced in by the Bond Market and Credit
  Rating Agencies?",2021-10-13T10:21:51Z,"RaphaÃ«l Semet, Thierry Roncalli, Lauren Stagnol","In this paper, we examine the materiality of ESG on country creditworthiness
from a credit risk and fundamental analysis viewpoint. We first determine the
ESG indicators that are most relevant when it comes to explaining the sovereign
bond yield, after controlling the effects of traditional fundamental variables
such as economic strength and credit rating. We also emphasize the major themes
that are directly useful for investors when assessing the country risk premium.
At the global level, we notice that these themes mainly belong to the E and G
pillars. Those results confirm that extra-financial criteria are integrated
into bond pricing. However, we also identify a clear difference between
high-and middle-income countries. Indeed, whereas the S pillar is lagging for
the highest income countries, it is nearly as important as the G pillar for the
middle-income ones. Second, we determine which ESG metrics are indirectly
valuable for assessing a country's solvency. More precisely, we attempt to
infer credit rating solely from extra-financial criteria, that is the ESG
indicators that are priced in by credit rating agencies. We find that there is
no overlap between the set of indicators that predict credit ratings and those
that directly explain sovereign bond yields. The results also highlight the
importance of the G and S pillars when predicting credit ratings. The E pillar
is lagging, suggesting that credit rating agencies are undermining the impact
of climate change and environmental topics on country creditworthiness. This is
consistent with the traditional view that social and governance issues are the
main drivers of the sovereign risk, because they are more specific and less
global than environmental issues. Finally, taking these different results
together, this research shows that opposing extra-financial and fundamental
analysis does not make a lot of sense.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06617v1

  Computation of transmission spectra using a 1D, 2D, or 3D atmosphere
  structure",2021-10-22T14:16:14Z,"AurÃ©lien Falco, Tiziano Zingales, William Pluriel, JÃ©rÃ©my Leconte","Considering the relatively high precision that will be reached by future
observatories, it has recently become clear that one dimensional (1D)
atmospheric models, in which the atmospheric temperature and composition of a
planet are considered to vary only in the vertical, will be unable to represent
exoplanetary transmission spectra with a sufficient accuracy. This is
particularly true for warm to (ultra-) hot exoplanets because the atmosphere is
unable to redistribute all the energy deposited on the dayside, creating a
strong thermal and often compositional dichotomy on the planet. This situation
is exacerbated by transmission spectroscopy, which probes the terminator
region. This is the most heterogeneous region of the atmosphere. However, if
being able to compute transmission spectra from 3D atmospheric structures (from
a global climate model, e.g.) is necessary to predict realistic observables, it
is too computationally expensive to be used in a data inversion framework. For
this reason, there is a need for a medium-complexity 2D approach that captures
the most salient features of the 3D model in a sufficiently fast
implementation. With this in mind, we present a new open-source documented
version of Pytmosph3R that handles the computation of transmission spectra for
atmospheres with up to three spatial dimensions and can account for time
variability. Taking the example of an ultra hot Jupiter, we illustrate how the
changing orientation of the planet during the transit can allow us to probe the
horizontal variations in the atmosphere. We further implement our algorithm in
TauREx to allow the community to perform 2D retrievals. We describe our
extensive cross-validation benchmarks and discuss the accuracy and numerical
performance of each model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11799v2

caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Ticks belonging to
the genus \textit{Hyalomma} are the main vectors and reservoir for the virus.
It is maintained in nature in an endemic vertebrate-tick-vertebrate cycle.
CCHFV is prevalent in wide geographical areas including Asia, Africa,
South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Over the last decade, several
outbreaks of CCHFV have been observed in Europe, mainly in Mediterranean
countries. Due to the high case/fatality ratio of CCHFV in human sometimes, it
is of great importance for public health. Climate change and the invasion of
CCHFV vectors in Central Europe suggest that the establishment of the
transmission in Central Europe may be possible in future. We developed a
compartment-based nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system to
model the disease transmission cycle including blood sucking ticks, livestock
and human. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ shows
that decreasing in the tick survival time is an efficient method to eradicate
the disease. The model supports us in understanding the influence of different
model parameters on the spread of CCHFV. Tick to tick transmission through
co-feeding and the CCHFV circulation through trasstadial and transovarial
stages are important factors to sustain the disease cycle. The proposed model
dynamics are calibrated through an empirical multi-country analysis and
multidimensional scaling reveals the disease-parameter sets of different
countries burdened with CCHF are different. This necessary information may help

unprecedented decreases in both global energy demand and GHG emissions. Yet a
little known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system

from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the
pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system,
representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector
that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share
of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy,
wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the
first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand
(-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in
2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants
supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).
Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored
low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower
midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most

rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus
to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon

critical swimming speed (Ucrit), metabolic rates, aerobic scope, and optimal
swim speed were measured. Aerobic scope and Ucrit were highest in

aerobic scope showed a similar pattern to factorial aerobic scope. Our results
are generally in agreement with previously observed distribution patterns for

formation. We explore trends in cloud properties for a sample of five giant gas
planets: WASP-43b, WASP-18b, HAT-P-7b, WASP-103b, and WASP-121b. This provides
a reference frame for cloud properties for the JWST targets WASP-43b and

asymmetries, and if the location of inner boundary of a 3D GCM matters for the
clouds that form. The large day/night temperature differences of ultra-hot
Jupiters cause large chemical asymmetries: cloud-free days but cloudy nights,
atomic vs. molecular gases and respectively different mean molecular weights,
deep thermal ionospheres vs. low-ionised atmospheres, undepleted vs enhanced
C/O. WASP-18b, as the heaviest planet in the sample, has the lowest global C/O.
The global climate may be considered as similar amongst ultra-hot Jupiters, but
different to that of hot gas giants. The local weather, however, is individual
for each planet since the local thermodynamic conditions, and hence the local
cloud and gas properties, differ. The morning and the evening terminator of
ultra-hot Jupiters will carry signatures of their strong chemical asymmetry
such that ingress/egress asymmetries can be expected. An increased C/O ratio is
a clear sign of cloud formation, making cloud modelling a necessity when
utilizing C/O (or other mineral ratios) as tracer for planet formation. The
changing geometrical extension of the atmosphere from the day to the nightside

diurnal cycle of the Earth's Radiation Budget at the top of the atmosphere

continuous temporal coverage of the geostationary orbit is the fixed viewing
geometry. As a consequence, imperfections in the angular distribution models
(ADMs) used in the radiance-to-flux conversion process or residual
angular-dependent narrowband-to-broadband conversion errors can result in
systematic errors of the estimated radiative fluxes. In this work, focusing on
clear-sky reflected TOA observations, we compare the overlapping views from
Meteosat Second Generation satellites at 0{\deg} and 41.5{\deg}E longitude
which enable a quantification of viewing-angle-dependent differences. Using
data derived from SEVIRI, we identify some of the main sources of
discrepancies, and show that they can be significantly reduced at the level of
one month. This is achieved, separately for each satellite, via a masking
procedure followed by an empirical fit at the pixel-level that takes into
account all the clear-sky data from that satellite, calculated separately per
timeslot of the day, over the month of November 2016. The method is then
applied to each month of 2017, and gives a quadratic mean of the albedo
root-mean squared difference over the dual-view region which is comparable from
month to month, with a 2017 average value of 0.01. Sources of discrepancies
include the difficulty to estimate the flux over the sunglint ocean region
close to the limbs, the fact that the data processing does not include
dedicated angular distribution models for the aerosol-over-ocean case, and the
existence of an observer-dependent diurnal-asymmetry artefact affecting the

predictors on equal footing, extending multiple previous works; second, the use
of fourteen (14) different ML techniques, also on equal footing, to optimize
the immense Big Data parameter space created by these many predictors; third,
the establishment of a robust, three-pronged communication effort oriented
toward policy makers, space-weather stakeholders and the wider public.
FLARECAST pledged to make all its data, codes and infrastructure openly
available worldwide. The combined use of 170+ properties (a total of 209
predictors are now available) in multiple ML algorithms, some of which were
designed exclusively for the project, gave rise to changing sets of
best-performing predictors for the forecasting of different flaring levels. At
the same time, FLARECAST reaffirmed the importance of rigorous training and
testing practices to avoid overly optimistic pre-operational prediction
performance. In addition, the project has (a) tested new and revisited
physically intuitive flare predictors and (b) provided meaningful clues toward
the transition from flares to eruptive flares, namely, events associated with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These leads, along with the FLARECAST data,
algorithms and infrastructure, could help facilitate integrated space-weather
forecasting efforts that take steps to avoid effort duplication. In spite of

strategies to achieve the net emissions reductions that would be required to
follow a pathway that limits global warming to 1.5{\deg}C with no or limited

inevitable increase in the share of renewable generation in the energy mix and
a drastic decrease in the total consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, this
thesis studies the integration of renewables in power systems by investigating
forecasting and decision-making tools. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
power plants, renewable energy is subject to uncertainty. Most of the
generation technologies based on renewable sources are non-dispatchable, and
their production is stochastic and complex to predict in advance. A high share
of renewables is challenging for power systems that have been designed and
sized for dispatchable units. In this context, probabilistic forecasts, which
aim at modeling the distribution of all possible future realizations, have
become a vital tool to equip decision-makers, hopefully leading to better
decisions in energy applications. This thesis focuses on two main research
questions: (1) How to produce reliable probabilistic renewable generation
forecasts, consumption, and electricity prices? (2) How to make decisions with
uncertainty using probabilistic forecasts? The thesis perimeter is the energy
management of ""small"" systems such as microgrids at a residential scale on a

  Satellite Imagery With Deep Ensembles",2021-11-25T16:21:28Z,"Alexander Becker, Stefania Russo, Stefano Puliti, Nico Lang, Konrad Schindler, Jan Dirk Wegner","Monitoring and managing Earth's forests in an informed manner is an important
requirement for addressing challenges like biodiversity loss and climate
change. While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments
provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire
countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this
work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest
structure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely
available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2
optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images into maps of five
different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height,
density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on
reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and
demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving
normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable.
Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep
learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty
information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for
downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for
decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the
accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted
uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the
five forest structure variables.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13154v3

An interesting side effect of these measurements is that they served to spot
phase changes in the frozen salt solutions, even for very low salt

Binary Change Guided Hyperspectral Multiclass Change Detection,2021-12-08T13:17:24Z,"Meiqi Hu, Chen Wu, Bo Du, Liangpei Zhang","Characterized by tremendous spectral information, hyperspectral image is able
to detect subtle changes and discriminate various change classes for change
detection. The recent research works dominated by hyperspectral binary change
detection, however, cannot provide fine change classes information. And most
methods incorporating spectral unmixing for hyperspectral multiclass change
detection (HMCD), yet suffer from the neglection of temporal correlation and
error accumulation. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised Binary Change
Guided hyperspectral multiclass change detection Network (BCG-Net) for HMCD,
which aims at boosting the multiclass change detection result and unmixing
result with the mature binary change detection approaches. In BCG-Net, a novel
partial-siamese united-unmixing module is designed for multi-temporal spectral
unmixing, and a groundbreaking temporal correlation constraint directed by the
pseudo-labels of binary change detection result is developed to guide the
unmixing process from the perspective of change detection, encouraging the
abundance of the unchanged pixels more coherent and that of the changed pixels
more accurate. Moreover, an innovative binary change detection rule is put
forward to deal with the problem that traditional rule is susceptible to
numerical values. The iterative optimization of the spectral unmixing process
and the change detection process is proposed to eliminate the accumulated
errors and bias from unmixing result to change detection result. The

same terrain is necessary for change detection, object
classification/segmentation, and map-making tasks. However, traditional RRN
models are not robust, disturbing by object change, and RRN models precisely
considering object change can not robustly obtain the no-change set. This paper
proposes auto robust relative radiometric normalization methods via latent
change noise modeling. They utilize the prior knowledge that no change points
possess small-scale noise under relative radiometric normalization and that
change points possess large-scale radiometric noise after radiometric
normalization, combining the stochastic expectation maximization method to
quickly and robustly extract the no-change set to learn the relative
radiometric normalization mapping functions. This makes our model theoretically
grounded regarding the probabilistic theory and mathematics deduction.
Specifically, when we select histogram matching as the relative radiometric
normalization learning scheme integrating with the mixture of Gaussian
noise(HM-RRN-MoG), the HM-RRN-MoG model achieves the best performance. Our
model possesses the ability to robustly against clouds/fogs/changes. Our method
naturally generates a robust evaluation indicator for RRN that is the no-change
set root mean square error. We apply the HM-RRN-MoG model to the latter
vegetation/water change detection task, which reduces the radiometric contrast
and NDVI/NDWI differences on the no-change set, generates consistent and

Multipartition model for multiple change point identification,2021-07-23T20:48:03Z,"Ricardo C. Pedroso, Rosangela H. Loschi, Fernando AndrÃ©s Quintana","Among the main goals in multiple change point problems are the estimation of
the number and positions of the change points, as well as the regime structure
in the clusters induced by those changes. The product partition model (PPM) is
a widely used approach for the detection of multiple change points. The
traditional PPM assumes that change points split the set of time points in
random clusters that define a partition of the time axis. It is then typically
assumed that sampling model parameter values within each of these blocks are
identical. Because changes in different parameters of the observational model
may occur at different times, the PPM thus fails to identify the parameters
that experienced those changes. A similar problem may occur when detecting
changes in multivariate time series. To solve this important limitation, we
introduce a multipartition model to detect multiple change points occurring in
several parameters at possibly different times. The proposed model assumes that
the changes experienced by each parameter generate a different random partition
of the time axis, which facilitates identifying which parameters have changed
and when they do so. We discuss a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler scheme to
implement posterior simulation under the proposed model. We apply the proposed
model to identify multiple change points in Normal means and variances and
evaluate the performance of the proposed model through Monte Carlo simulations
and data illustrations. Its performance is compared with some previously
proposed approaches for change point problems. These studies show that the
proposed model is competitive and enriches the analysis of change point

  Autonomous Vehicles",2021-08-12T05:35:21Z,Seongjin Choi,"Originally, the decision and control of the lane change of the vehicle were
on the human driver. In previous studies, the decision-making of lane-changing
of the human drivers was mainly used to increase the individual's benefit.
However, the lane-changing behavior of these human drivers can sometimes have a
bad influence on the overall traffic flow. As technology for autonomous
vehicles develop, lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making
fall within the control category of autonomous vehicles. However, since many of
the current lane-changing decision algorithms of autonomous vehicles are based
on the human driver model, it is hard to know the potential traffic impact of
such lane change. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the decision-making
of lane change considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we study the lane
change control system considering the whole traffic flow. In this research, the
lane change control system predicts the future traffic situation through the
cell transition model, one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation
models, and determines the change probability of each lane that minimizes the
total time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system
then conveys the change probability to this vehicle. In the macroscopic
simulation result, the proposed control system reduced the overall travel time
delay. The proposed system is applied to microscopic traffic simulation, the
oversaturated freeway traffic flow algorithm (OFFA), to evaluate the potential
performance when it is applied to the actual traffic system. In the traffic
flow-density, the maximum traffic flow has been shown to be increased, and the
points in the congestion area have also been greatly reduced. Overall, the time

A large-scale study on human-cloned changes for automated program repair,2021-04-06T09:22:56Z,"Fernanda Madeiral, Thomas Durieux","Research in automatic program repair has shown that real bugs can be
automatically fixed. However, there are several challenges involved in such a
task that are not yet fully addressed. As an example, consider that a
test-suite-based repair tool performs a change in a program to fix a bug
spotted by a failing test case, but then the same or another test case fails.
This could mean that the change is a partial fix for the bug or that another
bug was manifested. However, the repair tool discards the change and possibly
performs other repair attempts. One might wonder if the applied change should
be also applied in other locations in the program so that the bug is fully
fixed. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the extent of bug fix
changes being cloned by developers within patches. Our goal is to investigate
the need of multi-location repair by using identical or similar changes in
identical or similar contexts. To do so, we analyzed 3,049 multi-hunk patches
from the ManySStuBs4J dataset, which is a large dataset of single statement bug
fix changes. We found out that 68% of the multi-hunk patches contain at least
one change clone group. Moreover, most of these patches (70%) are
strictly-cloned ones, which are patches fully composed of changes belonging to
one single change clone group. Finally, most of the strictly-cloned patches

matrices may occur due to the change in the environment and the user location.
Although several works have proposed efficient algorithms to estimate the
channel covariance matrices after any change occurs, how to detect such a
change accurately and quickly is still an open problem in the literature. In
this paper, we focus on channel covariance change detection between a
multi-antenna base station (BS) and a single-antenna user equipment (UE). To
provide theoretical performance limit, we first propose a genie-aided change
detector based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test assuming the channel
covariance matrix after change is known, and characterize the corresponding
missed detection and false alarm probabilities. Then, this paper considers the
practical case where the channel covariance matrix after change is unknown. The
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation technique is used to predict the covariance
matrix based on the received pilot signals over a certain number of coherence
blocks, building upon which the LLR-based change detector is employed.
Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can detect the change with low
error probability even when the number of channel samples is small such that
the estimation of the covariance matrix is not that accurate. This result
verifies the possibility to detect the channel covariance change both

  Change Captioning",2021-10-20T00:57:39Z,"Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Chenggang Yan, Shengxiang Gao, Zhengtao Yu","Change captioning is to use a natural language sentence to describe the
fine-grained disagreement between two similar images. Viewpoint change is the
most typical distractor in this task, because it changes the scale and location
of the objects and overwhelms the representation of real change. In this paper,
we propose a Relation-embedded Representation Reconstruction Network (R$^3$Net)
to explicitly distinguish the real change from the large amount of clutter and
irrelevant changes. Specifically, a relation-embedded module is first devised
to explore potential changed objects in the large amount of clutter. Then,
based on the semantic similarities of corresponding locations in the two
images, a representation reconstruction module (RRM) is designed to learn the
reconstruction representation and further model the difference representation.
Besides, we introduce a syntactic skeleton predictor (SSP) to enhance the
semantic interaction between change localization and caption generation.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art results on two public datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10328v1
Assessing the Exposure of Software Changes: The DiPiDi Approach,2021-04-01T19:04:01Z,"Mehran Meidani, Maxime Lamothe, Shane McIntosh","Context: Changing a software application with many build-time configuration
settings may introduce unexpected side-effects. For example, a change intended
to be specific to a platform (e.g., Windows) or product configuration (e.g.,
community editions) might impact other platforms or configurations. Moreover, a
change intended to apply to a set of platforms or configurations may be
unintentionally limited to a subset. Indeed, understanding the exposure of
source code changes is an important risk mitigation step in change-based
development approaches. Objective: In this experiment, we seek to evaluate
DiPiDi, a prototype implementation of our approach to assess the exposure of
source code changes by statically analyzing build specifications. We focus our
evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of developers when assessing the
exposure of source code changes. Method: We will measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of developers when performing five tasks in which they must identify
the deliverable(s) and conditions under which a change will propagate. We will
assign participants into three groups: without explicit tool support, supported
by existing impact analysis tools, and supported by DiPiDi.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00725v1
"Intercept Graph: An Interactive Radial Visualization for Comparison of

application domains, such as medical science, financial engineering, sociology,
biological science, etc. Slope graphs and grouped bar charts have been widely
used to show a ""before-and-after"" story of different data states and indicate
their changes. However, they visualize state changes as either slope or
difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative
comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an
increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a
novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state
changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting
and ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly
encodes the ""state change"". By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner
circular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and
magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual
clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We
conducted a case study through comparing Intercept Graph with slope graphs and
grouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of
Intercept Graph.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10893v1

  Learning Approach",2021-12-17T10:16:43Z,"Daofei Li, Ao Liu","To develop driving automation technologies for human, a human-centered
methodology should be adopted for ensured safety and satisfactory user

development, we carry out driver-in-the-loop experiments on a
6-Degree-of-Freedom driving simulator. Based on the analysis of the lane change
data by drivers of three specific styles,personalization indicators are
selected to describe the driver preferences in lane change decision. Then a
deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach is applied to design human-like
agents for automated lane change decision, with refined reward and loss
functions to capture the driver preferences.The trained RL agents and benchmark
agents are tested in a two-lane highway driving scenario, and by comparing the
agents with the specific drivers at the same initial states of lane change, the
statistics show that the proposed algorithm can guarantee higher consistency of
lane change decision preferences. The driver personalization indicators and the

flexibility and versatility, but maintaining JS code is tedious and
error-prone. In our research, we conducted an empirical study to characterize
the relationship between co-changed software entities (e.g., functions and

additional entity to edit given developers' code changes. Specifically, we
first crawled 14,747 commits in 10 open-source projects; for each commit, we
created one or more change dependency graphs (CDGs) to model the
referencer-referencee relationship between co-changed entities. Next, we
extracted the common subgraphs between CDGs to locate recurring co-change
patterns between entities. Finally, based on those patterns, we extracted code
features from co-changed entities and trained an ML model that recommends
entities-to-change given a program commit. According to our empirical
investigation, (1) three recurring patterns commonly exist in all projects; (2)
80%--90% of co-changed function pairs either invoke the same function(s),
access the same variable(s), or contain similar statement(s); (3) our ML-based

the corresponding consequences, as their decisions collectively shape
contemporary science. There are studies focusing on the overall performance of
individuals with different problem choosing strategies. Here we ask a slightly
different but relatively unexplored question: how is a scientist's change of
research agenda associated with her change of scientific performance. Using
publication records of over 14,000 authors in physics, we quantitatively
measure the extent of research direction change and the performance change of
individuals. We identify a strong positive correlation between the direction
change and impact change. Scientists with a larger direction change not only
are more likely to produce works with increased scientific impact compared to
their past ones, but also have a higher growth rate of scientific impact. On
the other hand, the direction change is not associated with productivity
change. Those who stay in familiar topics do not publish faster than those who
venture out and establish themselves in a new field. The gauge of research
direction in this work is uncorrelated with the diversity of research agenda

individual careers from a new point of view. Though the finding is inevitably

important role in urban planning and sustainability. Although change detection
techniques have been successfully developed for many years, these techniques

provide every user with flexible access to change information and help them
better understand land-cover changes, we introduce a novel task: change
detection-based visual question answering (CDVQA) on multi-temporal aerial

change enhancing module to multi-temporal feature encoding, aiming at
incorporating more change-related information. Finally, effects of different

self-supervise the training of our model. Given the rarity of these lesion
changes in the synthesised images, we train the model with the imbalance robust

periods for change detection. We combine this spatial context-based change
detection with ensembling over mutually exclusive neighborhoods and
transitioning from pixel to object-level changes with morphological operations.
SiROC achieves competitive performance for change detection with
medium-resolution Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planetscope imagery on four

Change in Hamiltonian General Relativity with Spinors,2021-10-28T16:21:56Z,J. Brian Pitts,"In Hamiltonian GR, change has seemed to be missing, defined only
asymptotically, or otherwise obscured at best. By construing change as
essential time dependence, can one find change locally in Hamiltonian GR with
spinors?
  This paper is motivated by tendencies in space-time philosophy to slight
fermionic/spinorial matter, in Hamiltonian GR to misplace changes of time
coordinate, and in treatments of the Einstein-Dirac equation to include a
gratuitous local Lorentz gauge symmetry. Spatial dependence is dropped in most
of the paper. To include all and only the coordinate freedom, the
Einstein-Dirac equation is investigated using the Schwinger time gauge and
Kibble-Deser symmetric triad condition as a $3+1$ version of the
DeWitt-Ogievetsky-Polubarinov nonlinear group realization formalism that
dispenses with a tetrad and local Lorentz gauge freedom. Change is the lack of
a time-like stronger-than-Killing field for which the Lie derivative of the
metric-spinor complex vanishes. An appropriate $3+1$-friendly form of the
Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator $G$, a tuned sum of
first class-constraints, changes the canonical Lagrangian by a total derivative

high-dimensional observations, beyond the first two moments. This has remained
a substantially less explored problem in the existing literature, especially in
the high-dimensional context, compared to detecting changes in the mean or the
covariance structure. We develop a nonparametric methodology to (i) detect an
unknown number of change-points in an independent sequence of high-dimensional
observations and (ii) test for the significance of the estimated change-point
locations. Our approach essentially rests upon nonparametric tests for the
homogeneity of two high-dimensional distributions. We construct a single
change-point location estimator via defining a cumulative sum process in an
embedded Hilbert space. As the key theoretical innovation, we rigorously derive
its limiting distribution under the high dimension medium sample size (HDMSS)
framework. Subsequently we combine our statistic with the idea of wild binary

Likelihood Scores for Sparse Signal and Change-Point Detection,2021-05-15T04:20:01Z,"Shouri Hu, Jingyan Huang, Hao Chen, Hock Peng Chan","We consider here the identification of change-points on large-scale data
streams. The objective is to find the most efficient way of combining
information across data stream so that detection is possible under the smallest
detectable change magnitude. The challenge comes from the sparsity of
change-points when only a small fraction of data streams undergo change at any
point in time. The most successful approach to the sparsity issue so far has
been the application of hard thresholding such that only local scores from data
streams exhibiting significant changes are considered and added. However the
identification of an optimal threshold is a difficult one. In particular it is
unlikely that the same threshold is optimal for different levels of sparsity.
We propose here a sparse likelihood score for identifying a sparse signal. The
score is a likelihood ratio for testing between the null hypothesis of no
change against an alternative hypothesis in which the change-points or signals
are barely detectable. By the Neyman-Pearson Lemma this score has maximum
detection power at the given alternative. The outcome is that we have a scoring
of data streams that is successful in detecting at the boundary of the
detectable region of signals and change-points. The likelihood score can be
seen as a soft thresholding approach to sparse signal and change-point
detection in which local scores that indicate small changes are down-weighted
much more than local scores indicating large changes. We are able to show
second-order optimality of the sparsity likelihood score in the sense of
achieving successful detection at the minimum detectable order of change
magnitude as well as at the minimum detection asymptotic constant with respect
this order of change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07137v2

scores that allows for (1) unequally-spaced study waves and (2) individual
measurement occasions around each wave. We also extend the existing model to
estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration (that largely
determines the trajectory shape and is viewed as the most important parameter
in the Jenss-Bayley model). We present the proposed model by a simulation study
and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation study demonstrates that the
proposed model can estimate the parameters unbiasedly and precisely and exhibit
target confidence interval coverage. The simulation study also shows that the
proposed model with the novel expression for the change scores outperforms the
existing model. An empirical example using longitudinal reading scores shows
that the model can estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration and
generate individual rate-of-change in practice. We also provide the
corresponding code for the proposed model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00290v3
Self-supervised Change Detection in Multi-view Remote Sensing Images,2021-03-10T09:56:09Z,"Yuxing Chen, Lorenzo Bruzzone","The vast amount of unlabeled multi-temporal and multi-sensor remote sensing
data acquired by the many Earth Observation satellites present a challenge for
change detection. Recently, many generative model-based methods have been
proposed for remote sensing image change detection on such unlabeled data.
However, the high diversities in the learned features weaken the discrimination
of the relevant change indicators in unsupervised change detection tasks.
Moreover, these methods lack research on massive archived images. In this work,
a self-supervised change detection approach based on an unlabeled multi-view
setting is proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by the use of
a multi-view contrastive loss and an implicit contrastive strategy in the
feature alignment between multi-view images. In this approach, a pseudo-Siamese
network is trained to regress the output between its two branches pre-trained
in a contrastive way on a large dataset of multi-temporal homogeneous or
heterogeneous image patches. Finally, the feature distance between the outputs
of the two branches is used to define a change measure, which can be analyzed
by thresholding to get the final binary change map. Experiments are carried out
on five homogeneous and heterogeneous remote sensing image datasets. The
proposed SSL approach is compared with other supervised and unsupervised
state-of-the-art change detection methods. Results demonstrate both
improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and that the proposed
SSL approach narrows the gap between unsupervised and supervised change
detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05969v1

progressive collapse performance of a building during a demolition event.
Multi-temporal oblique photogrammetry images are collected with 3D point clouds
generated at different stages of the demolition. The geometric accuracy of the
generated point clouds has been evaluated against both airborne and terrestrial
LiDAR point clouds, achieving an average distance of 12 cm and 16 cm for roof

framework that unifies multi-temporal UAV images for pose estimation (free of
ground control points), reconstruction, and a coarse-to-fine 3D density change
analysis. This work has provided a solution capable of addressing change
detection on full 3D time-series datasets where dramatic scene content changes
are presented progressively. Our change detection results on the building
demolition event have been evaluated against the manually marked ground-truth
changes and have achieved an F-1 score varying from 0.78 to 0.92, with
consistently high precision (0.92 - 0.99). Volumetric changes through the

"Using Trajectory Compression Rate to Predict Changes in Cybersickness in
  Virtual Reality Games",2021-08-21T16:26:04Z,"Diego Monteiro, Hai-Ning Liang, Xiaohang Tang, Pourang Irani","Identifying cybersickness in virtual reality (VR) applications such as games
in a fast, precise, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive way remains challenging.
Several factors can cause cybersickness, and their identification will help
find its origins and prevent or minimize it. One such factor is virtual
movement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in
different forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally
annotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often
preferable to save it in a compressed form. Compression allows redundant data
to be eliminated while still preserving changes in speed and direction. Since
changes in direction and velocity in VR can be associated with cybersickness,
changes in compression rate can likely indicate changes in cybersickness
levels. In this research, we explore whether quantifying changes in virtual
movement can be used to estimate variation in cybersickness levels of VR users.
We investigate the correlation between changes in the compression rate of
movement data in two VR games with changes in players' cybersickness levels
captured during gameplay. Our results show (1) a clear correlation between
changes in compression rate and cybersickness, and(2) that a machine learning
approach can be used to identify these changes. Finally, results from a second
experiment show that our approach is feasible for cybersickness inference in
games and other VR applications that involve movement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09538v1
Quickest Change Detection with Non-Stationary Post-Change Observations,2021-10-04T17:25:01Z,"Yuchen Liang, Alexander G. Tartakovsky, Venugopal V. Veeravalli","The problem of quickest detection of a change in the distribution of a
sequence of independent observations is considered. The pre-change observations
are assumed to be stationary with a known distribution, while the post-change
observations are allowed to be non-stationary with some possible parametric
uncertainty in their distribution. In particular, it is assumed that the
cumulative Kullback-Leibler divergence between the post-change and the
pre-change distributions grows in a certain manner with time after the
change-point. For the case where the post-change distributions are known, a
universal asymptotic lower bound on the delay is derived, as the false alarm
rate goes to zero. Furthermore, a window-limited Cumulative Sum (CuSum)
procedure is developed, and shown to achieve the lower bound asymptotically.
For the case where the post-change distributions have parametric uncertainty, a
window-limited (WL) generalized likelihood-ratio (GLR) CuSum procedure is
developed and is shown to achieve the universal lower bound asymptotically.
Extensions to the case with dependent observations are discussed. The analysis
is validated through numerical results on synthetic data. The use of the
WL-GLR-CuSum procedure in monitoring pandemics is also demonstrated.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01581v3
Cross-validation for change-point regression: pitfalls and solutions,2021-12-06T18:23:12Z,"Florian Pein, Rajen D. Shah","Cross-validation is the standard approach for tuning parameter selection in
many non-parametric regression problems. However its use is less common in
change-point regression, perhaps as its prediction error-based criterion may
appear to permit small spurious changes and hence be less well-suited to
estimation of the number and location of change-points. We show that in fact
the problems of cross-validation with squared error loss are more severe and
can lead to systematic under- or over-estimation of the number of
change-points, and highly suboptimal estimation of the mean function in simple
settings where changes are easily detectable. We propose two simple approaches
to remedy these issues, the first involving the use of absolute error rather
than squared error loss, and the second involving modifying the holdout sets
used. For the latter, we provide conditions that permit consistent estimation
of the number of change-points for a general change-point estimation procedure.
We show these conditions are satisfied for least squares estimation using new
results on its performance when supplied with the incorrect number of
change-points. Numerical experiments show that our new approaches are
competitive with common change-point methods using classical tuning parameter
choices when error distributions are well-specified, but can substantially
outperform these in misspecified models. An implementation of our methodology
is available in the R package crossvalidationCP on CRAN.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03220v3
"A change-point detection method for detecting and locating the abrupt
  changes in distributions of damage-sensitive features of SHM data, with
  application to structural condition assessment",2021-11-16T07:03:22Z,"Xinyi Lei, Zhicheng Chen, Hui Li, Shiyin Wei","Diagnosing the changes of structural behaviors using monitoring data is an
important objective of structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes in
structural behaviors are usually manifested as the feature changes in monitored
structural responses; thus, developing effective methods for automatically
detecting such changes is of considerable significance. Existing methods for
change detection in SHM are mainly used for scalar or vector data, thus
incapable of detecting the changes of the features represented by complex data,
e.g., the probability density functions (PDFs). Detecting the abrupt changes
occurred in the distributions (represented by PDFs) associated with the
damage-sensitive features extracted from SHM data are usually of crucial
interest for structural condition assessment; however, the SHM community still
lacks effective diagnostic tools for detecting such changes. In this study, a
change-point detection method is developed in the functional data-analytic
framework for PDF-valued sequence, and it is leveraged to diagnose the
distributional information break encountered in structural condition
assessment. A major challenge in PDF-valued data modeling or analysis is that
the PDFs are special functional data subjecting to nonlinear constraints. To
tackle this issue, the PDFs are embedded into the Bayes space, and the
associated change-point model is constructed by using the linear structure of
the Bayes space; then, a hypothesis testing procedure is presented for
distributional change-point detection based on the isomorphic mapping between
the Bayes space and a functional linear space. Comprehensive simulation studies
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as
demonstrate its superiority over the competing method. Finally, an application
to real SHM data illustrates its practical utility in structural condition
assessment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08260v2

information in the graphs, exhibiting substantial improvements in testing power
and localization accuracy in simulations. We derive the null limiting
distribution, provide accurate analytic approximations to control type I error,
and establish theoretical guarantees on the power consistency under contiguous

  convection zone",2021-06-15T19:26:21Z,Sarbani Basu,"While it has been relatively easy to determine solar-cycle related changes in
solar dynamics, determining changes in structure in the deeper layers of the
Sun has proved to be difficult. By using helioseismic data obtained over two
solar cycles, and sacrificing resolution in favour of lower uncertainties, we
show that there are significant changes in the solar convection zone, and
perhaps even below it. Using MDI data, we find a relative squared sound-speed
difference of $(2.56\pm 0.71)\times 10^{-5}$ at the convection-zone base
between the maximum of solar Cycle~23 and the minimum between Cycles~23 and 24.
The squared sound-speed difference for the maximum of Cycle~24 obtained with
HMI data is $(1.95\pm 0.69)\times 10^{-5}$. GONG data support these results. We
also find that the sound speed in the solar convection zone decreases compared
to the sound speed below it as the Sun becomes more active. We find evidence of
changes in the radial derivative of the sound-speed difference between the
solar minimum and other epochs at the base of the convection zone implying
possible small changes in the position of the convection-zone base, however,
the results are too noisy to make any definitive estimates of the change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08383v1
Change Detection for Geodatabase Updating,2021-06-27T18:35:10Z,Rongjun Qin,"The geodatabase (vectorized data) nowadays becomes a rather standard digital
city infrastructure; however, updating geodatabase efficiently and economically
remains a fundamental and practical issue in the geospatial industry. The cost
of building a geodatabase is extremely high and labor intensive, and very often
the maps we use have several months and even years of latency. One solution is
to develop more automated methods for (vectorized) geospatial data generation,
which has been proven a difficult task in the past decades. An alternative
solution is to first detect the differences between the new data and the
existing geospatial data, and then only update the area identified as changes.
The second approach is becoming more favored due to its high practicality and
flexibility. A highly relevant technique is change detection. This article aims
to provide an overview the state-of-the-art change detection methods in the

our study, we apply logistic regression models to 9 changes which occurred
between 15th and 18th century in the Polish language. The attested course of
the majority of these changes closely follow the expected values, which proves
that the language change might indeed resemble a nonlinear phase change
scenario. We also extend the original Piotrowski's approach by proposing
polynomial logistic regression for these cases which can hardly be described by
its standard version. Also, we propose to consider individual language change

How individuals change language,2021-04-20T19:02:49Z,"Richard A Blythe, William Croft","Languages emerge and change over time at the population level though

We introduce a very general mathematical model that encompasses a wide variety
of individual-level linguistic behaviours and provides statistical predictions
for the population-level changes that result from them. This model allows us to
compare the likelihood of empirically-attested changes in definite and
indefinite articles in multiple languages under different assumptions on the
way in which individuals learn and use language. We find that accounts of
language change that appeal primarily to errors in childhood language
acquisition are very weakly supported by the historical data, whereas those
that allow speakers to change incrementally across the lifespan are more

Persistence of Conley-Morse Graphs in Combinatorial Dynamical Systems,2021-07-05T16:12:59Z,"Tamal K. Dey, Marian Mrozek, Ryan Slechta","Multivector fields provide an avenue for studying continuous dynamical
systems in a combinatorial framework. There are currently two approaches in the

second captures changes in the Morse decomposition. However, such approaches
have limitations. The former approach only describes how the Conley index
changes across a selected isolated invariant set though the dynamics can be
much more complicated than the behavior of a single isolated invariant set.
Likewise, considering a Morse decomposition omits much information about the
individual Morse sets. In this paper, we propose a method to summarize changes
in combinatorial dynamical systems by capturing changes in the so-called
Conley-Morse graphs. A Conley-Morse graph contains information about both the
structure of a selected Morse decomposition and about the Conley index at each

individuals, which complicates the epidemic process and brings great challenges
for the understanding and control of the epidemic. In this work, we consider
three kinds of typical behavioral changes in epidemic process that is,
self-quarantine of infected individuals, self-protection of susceptible
individuals, and social distancing between them. We connect the behavioral
changes with individual's social attributes by the activity-driven network with
attractiveness. A mean-field theory is established to derive an analytical
estimate of epidemic threshold for SIS models with individual behavioral
changes, which depends on the correlations between activity, attractiveness and
the number of generative links in the susceptible and infected states. We find
that individual behaviors play different roles in suppressing the epidemic.
Although all the behavioral changes could delay the epidemic by increasing the
epidemic threshold, self-quarantine and social distancing of infected
individuals could effectively decrease the epidemic size. In addition,
simultaneous changes in these behaviors and the timing of implement of them
also play a key role in suppressing the epidemic. These results provide helpful
significance for understanding the interaction of individual behaviors in the
epidemic process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14143v1

Deep few-shot learning for bi-temporal building change detection,2021-08-25T14:38:21Z,"Mehdi Khoshboresh-Masouleh, Reza Shah-Hosseini","In real-world applications (e.g., change detection), annotating images is
very expensive. To build effective deep learning models in these applications,
deep few-shot learning methods have been developed and prove to be a robust
approach in small training data. The analysis of building change detection from
high spatial resolution remote sensing observations is important research in
photogrammetry, computer vision, and remote sensing nowadays, which can be
widely used in a variety of real-world applications, such as map updating. As
manual high resolution image interpretation is expensive and time-consuming,
building change detection methods are of high interest. The interest in
developing building change detection approaches from optical remote sensing
images is rapidly increasing due to larger coverages, and lower costs of
optical images. In this study, we focus on building change detection analysis
on a small set of building change from different regions that sit in several
cities. In this paper, a new deep few-shot learning method is proposed for
building change detection using Monte Carlo dropout and remote sensing
observations. The setup is based on a small dataset, including bitemporal
optical images labeled for building change detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11262v2
"A systematic search for changing-look quasars in SDSS-II using
  difference spectra",2021-04-29T09:21:52Z,"B. Potts, C. Villforth","""Changing-look quasars"" (CLQs) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) showing
extreme variability that results in a transition from Type 1 to Type 2. The
short timescales of these transitions present a challenge to the unified model
of AGN and the physical processes causing these transitions remain poorly
understood. CLQs also provide interesting samples for the study of AGN host
galaxies since the central emission disappears almost entirely. Previous
searches for CLQs have utilised photometric variability or SDSS classification
changes to systematically identify CLQs, this approach may miss lower
luminosity CLQs. In this paper, we aim to use spectroscopic data to asses if
analysis difference spectra can be used to detect further changing look quasars
missed by photometric searches. We search SDSS-II DR 7 repeat spectra for
sources that exhibit either a disappearance or appearance of both broad line
emission and accretion disk continuum emission by directly analysing the
difference spectrum between two epochs of observation. From a sample of 24,782
objects with difference spectra, our search yielded six CLQs within the
redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.3$, including four newly identified sources.
Spectral analysis indicates that changes in accretion rate can explain the
changing-look behaviour. While a change in dust extinction fits the changes in
spectral shape, the time-scales of the changes observed are too short for
obscuration from torus clouds. Using difference spectra was shown to be an
effective and sensitive way to detect CLQs. We recover CLQs an order of
magnitude lower in luminosities than those found by photometric searches and
achieve higher completeness than spectroscopic searches relying on pipeline
classification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14225v1

in the military and crisis-management domains. Recent methods used for change
detection have shifted towards deep learning, which depends on the quality of
its training data. The assembly of large-scale annotated satellite imagery
datasets is therefore essential for global building-change surveillance.
Existing datasets almost exclusively offer near-nadir viewing angles. This
limits the range of changes that can be detected. By offering larger
observation ranges, the scroll imaging mode of optical satellites presents an
opportunity to overcome this restriction. This paper therefore introduces
S2Looking, a building-change-detection dataset that contains large-scale
side-looking satellite images captured at various off-nadir angles. The dataset
consists of 5000 bitemporal image pairs of rural areas and more than 65,920
annotated instances of changes throughout the world. The dataset can be used to
train deep-learning-based change-detection algorithms. It expands upon existing
datasets by providing (1) larger viewing angles; (2) large illumination
variances; and (3) the added complexity of rural images. To facilitate {the}
use of the dataset, a benchmark task has been established, and preliminary
tests suggest that deep-learning algorithms find the dataset significantly more
challenging than the closest-competing near-nadir dataset, LEVIR-CD+. S2Looking

C18O line fluxes, and VLA 3 cm continuum fluxes taken contemporaneously over
one month. The X-ray to optical observations were presented previously. Here we
present the ALMA and VLA data and make comparisons to GM Aur's accretion and
X-ray properties. We report no variability in the observed millimeter CO
emission. Using disk chemistry models, we show that the magnitude of the
changes seen in the FUV luminosity of GM Aur could lead to variation of up to
~6% in CO line emission and changes in the X-ray luminosity could lead to
larger changes of ~25%. However, the FUV and X-ray luminosity increases must
last at least 100 years in order to induce changes, which seems implausible in
the TTS stage; also, these changes would be too small to be detectable by ALMA.
We report no variability in the 3 cm emission observed by the VLA, showing that
changes of less than a factor of ~3 in the accretion rates of TTSs do not lead
to detectable changes in the mass-loss rate traced by the jet at centimeter

  Module for Images with Different Resolutions",2021-02-27T11:17:40Z,"Mengxi Liu, Qian Shi, Andrea Marinoni, Da He, Xiaoping Liu, Liangpei Zhang","Change detection, which aims to distinguish surface changes based on
bi-temporal images, plays a vital role in ecological protection and urban
planning. Since high resolution (HR) images cannot be typically acquired
continuously over time, bi-temporal images with different resolutions are often
adopted for change detection in practical applications. Traditional
subpixel-based methods for change detection using images with different
resolutions may lead to substantial error accumulation when HR images are
employed; this is because of intraclass heterogeneity and interclass
similarity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel method for change
detection using images with different resolutions, that is more suitable for HR
images. To this end, we propose a super-resolution-based change detection
network (SRCDNet) with a stacked attention module. The SRCDNet employs a super
resolution (SR) module containing a generator and a discriminator to directly
learn SR images through adversarial learning and overcome the resolution
difference between bi-temporal images. To enhance the useful information in
multi-scale features, a stacked attention module consisting of five
convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) is integrated to the feature
extractor. The final change map is obtained through a metric learning-based
change decision module, wherein a distance map between bi-temporal features is
calculated. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method, which not only outperforms all baselines -with the highest F1
scores of 87.40% on the building change detection dataset and 92.94% on the
change detection dataset -but also obtains the best accuracies on experiments
performed with images having a 4x and 8x resolution difference. The source code

magnetic structure of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), with the
aim of answering the questions: How frequently do ICMEs undergo magnetic
complexity changes during propagation? What are the causes of such changes? Do
the in situ properties of ICMEs differ depending on whether they exhibit
complexity changes? We consider multi-spacecraft observations of 31 ICMEs by
MESSENGER, Venus Express, ACE, and STEREO between 2008 and 2014 while radially
aligned. By analyzing their magnetic properties at the inner and outer
spacecraft, we identify complexity changes which manifest as fundamental
alterations or significant re-orientations of the ICME. Plasma and suprathermal
electron data at 1 au, and simulations of the solar wind enable us to
reconstruct the propagation scenario for each event, and to identify critical
factors controlling their evolution. Results show that ~65% of ICMEs change
their complexity between Mercury and 1 au and that interaction with multiple
large-scale solar wind structures is the driver of these changes. Furthermore,
71% of ICMEs observed at large radial (>0.4 au) but small longitudinal (<15
degrees) separations exhibit complexity changes, indicating that propagation
over large distances strongly affects ICMEs. Results also suggest ICMEs may be
magnetically coherent over angular scales of at least 15 degrees, supporting
earlier theoretical and observational estimates. This work presents statistical
evidence that magnetic complexity changes are consequences of ICME interactions
with large-scale solar wind structures, rather than intrinsic to ICME
evolution, and that such changes are only partly identifiable from in situ
measurements at 1 au.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12637v1

previously-discovered changing-look quasars at two or more epochs. By comparing
these data with simulated results based on the behavior of X-ray binaries, we

further investigate the Eddington ratios of changing-look quasars before and

Self-Supervised Multisensor Change Detection,2021-02-12T12:31:10Z,"Sudipan Saha, Patrick Ebel, Xiao Xiang Zhu","Most change detection methods assume that pre-change and post-change images
are acquired by the same sensor. However, in many real-life scenarios, e.g.,
natural disaster, it is more practical to use the latest available images
before and after the occurrence of incidence, which may be acquired using
different sensors. In particular, we are interested in the combination of the
images acquired by optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. SAR
images appear vastly different from the optical images even when capturing the
same scene. Adding to this, change detection methods are often constrained to
use only target image-pair, no labeled data, and no additional unlabeled data.
Such constraints limit the scope of traditional supervised machine learning and
unsupervised generative approaches for multi-sensor change detection. Recent
rapid development of self-supervised learning methods has shown that some of
them can even work with only few images. Motivated by this, in this work we
propose a method for multi-sensor change detection using only the unlabeled

fact is that most services keep constant changes to timely adapt to changes of
external business/technical environment and changes of internal development
strategies. However, traditional services computing research does not consider
such changes sufficiently. Many works regard services as \textit{static}

Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV control framework

an asynchronous parallel computing (APC) structure which leads to a better

Lexical semantic change for Ancient Greek and Latin,2021-01-22T12:04:08Z,"Valerio Perrone, Simon Hengchen, Marco Palma, Alessandro Vatri, Jim Q. Smith, Barbara McGillivray","Change and its precondition, variation, are inherent in languages. Over time,
new words enter the lexicon, others become obsolete, and existing words acquire
new senses. Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a
central challenge in diachronic research. Historical corpora of classical
languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, typically come with rich metadata,
and existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual
information beyond the document timestamp. While embedding-based methods
feature among the current state of the art systems, they are lacking in the
interpretative power. In contrast, Bayesian models provide explicit and
interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. In this chapter we

an extension of the common Generalized Linear Model to infer both short- and
long-term changes in the coupling between a pre- and post-synaptic neuron based
on observed spiking activity. We model short-term synaptic plasticity using
additive effects that depend on the presynaptic spike timing, and we model
long-term changes in both synaptic weight and baseline firing rate using point
process adaptive smoothing. Using simulations, we first show that this model
can accurately recover time-varying synaptic weights 1) for both depressing and
facilitating synapses, 2) with a variety of long-term changes (including
realistic changes, such as due to STDP), 3) with a range of pre- and
post-synaptic firing rates, and 4) for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
We then apply our model to two experimentally recorded putative synaptic
connections. We find that simultaneously tracking fast changes in synaptic

spurious inferences for the others. Altogether, this model provides a flexible

"An Empirical Review of Deep Learning Frameworks for Change Detection:
  Model Design, Experimental Frameworks, Challenges and Research Needs",2021-05-04T07:42:40Z,"Murari Mandal, Santosh Kumar Vipparthi","Visual change detection, aiming at segmentation of video frames into
foreground and background regions, is one of the elementary tasks in computer
vision and video analytics. The applications of change detection include
anomaly detection, object tracking, traffic monitoring, human machine
interaction, behavior analysis, action recognition, and visual surveillance.
Some of the challenges in change detection include background fluctuations,
illumination variation, weather changes, intermittent object motion, shadow,
fast/slow object motion, camera motion, heterogeneous object shapes and
real-time processing. Traditionally, this problem has been solved using
hand-crafted features and background modelling techniques. In recent years,
deep learning frameworks have been successfully adopted for robust change
detection. This article aims to provide an empirical review of the
state-of-the-art deep learning methods for change detection. More specifically,
we present a detailed analysis of the technical characteristics of different
model designs and experimental frameworks. We provide model design based
categorization of the existing approaches, including the 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN,
ConvLSTM, multi-scale features, residual connections, autoencoders and GAN
based methods. Moreover, an empirical analysis of the evaluation settings
adopted by the existing deep learning methods is presented. To the best of our
knowledge, this is a first attempt to comparatively analyze the different
evaluation frameworks used in the existing deep change detection methods.
Finally, we point out the research needs, future directions and draw our own
conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01342v1
Self-supervised Remote Sensing Images Change Detection at Pixel-level,2021-05-18T13:28:46Z,"Yuxing Chen, Lorenzo Bruzzone","Deep learning techniques have achieved great success in remote sensing image
change detection. Most of them are supervised techniques, which usually require
large amounts of training data and are limited to a particular application.
Self-supervised methods as an unsupervised approach are popularly used to solve
this problem and are widely used in unsupervised binary change detection tasks.
However, the existing self-supervised methods in change detection are based on
pre-tasks or at patch-level, which may be sub-optimal for pixel-wise change
detection tasks. Therefore, in this work, a pixel-wise contrastive approach is
proposed to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by using contrastive
loss in pixel-level features on an unlabeled multi-view setting. In this
approach, a Siamese ResUnet is trained to obtain pixel-wise representations and
to align features from shifted positive pairs. Meanwhile, vector quantization
is used to augment the learned features in two branches. The final binary
change map is obtained by subtracting features of one branch from features of
the other branch and using the Rosin thresholding method. To overcome the
effects of regular seasonal changes in binary change maps, we also used an
uncertainty method to enhance the temporal robustness of the proposed approach.
Two homogeneous (OSCD and MUDS) datasets and one heterogeneous (California
Flood) dataset are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.
Results demonstrate improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over the
patch-wise multi-view contrastive method.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08501v2
Changes from the Trenches: Should We Automate Them?,2021-05-21T06:43:58Z,"Yaroslav Golubev, Jiawei Li, Viacheslav Bushev, Timofey Bryksin, Iftekhar Ahmed","Code changes constitute one of the most important features of software
evolution. Studying them can provide insights into the nature of software
development and also lead to practical solutions - recommendations and
automations of popular changes for developers.
  In our work, we developed a tool called PythonChangeMiner that allows to
discover code change patterns in the histories of Python projects. We validated
the tool and then employed it to discover patterns in the dataset of 120
projects from four different domains of software engineering. We manually
categorized patterns that occur in more than one project from the standpoint of
their structure and content, and compared different domains and patterns in
that regard. We conducted a survey of the authors of the discovered changes:
82.9% of them said that they can give the change a name and 57.9% expressed
their desire to have the changes automated, indicating the ability of the tool
to discover valuable patterns. Finally, we interviewed 9 members of a popular
integrated development environment (IDE) development team to estimate the
feasibility of automating the discovered changes. It was revealed that
independence from the context and high precision made a pattern a better
candidate for automation. The patterns received mainly positive reviews and
several were ranked as very likely for automation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10157v2
Adversarially robust change point detection,2021-05-21T15:37:04Z,"Mengchu Li, Yi Yu","Change point detection is becoming increasingly popular in many application
areas. On one hand, most of the theoretically-justified methods are
investigated in an ideal setting without model violations, or merely robust
against identical heavy-tailed noise distribution across time and/or against
isolate outliers; on the other hand, we are aware that there have been
exponentially growing attacks from adversaries, who may pose systematic
contamination on data to purposely create spurious change points or disguise
true change points. In light of the timely need for a change point detection
method that is robust against adversaries, we start with, arguably, the
simplest univariate mean change point detection problem. The adversarial
attacks are formulated through the Huber $\varepsilon$-contamination framework,
which in particular allows the contamination distributions to be different at
each time point. In this paper, we demonstrate a phase transition phenomenon in
change point detection. This detection boundary is a function of the
contamination proportion $\varepsilon$ and is the first time shown in the
literature. In addition, we derive the minimax-rate optimal localisation error
rate, quantifying the cost of accuracy in terms of the contamination
proportion. We propose a computationally feasible method, matching the minimax
lower bound under certain conditions, saving for logarithmic factors. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted with comparisons to robust change point

FCCDN: Feature Constraint Network for VHR Image Change Detection,2021-05-23T06:13:47Z,"Pan Chen, Danfeng Hong, Zhengchao Chen, Xuan Yang, Baipeng Li, Bing Zhang","Change detection is the process of identifying pixelwise differences in
bitemporal co-registered images. It is of great significance to Earth
observations. Recently, with the emergence of deep learning (DL), the power and
feasibility of deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been
shown in the field of change detection. However, there is still a lack of
effective supervision for change feature learning. In this work, a feature
constraint change detection network (FCCDN) is proposed. We constrain features
both in bitemporal feature extraction and feature fusion. More specifically, we
propose a dual encoder-decoder network backbone for the change detection task.
At the center of the backbone, we design a nonlocal feature pyramid network to
extract and fuse multiscale features. To fuse bitemporal features in a robust
way, we build a dense connection-based feature fusion module. Moreover, a
self-supervised learning-based strategy is proposed to constrain feature
learning. Based on FCCDN, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on two
building change detection datasets (LEVIR-CD and WHU). On the LEVIR-CD dataset,
we achieve an IoU of 0.8569 and an F1 score of 0.9229. On the WHU dataset, we
achieve an IoU of 0.8820 and an F1 score of 0.9373. Moreover, for the first

achieved without using semantic segmentation labels. This is vital for the
application of change detection because it saves the cost of labeling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10860v2

uncertainty. This uncertainty manifests itself in significant changes that tend

is important to understand the root causes of such changes since this allows us
to react to change or anticipate future changes. Research in process mining has
so far only focused on detecting, locating and characterizing significant
changes in a process and not on finding root causes of such changes. In this
paper, we aim to close this gap. We propose a framework that adds an
explainability level onto concept drift detection in process mining and
provides insights into the cause-effect relationships behind significant

in these perspectives and plug the perspectives into a causality check that

Change-point Detection for Piecewise Exponential Models,2021-12-07T19:43:52Z,"Philip Cooney, Arthur White","In decision modelling with time to event data, parametric models are often
used to extrapolate the survivor function. One such model is the piecewise
exponential model whereby the hazard function is partitioned into segments,
with the hazard constant within the segment and independent between segments
and the boundaries of these segments are known as change-points. We present an
approach for determining the location and number of change-points in piecewise
exponential models. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) where the model parameters can be integrated out of
the model and the number of change-points can be sampled as part of the MCMC
scheme. We can estimate both the uncertainty in the change-point locations and
hazards for a given change-point model and obtain a probabilistic
interpretation for the number of change-points. We evaluate model performance
to determine changepoint numbers and locations in a simulation study and show
the utility of the method using two data sets for time to event data. In a
dataset of Glioblastoma patients we use the piecewise exponential model to
describe the general trends in the hazard function. In a data set of heart
transplant patients, we show the piecewise exponential model produces the best
statistical fit and extrapolation amongst other standard parametric models.
Piecewise exponential models may be useful for survival extrapolation if a
long-term constant hazard trend is clinically plausible. A key advantage of
this method is that the number and change-point locations are automatically
estimated rather than specified by the analyst.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03962v1

to trace specific diachronic trajectories: `changed at a particular time period

and weaving areas further reduce roadway capacity. The emergence of deep
reinforcement learning (RL) and connected and automated vehicle technology
provides a possible solution to improve mobility and energy efficiency at
freeway bottlenecks through cooperative lane changing. Deep RL is a collection
of machine-learning methods that enables an agent to improve its performance by
learning from the environment. In this study, a decentralized cooperative
lane-changing controller was developed using proximal policy optimization by
adopting a multi-agent deep RL paradigm. In the decentralized control strategy,
policy learning and action reward are evaluated locally, with each agent
(vehicle) getting access to global state information. Multi-agent deep RL
requires lower computational resources and is more scalable than single-agent
deep RL, making it a powerful tool for time-sensitive applications such as
cooperative lane changing. The results of this study show that cooperative lane
changing enabled by multi-agent deep RL yields superior performance to human
drivers in term of traffic throughput, vehicle speed, number of stops per
vehicle, vehicle fuel efficiency, and emissions. The trained RL policy is
transferable and can be generalized to uncongested, moderately congested, and

changes in discretizations of a profile. These probabilities, which are usually
varying with the scale, can be reinterpreted as scale-dependent Hurst
exponents. For a large class of Gaussian stochastic processes change
probabilities are shown to be directly related to the classical Hurst exponent,

a very challenging problem, and this becomes even more challenging when the
sample size (i.e., the sequence length) is small. In this article, we propose
some change-point detection methods based on clustering, which can be
conveniently used in such high dimension, low sample size situations. First, we
consider the single change-point problem. Using k-means clustering based on
some suitable dissimilarity measures, we propose some methods for testing the
existence of a change-point and estimating its location. High-dimensional
behavior of these proposed methods are investigated under appropriate
regularity conditions. Next, we extend our methods for detection of multiple
change-points. We carry out extensive numerical studies to compare the
performance of our proposed methods with some state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14012v1

monitoring applications and remains a high priority for remote sensing science.
Data sparsity, subtle changes, seasonal trends, and the presence of outliers
make detecting actual landscape changes challenging. Adams and MacKay (2007)
introduced Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD), a computationally
efficient, exact Bayesian method for change detection. Incorporation of prior
information allows for relaxed dependence on dense data and an extensive stable
period, making this method applicable to relatively short time series and
multiple changepoint detection. In this paper we conduct BOCPD with a
multivariate linear regression framework that supports seasonal trends. We
introduce a mechanism to make BOCPD robust against occasional outliers without
compromising the computational efficiency of an exact posterior change
distribution nor the detection latency. We show via simulations that the method
effectively detects change in the presence of outliers. The method is then
applied to monitor deforestation in Myanmar where we show superior performance

"Does chronology matter in JIT defect prediction? A Partial Replication
  Study",2021-03-05T07:33:38Z,"Hadi Jahanshahi, Dhanya Jothimani, AyÅe BaÅar, Mucahit Cevik","Just-In-Time (JIT) models detect the fix-inducing changes (or defect-inducing
changes). These models are designed based on the assumption that past code
change properties are similar to future ones. However, as the system evolves,
the expertise of developers and/or the complexity of the system also changes.
  In this work, we aim to investigate the effect of code change properties on
JIT models over time. We also study the impact of using recent data as well as
all available data on the performance of JIT models. Further, we analyze the
effect of weighted sampling on the performance of fix-inducing properties of
JIT models. For this purpose, we used datasets from Eclipse JDT, Mozilla,
Eclipse Platform, and PostgreSQL.
  We used five families of change-code properties such as size, diffusion,
history, experience, and purpose. We used Random Forest to train and test the
JIT model and Brier Score and the area under the ROC curve for performance
measurement.
  Our paper suggests that the predictive power of JIT models does not change
over time. Furthermore, we observed that the chronology of data in JIT defect
prediction models can be discarded by considering all the available data. On
the other hand, the importance score of families of code change properties is
found to oscillate over time.
  To mitigate the impact of the evolution of code change properties, it is
recommended to use a weighted sampling approach in which more emphasis is
placed upon the changes occurring closer to the current time. Moreover, since
properties such as ""Expertise of the Developer"" and ""Size"" evolve with time,
the models obtained from old data may exhibit different characteristics
compared to those employing the newer dataset. Hence, practitioners should
constantly retrain JIT models to include fresh data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03506v1

  Rank-based Distribution-free Nonparametric Testing via Measure Transportation
  with Applications in Tumor Microarrays and Dementia",2021-08-12T21:53:46Z,Amanda Ng,"In this paper, I propose a general algorithm for multiple change point
analysis via multivariate distribution-free nonparametric testing based on the
concept of ranks that are defined by measure transportation. Multivariate ranks
and the usual one-dimensional ranks both share an important property: they are
both distribution-free. This finding allows for the creation of nonparametric
tests that are distribution-free under the null hypothesis. This method has
applications in a variety of fields, and in this paper I implement this
algorithm to a microarray dataset for individuals with bladder tumors, an ECoG
snapshot for a patient with epilepsy, and in the context of trajectories of
CASI scores by education level and dementia status. Each change point denotes a
shift in the rate of change of Cognitive Abilities score over years, indicating
the existence of preclinical dementia. Here I will estimate the number of
change points and each of their locations within a multivariate series of
time-ordered observations. This paper will examine the multiple change point
question in a broad setting in which the observed distributions and number of
change points are unspecified, rather than assume the time series observations
follow a parametric model or there is one change point, as many works in this
area assume. The objective here is to create an algorithm for change point
detection while making as few assumptions about the dataset as possible.
Presented are the theoretical properties of this new algorithm and the
conditions under which the approximate number of change points and their
locations can be estimated. This algorithm has also been successfully

this paper is dedicated to the execution of this procedure, as well as the use
of the recp package.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05979v3

characterised by a jump (non transitory change) or a bump (transitory change)
from constant. We propose a complete study from the nonasymptotic minimax
testing point of view, when the constant baseline intensity is known or
unknown. The question of minimax adaptation with respect to each parameter
(height, location, length) of the change is tackled, leading to a comprehensive
overview of the various minimax separation rate regimes. We exhibit three such
regimes and identify the factors of the two phase transitions, by giving the
cost of adaptation to each parameter. For each alternative hypothesis,
depending on the knowledge or not of each change parameter, we propose minimax
or minimax adaptive tests based on linear statistics, close to CUSUM
statistics, or quadratic statistics more adapted to the L 2-distance considered
in our minimax criteria and typically more powerful in practice, as our
simulation study shows. When the change location or length is unknown, our
adaptive tests are constructed from a scan aggregation principle combined with
Bonferroni or min-p level correction, and a conditioning trick when the

Online Continual Adaptation with Active Self-Training,2021-06-11T17:51:25Z,"Shiji Zhou, Han Zhao, Shanghang Zhang, Lianzhe Wang, Heng Chang, Zhi Wang, Wenwu Zhu","Models trained with offline data often suffer from continual distribution
shifts and expensive labeling in changing environments. This calls for a new
online learning paradigm where the learner can continually adapt to changing
environments with limited labels. In this paper, we propose a new online
setting -- Online Active Continual Adaptation, where the learner aims to
continually adapt to changing distributions using both unlabeled samples and
active queries of limited labels. To this end, we propose Online Self-Adaptive
Mirror Descent (OSAMD), which adopts an online teacher-student structure to
enable online self-training from unlabeled data, and a margin-based criterion
that decides whether to query the labels to track changing distributions.
Theoretically, we show that, in the separable case, OSAMD has an $O({T}^{2/3})$
dynamic regret bound under mild assumptions, which is aligned with the
$\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound of online learning algorithms with full labels.
In the general case, we show a regret bound of $O({T}^{2/3} + \alpha^* T)$,
where $\alpha^*$ denotes the separability of domains and is usually small. Our
theoretical results show that OSAMD can fast adapt to changing environments
with active queries. Empirically, we demonstrate that OSAMD achieves favorable
regrets under changing environments with limited labels on both simulated and
real-world data, which corroborates our theoretical findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06526v2
"Interactive Change Point Detection using optimisation approach and
  Bayesian statistics applied to real world applications",2021-06-17T17:46:05Z,"Rebecca Gedda, Larisa Beilina, Ruomu Tan","Change point detection becomes more and more important as datasets increase
in size, where unsupervised detection algorithms can help users process data.
To detect change points, a number of unsupervised algorithms have been
developed which are based on different principles. One approach is to define an
optimisation problem and minimise a cost function along with a penalty
function. In the optimisation approach, the choice of the cost function affects
the predictions made by the algorithm. In extension to the existing studies, a
new type of cost function using Tikhonov regularisation is introduced. Another
approach uses Bayesian statistics to calculate the posterior probability
distribution of a specific point being a change point. It uses a priori
knowledge on the distance between consecutive change points and a likelihood
function with information about the segments. The optimisation and Bayesian
approaches for offline change point detection are studied and applied to
simulated datasets as well as a real world multi-phase dataset. The approaches
have previously been studied separately and a novelty lies in comparing the
predictions made by the two approaches in a specific setting, consisting of

  instabilities",2021-10-25T14:51:57Z,"Marzena Sniegowska, Mikolaj Grzedzielski, Bozena Czerny, Agnieszka Janiuk","Apart from regular, low-level stochastic variability, some AGN occasionally
show exceptionally large changes in the luminosity, spectral shape, and/or
X-ray absorption. The most notable are the changes of the spectral type when
the source classified as a Seyfert 1 becomes a Seyfert 2 galaxy or vice versa.
Thus a name was coined of 'Changing-Look AGN' (CL AGN). The origin of this
phenomenon is still unknown, but for most of the sources, there are strong
arguments in favor of the intrinsic changes. Understanding the nature of such
rapid changes is a challenge to the models of black hole accretion flows since
the timescales of the changes are much shorter than the standard disk viscous
timescales. We aim to model the CL AGN phenomenon assuming that the underlying
mechanism is the time-dependent evolution of a black hole accretion disk
unstable due to the dominant radiation pressure. We use a 1-dimensional,
vertically integrated disk model, but we allow for the presence of the hot
coronal layer above the disk and the presence of the inner purely hot flow. We
focus on the variability timescales and amplitudes, which can be regulated by
the action of large-scale magnetic fields, the description of the disk-corona
coupling, and the presence of an inner optically thin flow, like
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). We compare model predictions for the

Optimal network online change point localisation,2021-01-14T07:24:39Z,"Yi Yu, Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla, Daren Wang, Alessandro Rinaldo","We study the problem of online network change point detection. In this
setting, a collection of independent Bernoulli networks is collected
sequentially, and the underlying distributions change when a change point
occurs. The goal is to detect the change point as quickly as possible, if it
exists, subject to a constraint on the number or probability of false alarms.
In this paper, on the detection delay, we establish a minimax lower bound and
two upper bounds based on NP-hard algorithms and polynomial-time algorithms,
i.e., \[ \mbox{detection delay} \begin{cases} \gtrsim \log(1/\alpha)
\frac{\max\{r^2/n, \, 1\}}{\kappa_0^2 n \rho},\\ \lesssim \log(\Delta/\alpha)

sparsity, rank sparsity and the overall Type-I error upper bound. All the model
parameters are allowed to vary as $\Delta$, the location of the change point,
diverges. The polynomial-time algorithms are novel procedures that we propose
in this paper, designed for quick detection under two different forms of Type-I
error control. The first is based on controlling the overall probability of a
false alarm when there are no change points, and the second is based on
specifying a lower bound on the expected time of the first false alarm.
Extensive experiments show that, under different scenarios and the

"The thermodynamic principle determining the interface temperature during
  phase change",2021-02-15T18:20:15Z,"Tom Y. Zhao, Neelesh A. Patankar","What is the interface temperature during phase transition (for instance, from
liquid to vapor)? This question remains fundamentally unresolved. In the
modeling of heat transfer problems with no phase change, the temperature and
heat flux continuity conditions lead to the interface temperature. However, in
problems with phase change, the heat flux condition is used to determine the
amount of mass changing phase. This makes the interface temperature
indeterminate unless an additional condition is imposed. A common approach in
the modeling of boiling is to assume that the interface attains the saturation
temperature according some measure of pressure at the interface. This
assumption is usually applied even under highly non-equilibrium scenarios where
significant temperature gradients and mass transport occur across the
interface. In this work, an ab-initio thermodynamic principle is introduced
based on the entropy production at the interface that fully specifies the
associated temperature under non-equilibrium scenarios. Physically, the
thermodynamic principle provides a theoretical limit on the space of possible
phase change rates that can occur by associating the mass flux with a
corresponding interfacial entropy production rate; a stronger statement is made
that a system with sufficient degrees of freedom selects the maximum entropy
production, giving the observed phase change rate and associated interface
properties. This entropic principle captures experimental and computational
values of the interface temperature that can deviate by over $50\%$ from the
assumed saturation values. It also accounts for temperature jumps
(discontinuities) at the interface whose difference can exceed 15 degrees
Celcius. This thermodynamic principle is found to appropriately complete the
phase change problem.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08825v1

tractable and fully frequentist framework to characterize and implement
regression trees while also allowing a multivariate (potentially high
dimensional) response. The connection to regression trees is made by a high
dimensional model with dynamic mean vectors over multi-dimensional change axes.
Our theoretical analysis is carried out under a single two dimensional change
point setting. An optimal rate of convergence of the proposed estimator is
obtained, which in turn allows existence of limiting distributions.
Distributional behavior of change point estimates are split into two distinct
regimes, the limiting distributions under each regime is then characterized, in
turn allowing construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals for
$2d$-location of change. All results are obtained under a high dimensional
scaling $s\log^2 p=o(T_wT_h),$ where $p$ is the response dimension, $s$ is a
sparsity parameter, and $T_w,T_h$ are sampling periods along change axes. We
characterize full regression trees by defining a multiple multi-dimensional
change point model. Natural extensions of the single $2d$-change point

  tailed errors in finite and growing dimensions",2021-05-25T00:52:45Z,"Debarghya Mukherjee, Moulinath Banerjee, Ya'acov Ritov","This paper presents a number of new findings about the canonical change point
estimation problem. The first part studies the estimation of a change point on
the real line in a simple stump model using the robust Huber estimating
function which interpolates between the $\ell_1$ (absolute deviation) and
$\ell_2$ (least squares) based criteria. While the $\ell_2$ criterion has been
studied extensively, its robust counterparts and in particular, the $\ell_1$
minimization problem have not. We derive the limit distribution of the
estimated change point under the Huber estimating function and compare it to
that under the $\ell_2$ criterion. Theoretical and empirical studies indicate
that it is more profitable to use the Huber estimating function (and in
particular, the $\ell_1$ criterion) under heavy tailed errors as it leads to
smaller asymptotic confidence intervals at the usual levels compared to the
$\ell_2$ criterion. We also compare the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ approaches in a
parallel setting, where one has $m$ independent single change point problems
and the goal is to control the maximal deviation of the estimated change points
from the true values, and establish rigorously that the $\ell_1$ estimation
criterion provides a superior rate of convergence to the $\ell_2$, and that
this relative advantage is driven by the heaviness of the tail of the error
distribution. Finally, we derive minimax optimal rates for the change plane
estimation problem in growing dimensions and demonstrate that Huber estimation
attains the optimal rate while the $\ell_2$ scheme produces a rate sub-optimal
estimator for heavy tailed errors. In the process of deriving our results, we
establish a number of properties about the minimizers of compound Binomial and
compound Poisson processes which are of independent interest.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11591v1

topic that aims at retrieving pedestrians whose clothes are changed. This task
is quite challenging and has not been fully studied to date. Current works
mainly focus on body shape or contour sketch, but they are not robust enough
due to view and posture variations. The key to this task is to exploit
cloth-irrelevant cues. This paper proposes a semantic-guided pixel sampling
approach for the cloth-changing person re-ID task. We do not explicitly define
which feature to extract but force the model to automatically learn
cloth-irrelevant cues. Specifically, we first recognize the pedestrian's upper
clothes and pants, then randomly change them by sampling pixels from other
pedestrians. The changed samples retain the identity labels but exchange the
pixels of clothes or pants among different pedestrians. Besides, we adopt a
loss function to constrain the learned features to keep consistent before and
after changes. In this way, the model is forced to learn cues that are
irrelevant to upper clothes and pants. We conduct extensive experiments on the

architectural formulations are paramount for developing and deploying a system.
Untangling architectural changes, recovering semantic design, and producing
design notes are the crucial tasks of the design review process. To support
these tasks, we construct a lightweight tool [4] that can detect and decompose
semantic slices of a commit containing architectural instances. A semantic
slice consists of a description of relational information of involved modules,
their classes, methods and connected modules in a change instance, which is
easy to understand to a reviewer. We extract various directory and naming

Utilizing the DANS properties, our tool first detects architectural change

string processing). Our preliminary investigation with ten open-source projects

Change of human mobility during COVID-19: A United States case study,2021-09-18T22:09:39Z,"Justin Elarde, Joon-Seok Kim, Hamdi Kavak, Andreas ZÃ¼fle, Taylor Anderson","With the onset of COVID-19 and the resulting shelter in place guidelines

dramatically impacted. Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in
specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and
relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we
study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility
footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the delta Time Spent in Public Places
(Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US
county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
reduce the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent
components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find
counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and
global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation
analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior
correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county
as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of
the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change
in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three
latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in
mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. We observe significant
correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various
population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19
cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a
comprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09022v1

algorithm described in Haghi et al. (2015). The adopted axisymmetric
three-component model potential of the Galaxy includes a spherical bulge, a
flat Miyamoto--Nagai disk, and a spherical Navarro--Frenk--White dark matter
halo.The orbits are integrated backward in time. We compare the orbital
parameters of globular clusters derived in static and evolving potentials when
integrating the orbits for 5 and 12 Gyr backward. For the first time we have
studied the influence of separately a change in the masses and a change in the
sizes of the Galactic components. The changes in the masses and sizes of the
components are shown to act on the orbital parameters in the opposite way. At
small Galactocentric distances this influence is maximally compensated for. The
orbits of distant globular clusters and those with a large apocenter distance
undergo the biggest changes. We show that on time scales up to $-5$~Gyr the
orbits of globular clusters in the case of a potential with both changing
masses and changing sizes of the components undergo, on average, minor changes
compared to the case of a static potential. These changes fit into the limits
of the statistical uncertainties caused by the errors in the data. So, on these
time scales the Galactic potential may be deemed static. We provide tables with

problem for an online sequence of data. We use theoretical tools from optimal
detection theory to motivate a definition of online privacy based on the
average amount of information per observation of the stochastic system in
consideration. Two cases are considered: the full-information case, where the
eavesdropper measures all but the signals that indicate a change, and the
limited-information case, where the eavesdropper only measures the state of the
Markov process. For both cases, we provide ways to derive privacy upper-bounds

extensive corpus of tweets (produced between 20th March and 1st July 2020)
first we show how the topics associated with the development of the pandemic
changed through time, using topic modeling. Second, we show how the sentiment
polarity of the language used in the tweets changed from a relatively positive
valence during the first lockdown, toward a more negative valence in
correspondence with the reopening. Third we show how the average subjectivity
of the tweets increased linearly and fourth, how the popular and frequently

Epidemic change-point detection in general integer-valued time series,2021-03-24T16:46:19Z,"Mamadou Lamine Diop, William Kengne","In this paper, we consider the structural change in a class of discrete
valued time series, which the true conditional distribution of the observations
is assumed to be unknown.
  The conditional mean of the process depends on a parameter $\theta^*$ which
may change over time.
  We provide sufficient conditions for the consistency and the asymptotic
normality of the Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the
model.
  We consider an epidemic change-point detection and propose a test statistic
based on the QMLE of the parameter. Under the null hypothesis of a constant
parameter (no change), the test statistic converges to a distribution obtained
from a difference of two Brownian bridge. The test statistic diverges to
infinity under the epidemic alternative, which establishes that the proposed
procedure is consistent in power. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure
is illustrated by simulated and real data examples.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13336v2
City-scale Scene Change Detection using Point Clouds,2021-03-26T08:04:13Z,"Zi Jian Yew, Gim Hee Lee","We propose a method for detecting structural changes in a city using images

We first generate 3D point clouds for each traversal from the images and
approximate GNSS/INS readings using Structure-from-Motion (SfM). A direct
comparison of the two point clouds for change detection is not ideal due to
inaccurate geo-location information and possible drifts in the SfM. To
circumvent this problem, we propose a deep learning-based non-rigid
registration on the point clouds which allows us to compare the point clouds
for structural change detection in the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a dual
thresholding check and post-processing step to enhance the robustness of our
method. We collect two datasets for the evaluation of our approach. Experiments
show that our method is able to detect scene changes effectively, even in the
presence of viewpoint and illumination differences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14314v1
Long-term and multi-wavelength evolution of a changing-look AGN Mrk 1018,2021-06-06T08:17:04Z,"Bing Lyu, Zhen Yan, Wenfei Yu, Qingwen Wu","The physical mechanism for triggering the changing-look phenomenon in active

multi-wavelength spectral and flux variations for a changing-look AGN Mrk~1018
with long-term observations in the X-ray, optical/ultraviolet(UV), and radio
bands. Both the optical and the X-ray emission experience rapid decay in
changing-look phase during 2010--2015, where a re-flare appears in the
optical/UV and X-ray bands. We find a time lag of $\sim 20 $ days of optical/UV
behind X-ray variations in type 1.9 phase. The 5 GHz radio flux decreases by
$\sim 20$\% in type 1.9 phase during 2016--2017. We find both X-ray photon
index ($\Gamma$) and the optical-to-X-ray spectral index (\alphaox\,) are
anti-correlated with the Eddington scaled 2--10~keV X-ray luminosity
($L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{Edd}$) in the type 1.9 phase. However, the type 1
phase deviates from these two anti-correlations, which suggests that the change
of broad emission lines might be regulated by the evolution of accretion disk
(e.g., disappearing of the inner cold disk in the type 1.9 phase).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03059v2
Ultra High Dimensional Change Point Detection,2021-06-09T07:50:23Z,"Xin Liu, Liwen Zhang, Zhen Zhang","Structural breaks have been commonly seen in applications. Specifically for
detection of change points in time, research gap still remains on the setting

In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to detect change points in ultra
high dimension, by firstly proposing the dynamic titled current correlation
screening method to reduce the input dimension, and then detecting possible
change points in the framework of group variable selection. Not only the
spurious correlation between ultra-high dimensional covariates is taken into

of domains whose topology is not the same; a problem that is routinely ignored,
potentially introducing bias in downstream analysis. As a first step towards
solving such alignment problems, we propose an unsupervised algorithm for the
detection of changes in image topology. The model is based on a conditional
variational auto-encoder and detects topological changes between two images
during the registration step. We account for both topological changes in the

Communication in Complex Networks,2021-06-23T08:01:02Z,"Omar De la Cruz Cabrera, Jiafeng Jin, Silvia Noschese, Lothar Reichel","One of the properties of interest in the analysis of networks is \emph{global
communicability}, i.e., how easy or difficult it is, generally, to reach nodes
from other nodes by following edges. Different global communicability measures
provide quantitative assessments of this property, emphasizing different
aspects of the problem.
  This paper investigates the sensitivity of global measures of communicability
to local changes. In particular, for directed, weighted networks, we study how
different global measures of communicability change when the weight of a single
edge is changed; or, in the unweighted case, when an edge is added or removed.
The measures we study include the \emph{total network communicability}, based
on the matrix exponential of the adjacency matrix, and the \emph{Perron network
communicability}, defined in terms of the Perron root of the adjacency matrix
and the associated left and right eigenvectors.
  Finding what local changes lead to the largest changes in global
communicability has many potential applications, including assessing the
resilience of a system to failure or attack, guidance for incremental system
improvements, and studying the sensitivity of global communicability measures
to errors in the network connection data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12215v2

verify the safety and robustness of neural networks in real-world applications.
Existing methods are designed to verify the network before deployment, which

dynamically changing specifications and networks. To effectively handle such
problems, verification needs to be performed online when these changes take

these changes to accelerate the verification process. This paper establishes a
novel framework for scalable online verification to solve real-world
verification problems with dynamically changing specifications and/or networks.
We propose three types of acceleration algorithms: Branch Management to reduce

Incremental Computation to reuse previous results. Experiment results show that

propose the problem of detecting CH accounts, and then design an effective
detection algorithm which exploits changes in content and writing styles of
individual accounts, and a proposed novel feature selection method that works
at a fine-grained level within each individual account. The proposed method not

strategy that can identify the best transmission rate quickly and adaptively in
quasi-static channels. This problem can be cast into the stochastic bandit
framework, and the unawareness of time-stamps where channel changes
necessitates running change-point detection simultaneously with stochastic
bandit algorithms to improve adaptivity. We present a joint channel
change-point detection and link rate selection algorithm based on Thompson
Sampling (CD-TS) and show it can achieve a sublinear regret with respect to the
number of time steps $T$ when the channel coherence time is larger than a

correctly respond to data distribution changes. The phenomenon of changes in
data distributions is called concept drift, and it may harm the quality of the

that the used algorithms must be ready for the continuous adaptation of the
model to the changing data distributions. This work focuses on non-stationary
data stream classification, where a classifier ensemble is used. To keep the
ensemble model up to date, the new base classifiers are trained on the incoming
data blocks and added to the ensemble while, at the same time, outdated models
are removed from the ensemble. One of the problems with this type of model is
the fast reaction to changes in data distributions. We propose a new Chunk
Adaptive Restoration framework that can be adapted to any block-based data
stream classification algorithm. The proposed algorithm adjusts the data chunk

$A_{He}$ data obtained from the first Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system,
we show that $A_{He}$ variations are distinctively different in solar cycle 24

is significantly higher in slow/intermediate solar winds in cycle 24 as opposed
to the dominance of the typical $A_{He}$ = 4-5% events in the previous three
cycles. Further, the occurrence of $A_{He}$ $\geq$ 10% events is significantly
reduced in cycle 24. Not only that, the changes in delay of $A_{He}$ with
respect to peak sunspot numbers are less sensitive to changes in solar wind

"Contrastive latent variable modeling with application to case-control
  sequencing experiments",2021-02-12T19:26:03Z,"Andrew Jones, F. William Townes, Didong Li, Barbara E. Engelhardt","High-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies are powerful tools for
understanding cellular state. Often it is of interest to quantify and summarize
changes in cell state that occur between experimental or biological conditions.
Differential expression is typically assessed using univariate tests to measure
gene-wise shifts in expression. However, these methods largely ignore changes
in transcriptional correlation. Furthermore, there is a need to identify the
low-dimensional structure of the gene expression shift to identify collections
of genes that change between conditions. Here, we propose contrastive latent
variable models designed for count data to create a richer portrait of
differential expression in sequencing data. These models disentangle the
sources of transcriptional variation in different conditions, in the context of
an explicit model of variation at baseline. Moreover, we develop a model-based
hypothesis testing framework that can test for global and gene subset-specific
changes in expression. We test our model through extensive simulations and
analyses with count-based gene expression data from perturbation and
observational sequencing experiments. We find that our methods can effectively
summarize and quantify complex transcriptional changes in case-control
experimental sequencing data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06731v1
"Using a Cognitive Network Model of Moral and Social Beliefs to Explain
  Belief Change",2021-02-22T03:29:35Z,"Jonas Dalege, Tamara van der Does","Scepticism towards childhood vaccines and genetically modified food has grown
despite scientific evidence of their safety. Beliefs about scientific issues
are difficult to change because they are entrenched within many related moral
concerns and beliefs about what others think. We propose a cognitive network
model which estimates the relationships, dissonance, and randomness between all
related beliefs to derive predictions of the circumstances under which beliefs
change. Using a probabilistic nationally representative longitudinal study, we
found support for our model's predictions: Randomness of the belief networks
decreased over time, for many participants their estimated dissonance related
positively to their self-reported dissonance, and individuals who had high
estimated dissonance of their belief network were more likely to change their
beliefs to reduce this dissonance. This study is the first to combine a
unifying predictive model with an experimental intervention and sheds light on
dynamics of dissonance reduction leading to belief change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10751v3
"Change Matters: Medication Change Prediction with Recurrent Residual
  Networks",2021-05-05T05:51:30Z,"Chaoqi Yang, Cao Xiao, Lucas Glass, Jimeng Sun","Deep learning is revolutionizing predictive healthcare, including
recommending medications to patients with complex health conditions. Existing
approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which
often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically
relevant task is to identify medication changes.
  In this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual network, named MICRON, for
medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health
records as input and learns to update a hidden medication vector and the
medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector
is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications.
Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for
prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential
updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent
visit) more efficiently.
  We evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON
achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1
score, respectively. MICRON also requires fewer parameters, which significantly
reduces the training time to 38.3s per epoch with 1.5x speed-up.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01876v1
"Stress-Energy in the Conical Vacuum and its Implications for Topology
  Change",2021-05-07T19:42:25Z,Eric B. Jones,"This dissertation presents a semiclassical analysis of conical topology
change in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions wherein, to lowest order, the ambient
spacetime is classical and fixed while the scalar field coupled to it is
quantized. The vacuum expectation value of the scalar field stress-energy
tensor is calculated via two different approaches. The first of these involves
the explicit determination of the so called Sorkin-Johnston state on the cone
and an original regularization scheme, while the latter employs the conformal
vacuum and the more conventional point-splitting renormalization. It is found
that conical topology change seems not to suffer from the same pathologies that
trousers-type topology change does. This provides tentative agreement with
conjectures due to Sorkin and Borde, which attempt to classify topology
changing spacetimes with respect to their Morse critical points and in
particular, that the cone and yarmulke in $1+1$ dimensions lack critical points
of unit Morse index.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03477v1
Collective anomaly detection in High-dimensional VAR Models,2021-05-16T22:53:52Z,"Hyeyoung Maeng, Idris Eckley, Paul Fearnhead","There is increasing interest in detecting collective anomalies: potentially
short periods of time where the features of data change before reverting back
to normal behaviour. We propose a new method for detecting a collective anomaly
in VAR models. Our focus is on situations where the change in the VAR
coefficient matrix at an anomaly is sparse, i.e. a small number of entries of
the VAR coefficient matrix change. To tackle this problem, we propose a test
statistic for a local segment that is built on the lasso estimator of the
change in model parameters. This enables us to detect a sparse change more
efficiently and our lasso-based approach becomes especially advantageous when
the anomalous interval is short. We show that the new procedure controls Type 1
error and has asymptotic power tending to one. The practicality of our approach
is demonstrated through simulations and two data examples, involving New York
taxi trip data and EEG data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07538v1

historical data analysis. We propose a methodology to examine if long-term
changes in temperature increases and decreases across time exist (and to what
extent) at the local level for a given set of temperature readings at various
locations. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian change point model for
spatio-temporally dependent data where we select the number of change points at
each location using a ""forwards"" selection process using deviance information
criteria (DIC). We then fit the selected model and examine the linear slopes
across time to quantify changes in long-term temperature behavior. We show the

Multifractal test for nonlinear changes in time series,2021-05-26T17:41:12Z,"Damian G. Kelty-Stephen, Elizabeth Lane, Madhur Mangalam","The creativity and emergence of biological and psychological behavior are
nonlinear. However, that does not necessarily mean only that the measurements
of the behaviors are curvilinear. Furthermore, the linear model might fail to
reduce these measurements to a sum of independent random factors, implying
nonlinear changes over time. The present work reviews some of the concepts
implicated in linear changes over time and details the mathematical steps
involved. It introduces multifractality as a mathematical framework helpful in
determining whether and to what degree the measured time series exhibits
nonlinear changes over time. The mathematical steps include multifractal
analysis and surrogate data production for resolving when multifractality
entails nonlinear changes over time. Ultimately, when measurements fail to fit
the structures of the traditional linear model, multifractal modeling gives us
the means to make those nonlinear excursions explicit and perhaps permit the
development of theory that draws on both linear and nonlinear processes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13113v1

It is observed that the GFSP is a Skellam type version of the generalized

Automatic Y-axis Rescaling in Dynamic Visualizations,2021-09-20T15:20:51Z,"Jacob Fisher, Remco Chang, Eugene Wu","Animated and interactive data visualizations dynamically change the data
rendered in a visualization (e.g., bar chart). As the data changes, the y-axis

disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is
considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a
lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic
visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed
global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional
visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy. They
instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis
task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments

and connected infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can instantly
compromise the safety of the vehicle itself and other connected vehicles and
roadway infrastructure. One such cyberattack is the false information attack,
where an external attacker injects inaccurate information into the connected
vehicles and eventually can cause catastrophic consequences by compromising
safety-critical applications like the forward collision warning. The occurrence
and target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and
near-real-time detection challenging. Change point models, can be used for
real-time anomaly detection caused by the false information attack. In this

Expectation Maximization, Cumulative Summation, and Bayesian Online Change
Point Algorithms for cyberattack detection in the CV data. Also, data-driven
artificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be used to detect known and
unknown underlying patterns in the dataset, have the potential of detecting a

information attacks and compared the performance for detecting the attacks with
our developed change point models. Our study shows that change points models

"A Driven Disordered Systems Approach to Biological Evolution in Changing
  Environments",2021-08-13T11:19:14Z,"Suman G Das, Joachim Krug, Muhittin Mungan","Biological evolution of a population is governed by the fitness landscape,
which is a map from genotype to fitness. However, a fitness landscape depends
on the organisms environment, and evolution in changing environments is still
poorly understood. We study a particular model of antibiotic resistance
evolution in bacteria where the antibiotic concentration is an environmental
parameter and the fitness landscapes incorporate tradeoffs between adaptation
to low and high antibiotic concentration. With evolutionary dynamics that
follow fitness gradients, the evolution of the system under slowly changing
antibiotic concentration resembles the athermal dynamics of disordered physical
systems under external drives. Exploiting this resemblance, we show that our
model can be described as a system with interacting hysteretic elements. As in
the case of the driven disordered systems, adaptive evolution under antibiotic
concentration cycling is found to exhibit hysteresis loops and memory
formation. We derive a number of analytical results for quasistatic
concentration changes. We also perform numerical simulations to study how these
effects are modified under driving protocols in which the concentration is
changed in discrete steps. Our approach provides a general framework for
studying motifs of evolutionary dynamics in biological systems in a changing

Graph-Based Machine Learning Improves Just-in-Time Defect Prediction,2021-10-11T16:00:02Z,"Jonathan Bryan, Pablo Moriano","The increasing complexity of today's software requires the contribution of
thousands of developers. This complex collaboration structure makes developers
more likely to introduce defect-prone changes that lead to software faults.
Determining when these defect-prone changes are introduced has proven
challenging, and using traditional machine learning (ML) methods to make these
determinations seems to have reached a plateau. In this work, we build
contribution graphs consisting of developers and source files to capture the
nuanced complexity of changes required to build software. By leveraging these
contribution graphs, our research shows the potential of using graph-based ML
to improve Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction. We hypothesize that features
extracted from the contribution graphs may be better predictors of defect-prone
changes than intrinsic features derived from software characteristics. We
corroborate our hypothesis using graph-based ML for classifying edges that
represent defect-prone changes. This new framing of the JIT defect prediction
problem leads to remarkably better results. We test our approach on 14
open-source projects and show that our best model can predict whether or not a
code change will lead to a defect with an F1 score as high as 77.55% and a
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as high as 53.16%. This represents a
152% higher F1 score and a 3% higher MCC over the state-of-the-art JIT defect
prediction. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can

Modelling Behaviour Change using Cognitive Agent Simulations,2021-10-16T19:19:08Z,Catriona M. Kennedy,"In health psychology, Behaviour Change Theories(BCTs) play an important role
in modelling human goal achievement in adverse environments. Some of these

existing AI research in cognitive architecture. This paper presents
work-in-progress research to apply selected behaviour change theories to

theories are selected as examples (CEOS and PRIME). The research is focusing on
complex agent architectures required for self-determined goal achievement in
adverse circumstances where the action is difficult to maintain (e.g. healthy
eating at office parties). Such simulations are useful because they can provide
new insights into human behaviour change and improve conceptual precision. In

Typed Image-based Programming with Structure Editing,2021-10-18T03:11:15Z,"Jonathan Edwards, Tomas Petricek","Many beloved programming systems are image-based: self-contained worlds that
persist both code and data in a single file. Examples include Smalltalk, LISP,
HyperCard, Flash, and spreadsheets. Image-based programming avoids much of the
complexity of modern programming technology stacks and encourages more casual
and exploratory programming. However conventional file-based programming has
better support for collaboration and deployment. These problems have been
blamed for the limited commercial success of Smalltalk. We propose to enable
collaboration in image-based programming via types and structure editing.
  We focus on the problem of schema change on persistent data. We turn to
static types, which paradoxically require more schema change but also provide a
mechanism to express and execute those changes. To determine those changes we
turn to structure editing, so that we can capture changes in type definitions
with sufficient fidelity to automatically adapt the data to suit. We conjecture
that typical schema changes can be handled through structure editing of static
types.
  That positions us to tackle collaboration with what could be called version
control for structure editing. We present a theory realizing this idea, which
is our main technical contribution. While we focus here on editing types, if we
can extend the approach to cover the entire programming experience then it
would offer a new way to collaborate in image-based programming.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08993v1

foundational to development and rising standards of living. Our understanding
of this process has been propelled recently by two branches of work in the

how the complexity of an economy is expressed in the makeup of its output.
However, the connection between these branches is not well understood, nor how
they relate to a classic understanding of structural transformation. Here, we
present a simple dynamical modeling framework that unifies these areas of work,
based on the widespread observation that economies diversify preferentially
into activities that are related to ones they do already. We show how stylized
facts of long-run structural change, as well as complexity metrics, can both
emerge naturally from this one observation. However, complexity metrics take on
new meanings, as descriptions of the long-term changes an economy experiences
rather than measures of complexity per se. This suggests relatedness and
complexity metrics are connected, in a hitherto overlooked way: Both describe
structural change, on different time scales. Whereas relatedness probes
transformation on short time scales, complexity metrics capture long-term
change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09673v2

  Advertising Auctions",2021-10-20T05:06:03Z,"Shumpei Goke, Gabriel Y. Weintraub, Ralph Mastromonaco, Sam Seljan","We study actual bidding behavior when a new auction format gets introduced
into the marketplace. More specifically, we investigate this question using a
novel dataset on internet display advertising auctions that exploits a
staggered adoption by different publishers (sellers) of first-price auctions
(FPAs), instead of the traditional second-price auctions (SPAs). Event study
regression estimates indicate that, immediately after the auction format
change, the revenue per sold impression (price) jumped considerably for the
treated publishers relative to the control publishers, ranging from 35% to 75%
of the pre-treatment price level of the treatment group. Further, we observe
that in later auction format changes the increase in the price levels under
FPAs relative to price levels under SPAs dissipates over time, reminiscent of
the celebrated revenue equivalence theorem. We take this as evidence of
initially insufficient bid shading after the format change rather than an
immediate shift to a new Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Prices then went down as
bidders learned to shade their bids. We also show that bidders' sophistication
impacted their response to the auction format change. Our work constitutes one
of the first field studies on bidders' responses to auction format changes,
providing an important complement to theoretical model predictions. As such, it

Location-Adaptive Change-Point Testing for Time Series,2021-10-28T12:45:44Z,"Linlin Dai, Rui She","We propose a location-adaptive self-normalization (SN) based test for change
points in time series. The SN technique has been extensively used in
change-point detection for its capability to avoid direct estimation of
nuisance parameters. However, we find that the power of the SN-based test is
susceptible to the location of the break and may suffer from a severe power
loss, especially when the change occurs at the early or late stage of the
sequence. This phenomenon is essentially caused by the unbalance of the data
used before and after the change point when one is building a test statistic
based on the cumulative sum (CUSUM) process. Hence, we consider leaving out the
samples far away from the potential locations of change points and propose an
optimal data selection scheme. Based on this scheme, a new SN-based test
statistic adaptive to the locations of breaks is established. The new test can
significantly improve the power of the existing SN-based tests while
maintaining a satisfactory size. It is a unified treatment that can be readily
extended to tests for general quantities of interest, such as the median and
the model parameters. The derived optimal subsample selection strategy is not
specific to the SN-based tests but is applicable to any method that relies on
the CUSUM process, which may provide new insights in the area for future
research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15071v2

timely treatment or avoiding unnecessary confirmatory biopsies. In this work,
an efficient feature-based MR image registration is first developed to align

without chemical substitution. This technique, in combination with angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to
observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the
corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending
on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample
work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three
iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(Fe$_{0.94}$Co$_{0.06}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and
NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure
change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were
measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure
change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the

"Diff-Net: Image Feature Difference based High-Definition Map Change
  Detection for Autonomous Driving",2021-07-14T22:51:30Z,"Lei He, Shengjie Jiang, Xiaoqing Liang, Ning Wang, Shiyu Song","Up-to-date High-Definition (HD) maps are essential for self-driving cars. To
achieve constantly updated HD maps, we present a deep neural network (DNN),
Diff-Net, to detect changes in them. Compared to traditional methods based on
object detectors, the essential design in our work is a parallel feature
difference calculation structure that infers map changes by comparing features
extracted from the camera and rasterized images. To generate these rasterized
images, we project map elements onto images in the camera view, yielding
meaningful map representations that can be consumed by a DNN accordingly. As we
formulate the change detection task as an object detection problem, we leverage
the anchor-based structure that predicts bounding boxes with different change
status categories. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the
first end-to-end network that tackles the high-definition map change detection
task, yielding a single stage solution. Furthermore, rather than relying on
single frame input, we introduce a spatio-temporal fusion module that fuses
features from history frames into the current, thus improving the overall
performance. Finally, we comprehensively validate our method's effectiveness
using freshly collected datasets. Results demonstrate that our Diff-Net
achieves better performance than the baseline methods and is ready to be
integrated into a map production pipeline maintaining an up-to-date HD map.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07030v2
"Assessing Mediational Processes Using Piecewise Linear Growth Curve
  Models with Individual Measurement Occasions",2021-07-18T01:19:17Z,"Jin Liu, Robert A. Perera","Longitudinal processes often unfold concurrently where the growth of two or
more longitudinal outcomes are associated. Additionally, if the study under
investigation is long, the growth curves may exhibit nonconstant change with
respect to time. Multiple existing studies have developed multivariate growth
models with nonlinear functional forms to explore joint development where two
longitudinal records are correlated over time. However, the relationship
between multiple longitudinal outcomes may also be unidirectional. Accordingly,
it is of interest to estimate regression coefficients of such unidirectional
paths. One statistical tool for such analyses is longitudinal mediation models.
In this study, we develop two models to evaluate mediational processes where
the linear-linear piecewise growth model is utilized to capture the change
patterns. We define the mediational process as either the baseline covariate or
the change in covariate influencing the change in the mediator, which, in turn,
affects the change in the outcome. We present the proposed models through
simulation studies and real-world data analyses. Our simulation studies
demonstrate that the proposed mediational models can provide unbiased and
accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities with a 95%
confidence interval. The empirical analyses demonstrate that the proposed model
can estimate covariates' direct and indirect effects on the change in the
outcome. We also provide the corresponding code for the proposed models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08338v2
Towards Practical Integrity in the Smart Home with HomeEndorser,2021-09-10T23:48:51Z,"Kaushal Kafle, Kirti Jagtap, Mansoor Ahmed-Rengers, Trent Jaeger, Adwait Nadkarni","Home automation in modern smart home platforms is often facilitated using
trigger-action routines. While such routines enable flexible automation, they
also lead to an instance of the integrity problem in these systems: untrusted
third-parties may use platform APIs to modify the abstract home objects (AHOs)
that privileged, high-integrity devices such as security cameras rely on (i.e.,
as triggers), thereby transitively attacking them. As most accesses to AHOs are
legitimate, removing the permissions or applying naive information flow
controls would not only fail to prevent these problems, but also break useful
functionality. Therefore, this paper proposes the alternate approach of home
abstraction endorsement, which endorses a proposed change to an AHO by
correlating it with certain specific, preceding, environmental changes. We
present the HomeEndorser framework, which provides a policy model for
specifying endorsement policies for AHOs as changes in device states, relative
to their location, and a platform-based reference monitor for mediating all API
requests to change AHOs against those device states. We evaluate HomeEndorser
on the HomeAssistant platform, finding that we can derive over 1000 policy
rules for HomeEndorser to endorse changes to 6 key AHOs, preventing malice and
accidents for less than 10% overhead for endorsement check microbenchmarks, and
with no false alarms under realistic usage scenarios. In doing so, HomeEndorser
lays the first steps towards providing a practical foundation for ensuring that
API-induced changes to abstract home objects correlate with the physical
realities of the user's environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05139v1

spectroscopic and photometric results and present new observations. We reported
on the alteration in the spectral type of NGC 1566 in 2018 (REF1). Moreover, we
focused on the exceptional postmaximum behavior after 2018 July, when all bands
dropped with some fluctuations (REF2). We observed four significant
re-brightenings in the post-maximum period. We have found differences in X-ray

2018-2020. New post-maximum spectra covering the period 2018 November 31 to
2019 September 23 show dramatic changes compared to 2018 August 2, with fading

"Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Lane Changing of
  Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic",2021-11-11T17:17:24Z,"Wei Zhou, Dong Chen, Jun Yan, Zhaojian Li, Huilin Yin, Wanchen Ge","Autonomous driving has attracted significant research interests in the past
two decades as it offers many potential benefits, including releasing drivers
from exhausting driving and mitigating traffic congestion, among others.
Despite promising progress, lane-changing remains a great challenge for
autonomous vehicles (AV), especially in mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios.
Recently, reinforcement learning (RL), a powerful data-driven control method,
has been widely explored for lane-changing decision makings in AVs with
encouraging results demonstrated. However, the majority of those studies are
focused on a single-vehicle setting, and lane-changing in the context of
multiple AVs coexisting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have received scarce
attention. In this paper, we formulate the lane-changing decision making of
multiple AVs in a mixed-traffic highway environment as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where each AV makes lane-changing
decisions based on the motions of both neighboring AVs and HDVs. Specifically,
a multi-agent advantage actor-critic network (MA2C) is developed with a novel
local reward design and a parameter sharing scheme. In particular, a
multi-objective reward function is proposed to incorporate fuel efficiency,
driving comfort, and safety of autonomous driving. Comprehensive experimental
results, conducted under three different traffic densities and various levels
of human driver aggressiveness, show that our proposed MARL framework
consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of
efficiency, safety and driver comfort.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06318v2

More on Change-Making and Related Problems,2021-10-06T04:33:25Z,"Timothy M. Chan, Qizheng He","Given a set of $n$ integer-valued coin types and a target value $t$, the
well-known change-making problem asks for the minimum number of coins that sum
to $t$, assuming an unlimited number of coins in each type. In the more general
all-targets version of the problem, we want the minimum number of coins summing
to $j$, for every $j=0,\ldots,t$. For example, the textbook dynamic programming
algorithms can solve the all-targets problem in $O(nt)$ time. Recently, Chan
and He (SOSA'20) described a number of $O(t\,\textrm{polylog}\,t)$-time
algorithms for the original (single-target) version of the change-making
problem, but not the all-targets version.
  We obtain a number of new results on change-making and related problems,
including:
  1. A new algorithm for the all-targets change-making problem with running
time $\tilde{O}(t^{4/3})$, improving a previous $\tilde{O}(t^{3/2})$-time
algorithm.
  2. A very simple $\tilde{O}(u^2+t)$-time algorithm for the all-targets
change-making problem, where $u$ denotes the maximum coin value. The analysis
of the algorithm uses a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham (1972) on the Frobenius
problem. This algorithm can be extended to solve the all-capacities version of
the unbounded knapsack problem (for integer item weights bounded by $u$).
  3. For the original (single-target) coin changing problem, we describe a
simple modification of one of Chan and He's algorithms that runs in
$\tilde{O}(u)$ time (instead of $\tilde{O}(t)$).
  4. For the original (single-capacity) unbounded knapsack problem, we describe
a simple algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(nu)$ time, improving previous
near-$u^2$-time algorithms.
  5. We also observe how one of our ideas implies a new result on the minimum
word break problem, an optimization version of a string problem studied by
Bringmann et al. (FOCS'17), generalizing change-making (which corresponds to
the unary special case).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02503v1

Changes in Crime Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-19T00:05:31Z,"Mikaela Meyer, Ahmed Hassafy, Gina Lewis, Prasun Shrestha, Amelia M. Haviland, Daniel S. Nagin","We estimate changes in the rates of five FBI Part 1 crime (homicide, auto
theft, burglary, robbery, and larceny) during the COVID-19 pandemic from March
through December 2020. Using publicly available weekly crime count data from 29
of the 70 largest cities in the U.S. from January 2018 through December 2020,
three different linear regression model specifications are used to detect
changes. One detects whether crime trends in four 2020 pre- and post-pandemic
periods differ from those in 2018 and 2019. A second looks in more detail at
the spring 2020 lockdowns to detect whether crime trends changed over
successive biweekly periods into the lockdown. The third uses a city-level
openness index that we created for the purpose of examining whether the degree
of openness was associated with changing crime rates. For homicide and auto
theft, we find significant increases during all or most of the pandemic. By
contrast, we find significant declines in robbery and larceny during all or
part of the pandemic and no significant changes in burglary over the course of
the pandemic. Only larceny rates fluctuated with the degree of each city's
lockdown.
  It is unusual for crime rates to move in different directions, and the
reasons for the mixed findings for these five Part 1 Index crimes, one with no
change, two with sustained increases, and two with sustained decreases, are not
yet known. We hypothesize that the reasons may be related to changes in
opportunity, and the pandemic provides unique opportunities for future research
to better understand the forces impacting crime rates. In the absence of a
clear understanding of the mechanisms by which the pandemic affected crime, in
the spirit of evidence-based crime policy, we caution against advancing policy
at this time based on lessons learned from the pandemic ""natural experiment.""",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08859v1

Dynamic Meta-theorems for Distance and Matching,2021-09-04T14:12:24Z,"Samir Datta, Chetan Gupta, Rahul Jain, Anish Mukherjee, Vimal Raj Sharma, Raghunath Tewari","Reachability, distance, and matching are some of the most fundamental graph
problems that have been of particular interest in dynamic complexity theory in
recent years [DKMSZ18, DMVZ18, DKMTVZ20]. Reachability can be maintained with
first-order update formulas, or equivalently in DynFO in general graphs with n
nodes [DKMSZ18], even under O(log n/loglog n) changes per step [DMVZ18]. In the
context of how large the number of changes can be handled, it has recently been
shown [DKMTVZ20] that under a polylogarithmic number of changes, reachability
is in DynFOpar in planar, bounded treewidth, and related graph classes -- in
fact in any graph where small non-zero circulation weights can be computed in
NC.
  We continue this line of investigation and extend the meta-theorem for
reachability to distance and bipartite maximum matching with the same bounds.
These are amongst the most general classes of graphs known where we can
maintain these problems deterministically without using a majority quantifier
and even maintain witnesses. For the bipartite matching result, modifying the
approach from [FGT], we convert the static non-zero circulation weights to
dynamic matching-isolating weights.
  While reachability is in DynFOar under O(log n/loglog n) changes, no such
bound is known for either distance or matching in any non-trivial class of
graphs under non-constant changes. We show that, in the same classes of graphs
as before, bipartite maximum matching is in DynFOar under O(log n/loglog n)
changes per step. En route to showing this we prove that the rank of a matrix
can be maintained in DynFOar, also under O(log n/loglog n) entry changes,
improving upon the previous O(1) bound [DKMSZ18]. This implies similar
extension for the non-uniform DynFO bound for maximum matching in general
graphs and an alternate algorithm for maintaining reachability under O(log
n/loglog n) changes [DMVZ18].",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01875v2

highly sensitive to subtle changes of electronic band structures, it can be
finely tuned via external stimulus. Here, we demonstrate in SrRuO3 thin films
that both the magnitude and sign of anomalous Hall resistivity can be
effectively controlled with epitaxial strain. Our first-principles calculations
reveal that epitaxial strain induces an additional crystal field splitting and
changes the order of Ru d orbital energies, which alters the Berry curvature
and leads to the sign and magnitude change of anomalous Hall conductivity.
Furthermore, we show that the rotation of Ru magnetic moment in real space of
tensile strained sample can result in an exotic nonmonotonic change of
anomalous Hall resistivity with the sweeping of magnetic field, resembling the
topological Hall effect observed in non-coplanar spin systems. These findings

"Continual Active Learning for Efficient Adaptation of Machine Learning
  Models to Changing Image Acquisition",2021-06-07T05:39:06Z,"Matthias Perkonigg, Johannes Hofmanninger, Georg Langs","Imaging in clinical routine is subject to changing scanner protocols,
hardware, or policies in a typically heterogeneous set of acquisition hardware.
Accuracy and reliability of deep learning models suffer from those changes as
data and targets become inconsistent with their initial static training set.
Continual learning can adapt to a continuous data stream of a changing imaging
environment. Here, we propose a method for continual active learning on a data
stream of medical images. It recognizes shifts or additions of new imaging
sources - domains -, adapts training accordingly, and selects optimal examples
for labelling. Model training has to cope with a limited labelling budget,
resembling typical real world scenarios. We demonstrate our method on
T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from three different scanners with the
task of brain age estimation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms naive active learning while requiring less manual labelling.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03351v1
"Quickest change detection with unknown parameters: Constant complexity
  and near optimality",2021-06-09T13:29:26Z,"Firas Jarboui, Viannet Perchet","We consider the quickest change detection problem where both the parameters
of pre- and post- change distributions are unknown, which prevents the use of
classical simple hypothesis testing. Without additional assumptions, optimal
solutions are not tractable as they rely on some minimax and robust variant of
the objective. As a consequence, change points might be detected too late for
practical applications (in economics, health care or maintenance for instance).
Available constant complexity techniques typically solve a relaxed version of
the problem, deeply relying on very specific probability distributions and/or
some very precise additional knowledge. We consider a totally different
approach that leverages the theoretical asymptotic properties of optimal
solutions to derive a new scalable approximate algorithm with near optimal
performance that runs~in~$\mathcal{O}(1)$, adapted to even more complex

Online Bayesian inference for multiple changepoints and risk assessment,2021-05-31T13:09:09Z,"Olivier Sorba, C Geissler","The aim of the present study is to detect abrupt trend changes in the mean of
a multidimensional sequential signal. Directly inspired by papers of Fernhead

: the change dates of a time segmentation process trigger the renewal of a
piece-wise constant emission law. Bayesian posterior information on the change
dates and emission parameters is obtained. These estimations can be revised
online, i.e. as new data arrive. This paper proposes explicit formulations
corresponding to various emission laws, as well as a generalization to the case
where only partially observed data are available. Practical applications
include the returns of partially observed multi-asset investment strategies,
when only scant prior knowledge of the movers of the returns is at hand,
limited to some statistical assumptions. This situation is different from the
study of trend changes in the returns of individual assets, where fundamental
exogenous information (news, earnings announcements, controversies, etc.) can
be used.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05834v1

repertoire of behaviors as a function of age. We observe a sexually dimorphic
pattern of changes in the behavioral repertoire during aging. Although the
stereotypy of the behaviors and the complexity of the repertoire overall

Towards a Framework for Changing-Contact Robot Manipulation,2021-06-21T10:44:28Z,"Saif Sidhik, Mohan Sridharan, Dirk Ruiken","Many robot manipulation tasks require the robot to make and break contact
with objects and surfaces. The dynamics of such changing-contact robot
manipulation tasks are discontinuous when contact is made or broken, and
continuous elsewhere. These discontinuities make it difficult to construct and
use a single dynamics model or control strategy for any such task. We present a
framework for smooth dynamics and control of such changing-contact manipulation
tasks. For any given target motion trajectory, the framework incrementally
improves its prediction of when contacts will occur. This prediction and a
model relating approach velocity to impact force modify the velocity profile of
the motion sequence such that it is $C^\infty$ smooth, and help achieve a
desired force on impact. We implement this framework by building on our hybrid
force-motion variable impedance controller for continuous contact tasks. We

different properties.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10969v1

  Using Fault Current Limiters",2021-06-23T13:50:05Z,"Meisam Ansari, Mostafa Ansari","The use of distributed generation resources, in addition to considerable
benefits, causes some problems in the power system. One of the most critical
problems in the case of disruption is increasing short-circuit current level in
grids, which leads to change the protection devices settings in the downstream
and upstream grid. By using fault current limiters (FCL), short-circuit
currents in grids with distributed generation can be reduced to acceptable
levels, so there is no needed to change the protection relays settings of the
downstream grid (including distributed generations). However, by locating the
FCL in the tie-feeder, the downstream grid is not more effective than the
upstream grid and thus its reliability indices also will be changed. Therefore,
this paper shows that by locating the unidirectional fault current limiter
(UFCL) in the tie-feeder, the necessity of changing in the relay protection
settings of upstream grids is prevented. In this paper, the proposed method is
implemented, and its efficiency is reported in six scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12406v1
A Closer Look at How Fine-tuning Changes BERT,2021-06-27T17:01:43Z,"Yichu Zhou, Vivek Srikumar","Given the prevalence of pre-trained contextualized representations in today's
NLP, there have been many efforts to understand what information they contain,
and why they seem to be universally successful. The most common approach to use
these representations involves fine-tuning them for an end task. Yet, how
fine-tuning changes the underlying embedding space is less studied. In this
work, we study the English BERT family and use two probing techniques to
analyze how fine-tuning changes the space. We hypothesize that fine-tuning
affects classification performance by increasing the distances between examples
associated with different labels. We confirm this hypothesis with carefully
designed experiments on five different NLP tasks. Via these experiments, we
also discover an exception to the prevailing wisdom that ""fine-tuning always
improves performance"". Finally, by comparing the representations before and
after fine-tuning, we discover that fine-tuning does not introduce arbitrary
changes to representations; instead, it adjusts the representations to
downstream tasks while largely preserving the original spatial structure of the
data points.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14282v3

is challenging. Existing works resort to setting time-invariant thresholds that
focus on the expected runtime of the detector in the absence of change, either
bounding it loosely from below or targeting it directly but with asymptotic
arguments that we show cause significant miscalibration in practice. We present
a simulation-based approach to setting time-varying thresholds that allows a
desired expected runtime to be accurately targeted whilst additionally keeping
the false positive rate constant across time steps. Whilst the approach to
threshold setting is metric agnostic, we show how the cost of using the popular
quadratic time MMD estimator can be reduced from $O(N^2B)$ to $O(N^2+NB)$

Evolution of emotion semantics,2021-08-05T23:46:22Z,"Aotao Xu, Jennifer E. Stellar, Yang Xu","Humans possess the unique ability to communicate emotions through language.
Although concepts like anger or awe are abstract, there is a shared consensus
about what these English emotion words mean. This consensus may give the
impression that their meaning is static, but we propose this is not the case.
We cannot travel back to earlier periods to study emotion concepts directly,
but we can examine text corpora, which have partially preserved the meaning of
emotion words. Using natural language processing of historical text, we found
evidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that
varying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's
prototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of
""emotion"". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of
emotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more
established variables including usage frequency in English and a second
comparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not
consistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance
for predicting semantic change may be category-dependent. Our results suggest
emotion semantics are evolving over time, with prototypical emotion words

that in cases where the pair production opacity contributed by the soft disk
photons is modest, as in, e.g., M87, such changes can give rise to delayed,
strong TeV flares, dominated by curvature emission of particles accelerated in
the gap. The flare rise time, and the delay between the external variation and
the onset of the flare emitted from the outer gap boundary, are of the order of
the light crossing time of the gap. The rapid, large amplitude TeV flares

O(\kappa\sqrt{d\ln(d)})$, then every vertex almost surely changes its color
only finitely many times. Roughly, this implies that as $d\to \infty$, there is
a phase transition where $\kappa\theta/d = 1$. For the GHM dynamics, in the
scenario where every vertex changes color finitely many times, we moreover give
an exponential tail bound for the distribution of the time of the last color

  Detection",2021-08-24T09:25:17Z,"Jingyuan Liu, Ao Sun, Yuan Ke","Controlling false discovery rate (FDR) is crucial for variable selection,
multiple testing, among other signal detection problems. In literature, there
is certainly no shortage of FDR control strategies when selecting individual
features, but the relevant works for structural change detection, such as
profile analysis for piecewise constant coefficients and integration analysis
with multiple data sources, are limited. In this paper, we propose a
generalized knockoff procedure (GKnockoff) for FDR control under such problem
settings. We prove that the GKnockoff possesses pairwise exchangeability, and
is capable of controlling the exact FDR under finite sample sizes. We further
explore GKnockoff under high dimensionality, by first introducing a new
screening method to filter the high-dimensional potential structural changes.
We adopt a data splitting technique to first reduce the dimensionality via
screening and then conduct GKnockoff on the refined selection set. Furthermore,
the powers of proposed methods are systematically studied. Numerical
comparisons with other methods show the superior performance of GKnockoff, in
terms of both FDR control and power. We also implement the proposed methods to

polarization response of electromechanical systems to changes in an electric
field. We generalize that description to include a wide variety of responses to

Electromechanical systems can be found in many physical and biological
applications, such as ion transport in membranes, batteries, and dielectric
elastomers. We present a unified, thermodynamically consistent, variational
framework for modeling electromechanical systems as they respond to changes in
the electric field; that is to say, as they polarize. This framework is
motivated and developed using the classical energetic variational approach
(EnVarA). The coupling between the electric part and the chemo-mechanical parts
of the system is described either by Lagrange multipliers or various energy
relaxations. The classical polarization and its dielectrics and dielectric
constants appear as outputs of this analysis. The Maxwell equations then become
universal conservation laws of charge and current, conjoined to an
electromechanical description of polarization. Polarization describes the
entire electromechanical response to changes in the electric field and can
sometimes be approximated as a dielectric constant or dielectric dispersion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11512v2

tasks, including training simulators for orthopedic surgery or dentistry.
Current impedance devices cannot provide enough force and stiffness to render a
wall, and the high friction and inertia of admittance devices make it difficult
to render free space. We propose to address these limitations by combining
haptic augmented reality, untethered haptic interaction, and an
encountered-type haptic display. We attach a plate with the desired hardness on
the kinesthetic device's end-effector, which the user interacts with using an
untethered stylus. This method allows us to directly change the hardness of the
end-effector based on the rendered object. In this paper, we evaluate how
changing the hardness of the end-effector can mask the device's stiffness and
affect the user's perception. The results of our human subject experiment
indicate that when the end-effector is made of a hard material, it is difficult
for users to perceive when the underlying stiffness being rendered by the
device is changed, but this stiffness change is easy to distinguish while the
end-effector is made of a soft material. These results show promise for our
approach in avoiding the limitations of haptic devices when rendering hard

detect contact is affected by the mechatronic design of the robot, especially
its physical compliance. Established methods can design physical compliance for
many aspects of contact performance (e.g. peak contact force, motion/force
control bandwidth), but are based on time-invariant dynamic models. A change in
contact mode is a discrete change in coupled robot-environment dynamics, not
easily considered in existing design methods. Towards designing robots which
can robustly detect changes in contact mode online, this paper investigates how
mechatronic design can improve contact estimation, with a focus on the impact
of the location and degree of compliance. A design metric of information gain
is proposed which measures how much position/force measurements reduce
uncertainty in the contact mode estimate. This information gain is developed
for fully- and partially-observed systems, as partial observability can arise
from joint flexibility in the robot or environmental inertia. Hardware
experiments with various compliant setups validate that information gain
predicts the speed and certainty with which contact is detected in (i)
monitoring of contact-rich assembly and (ii) collision detection.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12435v2
Detecting model drift using polynomial relations,2021-10-24T18:25:21Z,"Eliran Roffe, Samuel Ackerman, Orna Raz, Eitan Farchi","Machine learning models serve critical functions, such as classifying loan
applicants as good or bad risks. Each model is trained under the assumption
that the data used in training and in the field come from the same underlying
unknown distribution. Often, this assumption is broken in practice. It is
desirable to identify when this occurs, to minimize the impact on model
performance.
  We suggest a new approach to detecting change in the data distribution by
identifying polynomial relations between the data features. We measure the
strength of each identified relation using its R-square value. A strong
polynomial relation captures a significant trait of the data which should
remain stable if the data distribution does not change. We thus use a set of
learned strong polynomial relations to identify drift. For a set of polynomial
relations that are stronger than a given threshold, we calculate the amount of
drift observed for that relation. The amount of drift is measured by
calculating the Bayes Factor for the polynomial relation likelihood of the
baseline data versus field data. We empirically validate the approach by
simulating a range of changes, and identify drift using the Bayes Factor of the
polynomial relation likelihood change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12506v2
"Testing and Estimating Structural Breaks in Time Series and Panel Data
  in Stata",2021-10-27T16:17:31Z,"Jan Ditzen, Yiannis Karavias, Joakim Westerlund","Identifying structural change is a crucial step in analysis of time series

model parameters have changed as a result of major disruptive events, such as
the 2007--2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID--19 outbreak. Detecting the
existence of breaks, and dating them is therefore necessary, not only for
estimation purposes but also for understanding drivers of change and their
effect on relationships. This article introduces a new community contributed
command called xtbreak, which provides researchers with a complete toolbox for
analysing multiple structural breaks in time series and panel data. xtbreak can
detect the existence of breaks, determine their number and location, and
provide break date confidence intervals. The new command is used to explore
changes in the relationship between COVID--19 cases and deaths in the US, using
both aggregate and state level data, and in the relationship between approval

"Sparsely Changing Latent States for Prediction and Planning in Partially
  Observable Domains",2021-10-29T17:50:44Z,"Christian Gumbsch, Martin V. Butz, Georg Martius","A common approach to prediction and planning in partially observable domains
is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which ideally develop and maintain
a latent memory about hidden, task-relevant factors. We hypothesize that many
of these hidden factors in the physical world are constant over time, changing
only sparsely. To study this hypothesis, we propose Gated $L_0$ Regularized
Dynamics (GateL0RD), a novel recurrent architecture that incorporates the
inductive bias to maintain stable, sparsely changing latent states. The bias is
implemented by means of a novel internal gating function and a penalty on the
$L_0$ norm of latent state changes. We demonstrate that GateL0RD can compete
with or outperform state-of-the-art RNNs in a variety of partially observable
prediction and control tasks. GateL0RD tends to encode the underlying
generative factors of the environment, ignores spurious temporal dependencies,
and generalizes better, improving sampling efficiency and overall performance
in model-based planning and reinforcement learning tasks. Moreover, we show
that the developing latent states can be easily interpreted, which is a step
towards better explainability in RNNs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15949v2

Marketing Mix Optimization with Practical Constraints,2021-01-11T02:10:19Z,"Hsin-Chan Huang, Jiefeng Xu, Alvin Lim","In this paper, we address a variant of the marketing mix optimization (MMO)
problem which is commonly encountered in many industries, e.g., retail and
consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries. This problem requires the spend for
each marketing activity, if adjusted, be changed by a non-negligible degree
(minimum change) and also the total number of activities with spend change be
limited (maximum number of changes). With these two additional practical
requirements, the original resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed
integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Given the size of a realistic problem in the
industrial setting, the state-of-the-art integer programming solvers may not be
able to solve the problem to optimality in a straightforward way within a
reasonable amount of time. Hence, we propose a systematic reformulation to ease
the computational burden. Computational tests show significant improvements in
the solution process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03663v1

Rotating vector model for magnetars,2021-01-11T02:28:26Z,"H. Tong, P. F. Wang, H. G. Wang, Z. Yan","The modification of the rotating vector model in the case of magnetars are
calculated. Magnetars may have twisted magnetic field compared with normal
pulsars. The polarization position angle of magnetars will change in the case
of a twisted magnetic field. For a twisted dipole field, we found that the
position angle will change both vertically and horizontally. During the
untwisting process of the magnetar magnetosphere, the modifications of the
position angle will evolve with time monotonously. This may explain the
evolution of the position angle in magnetar PSR J1622-4950 and XTE J1810-197.
The relation between the emission point and the line of sight will also change.
We suggest every magnetospheric models of magnetars also calculate the
corresponding changes of position angle in their models. Order of magnitude

appropriate state space and reward functions, and optimizes feasible actions in
an MPC fashion which are then sampled directly in the joint space considering

Leadership and Institutional Reforms,2021-01-21T16:28:31Z,"Matata Ponyo Mapon, Jean-Paul K. Tsasa","Large-scale institutional changes require strong commitment and involvement

difference between policy maker and political leader; (ii) formally study
interactions between a policy maker and his followers; (iii) examine the role
of leadership in the implementation of structural reforms. We show that a
policy maker can be both partisan and non-partisan, while a political leader
can only be non-partisan. Following this distinction, we derive the probability
of success of an institutional change, as well as the nature of the gain that
such a change would generate on the beneficiary population. Based on the
restrictions of this simple mathematical model and using some evidence from the

Distinction and Base Change,2021-02-21T13:32:49Z,U. K. Anandavardhanan,"An irreducible smooth representation of a $p$-adic group $G$ is said to be
distinguished with respect to a subgroup $H$ if it admits a non-trivial

distinction can be characterized in terms of the principle of functoriality. If
the involution is the Galois involution then a recent conjecture of Dipendra
Prasad predicts a formula for the dimension of the space of invariant linear
forms which once again involves base change. We will describe the proof of this
conjecture (in the generic case) for $SL(n)$ which is joint work with Dipendra
Prasad. Then we describe one more newly discovered connection between
distinction and base change which is that base change information appears in
the constant of proportionality between two natural invariant linear forms on a
distinguished representation. This latter result is for discrete series for

model can vary between different time segments. Such structure may arise in
social sciences/ economic sciences, such as sudden change of house price based
on external economic factor, crime rate changes based on social and

traditional convolutional kernels are fixed and cannot be changed according to
the actual structure of the SAR images. Besides, objects may appear with
different sizes in natural scenes, which requires the network to have stronger
multi-scale representation ability. In this paper, a novel

the proposed DRNet introduces the deformable convolutional sampling locations,

locations, 2-D offsets are calculated for each pixel according to the spatial
information of the input images. Then the sampling location of pixels can
adaptively reflect the spatial structure of the input images. Moreover, we
proposed a novel pooling module replacing the vanilla pooling to utilize
multi-scale information effectively, by constructing hierarchical residual-like

On Mixed Iterated Revisions,2021-04-08T07:34:56Z,Paolo Liberatore,"Several forms of iterable belief change exist, differing in the kind of
change and its strength: some operators introduce formulae, others remove them;
some add formulae unconditionally, others only as additions to the previous
beliefs; some only relative to the current situation, others in all possible
cases. A sequence of changes may involve several of them: for example, the
first step is a revision, the second a contraction and the third a refinement
of the previous beliefs. The ten operators considered in this article are shown
to be all reducible to three: lexicographic revision, refinement and severe
withdrawal. In turn, these three can be expressed in terms of lexicographic
revision at the cost of restructuring the sequence. This restructuring needs
not to be done explicitly: an algorithm that works on the original sequence is
shown. The complexity of mixed sequences of belief change operators is also
analyzed. Most of them require only a polynomial number of calls to a

and predictable outcome even in an incompletely specified or `open' system. We
formulate such `convergent operators' for configuration change in the language
of groups and rings and show that, in this form, the problem of convergent
reversibility becomes equivalent to the `division by zero' problem. Hence, we

"Direct Observation of Reversible Heat Absorption in Li-ion Battery
  Enabled by Ultra-Sensitive Thermometry",2021-07-01T17:25:38Z,"Zhe Cheng, Xiaoyang Ji, David G. Cahill","The reversible heat in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to entropy change is
fundamentally important for understanding the chemical reactions in LIBs and
developing proper thermal management strategies. However, the direct
measurements of reversible heat are challenging due to the limited temperature
resolution of applied thermometry. In this work, by developing an
ultra-sensitive thermometry with a differential AC bridge using two
thermistors, the noise-equivalent temperature resolution we achieve (10 uK) is
several orders of magnitude higher than previous thermometry applied on LIBs.
We directly observe reversible heat absorption of a LIR2032 coin cell during
charging with negligible irreversible heat generation and a linear relation
between heat generations and discharging currents. The cell entropy changes
determined from the reversible heat agree excellently with those measured from
temperature dependent open circuit voltage. Moreover, it is found that the
large reversible entropy change can cancel out the irreversible entropy
generation at a charging rate as large as C/3.7 and produce a
zero-heat-dissipation LIB during charging. Our work significantly contributes
to fundamental understanding of the entropy changes and heat generations of the
chemical reactions in LIBs, and reveals that reversible heat absorption can be
an effective way to cool LIBs during charging.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00625v1
Inferring the drivers of language change using spatial models,2021-07-05T14:33:18Z,"James Burridge, Tamsin Blaxter","Discovering and quantifying the drivers of language change is a major
challenge. Hypotheses about causal factors proliferate, but are difficult to
rigorously test. Here we ask a simple question: can 20th Century changes in
English English be explained as a consequence of spatial diffusion, or have
other processes created bias in favour of certain linguistic forms? Using two
of the most comprehensive spatial datasets available, which measure the state
of English at the beginning and end of the 20th century, we calibrate a simple
spatial model so that, initialised with the early state, it evolves into the
later. Our calibrations reveal that while some changes can be explained by
diffusion alone, others are clearly the result of substantial asymmetries
between variants. We discuss the origins of these asymmetries and, as a
by-product, we generate a full spatio-temporal prediction for the spatial
evolution of English features over the 20th Century, and a prediction of the
future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02056v1

adaptations when faced with new environments. In this paper, we propose a
principled framework for adaptive RL, called \textit{AdaRL}, that adapts
reliably and efficiently to changes across domains with a few samples from the
target domain, even in partially observable environments. Specifically, we
leverage a parsimonious graphical representation that characterizes structural
relationships over variables in the RL system. Such graphical representations
provide a compact way to encode what and where the changes across domains are,
and furthermore inform us with a minimal set of changes that one has to
consider for the purpose of policy adaptation. We show that by explicitly
leveraging this compact representation to encode changes, we can efficiently
adapt the policy to the target domain, in which only a few samples are needed
and further policy optimization is avoided. We illustrate the efficacy of AdaRL
through a series of experiments that vary factors in the observation,
transition, and reward functions for Cartpole and Atari games.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02729v4

subproblems: multi-session SLAM (MSS), high/low dynamic change detection, and
positive/negative change management. The proposed method leverages MSS and
handles potential trajectory error; thus, good initial alignment is not
required for change detection. Our change management scheme preserves efficacy

treated within the mean-field approximation, we provide and explore its
implications on the field-induced entropy change in metallic system with phase
separation. Chosen framework allows us to properly analyze phase volumes'
dependence on parameters of phase-separated (PS) system. Moreover, an account
for phase separation boundaries as functions of magnetic field provides a
natural splitting of the PS region, where each subregion corresponds to a
different temperature dependence of entropy change: moving from one subregion
to the other produces a kink, followed by a strong linear growth of entropy
change. We encounter a second-order magnetic transition from paramagnetic to
antiferromagnetic phase in PS region that occurs for particular parameter
values. Despite the fact that both phases have zero total magnetization, the

intervention's theory of change provides guidance as to which of those
observations are best situated to exhibit that treatment effect. Our
power-maximizing weighting for repeated-measurements with delayed-effects
scheme, PWRD aggregation, converts the theory of change into a test statistic
with improved asymptotic relative efficiency, delivering tests with greater
statistical power. We illustrate this method on an IES-funded cluster
randomized trial testing the efficacy of a reading intervention designed to
assist early elementary students at risk of falling behind their peers. The

we propose a novel paradigm for the efficient tuning of second-harmonic
generation (SHG) process in dielectric nanoantennas by integrating with
chalcogenide phase change material. In a design with Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$

the nonlinear SHG signal from the AlGaAs nanoantennas can be boosted via the
resonantly localized field induced by the optically-induced Mie-type

The tuning strategy originates from the modulation of resonant conditions by
changes in the refractive index of GST. With a thorough examination of tuning
performances for different nanoantenna radii, a maximum modulation depth as
high as 540$\%$ is numerically demonstrated. This work not only reveals out the
potential of GST in optical nonlinearity control, but also provides promising
strategy in smart designing tunable and reconfigurable nonlinear optical

presented here. Modeling efforts have focused on describing those
physiologically realistic mechanisms which govern the regulation of membrane
permeability in nerve. The motivation behind identifying such mechanisms lies
in understanding the morphology of neural activity on a meaningful and
analytically tractable level. The suggested merit of integrating control theory
into the analysis lies in providing how a membrane effectively adapts to
changes in permeability and through what governing mechanisms. The value in
producing such an understanding lies in mirroring biological reality in a more
formal manner than could be achieved solely through experimental means. A
bang-bang control policy describing the permeability correction mechanisms is
developed using Liapunov's Stability Criteria. Both changes in membrane
potential and kinetic rates are required to implement the policy. The policy
describes the inherent mechanisms of the membrane which act to drive its
permeability from unstable firing to the resting potential state. It is shown
that these permeability changes in state are governed by a switching function
that depends on the membrane potential and a dominant controlling parameter.
The control policy is discussed in the context of solutions of the

discrete (mirror) symmetry in one of the degrees-of-freedom. This changes the
dynamics drastically depending on the frequency ratio $\omega$ and the
timescale of evolution. We analyse the cases $\omega = 1, 2, 3$ where the
ratio's 1,2 turn out to be the most interesting. In an initial phase we find 2

Contemporary VFL methods are mainly used in static scenarios where the active

wavefunction-overlap and more efficient connectivity for the current flow.
X-ray, and electron-beam diffraction experiments indicate that the heat-treated

with perihelion 1 AU and aphelion 3 AU ($a = 2\,$AU, $e = 0.5$) may be
displaced along its path by $\sim 1000\,$km in 100 years, sufficient to avoid
impact in a populated area, by application of one kg of lithium or sodium metal
over its entire surface. Alternatively, coating one hemisphere of an asteroid
in an elliptical orbit may produce a Solar radiation torque, analogous to but
distinct from the Yarkovsky effect, displacing it by an Earth radius in $\sim
200$ years. The time required scales as the square root of the asteroid's
diameter (the 1/6 power of its mass) because the displacement increases
quadratically with time, making it possible to prevent the catastrophic impact
of a km-sized asteroid with a minimal mass.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03501v1

found that the anomaly in R (T) at the structural transition for the former

indicates a change in the type of the ground state in the studied compounds.
Within the framework of the crystal field model, this can be explained as a
consequence of a change in the distortion of the tetrahedral environment of
iron, which leads to a change in the positions of the energy levels within

Segmenting Time Series via Self-Normalization,2021-12-10T04:24:43Z,"Zifeng Zhao, Feiyu Jiang, Xiaofeng Shao","We propose a novel and unified framework for change-point estimation in
multivariate time series. The proposed method is fully nonparametric, enjoys
effortless tuning and is robust to temporal dependence. One salient and
distinct feature of the proposed method is its versatility, where it allows
change-point detection for a broad class of parameters (such as mean, variance,
correlation and quantile) in a unified fashion. At the core of our method, we
couple the self-normalization (SN) based tests with a novel nested local-window
segmentation algorithm, which seems new in the growing literature of
change-point analysis. Due to the presence of an inconsistent long-run variance
estimator in the SN test, non-standard theoretical arguments are further
developed to derive the consistency and convergence rate of the proposed
SN-based change-point detection method. Extensive numerical experiments and
relevant real data analysis are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and
broad applicability of our proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art
approaches in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05331v3

concerns around Android apps have been studied by many past works. Over the
past 10 years, we have crawled and scraped data for almost 1.9 million apps,
and also stored the APKs for 135,536 of them. In this paper, we examine the
trends in how Android apps have changed over time with respect to privacy and
look at it from two perspectives: (1) how privacy behavior in apps have changed
as they are updated over time, (2) how these changes can be accounted for when
comparing third-party libraries and the app's own internals. To study this, we
examine the adoption of HTTPS, whether apps scan the device for other installed
apps, the use of permissions for privacy-sensitive data, and the use of unique
identifiers. We find that privacy-related behavior has improved with time as
apps continue to receive updates, and that the third-party libraries used by

An AGM Approach to Revising Preferences,2021-12-28T18:12:57Z,"Adrian Haret, Johannes P. Wallner","We look at preference change arising out of an interaction between two

preference. The aim is to adjust the initial preference and bring it in line
with the new preference, without having to give up more information than
necessary. We model this process using the formal machinery of belief change,
along the lines of the well-known AGM approach. We propose a set of fundamental
rationality postulates, and derive the main results of the paper: a set of
representation theorems showing that preference change according to these
postulates can be rationalized as a choice function guided by a ranking on the
comparisons in the initial preference order. We conclude by presenting
operators satisfying our proposed postulates. Our approach thus allows us to

spectrograph at the 10 m Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET). Due to its fixed
altitude design, the HET pupil changes appreciably across a track, leading to
significant changes of the fiber far-field illumination. HPF's fiber scrambler
is designed to suppress the impact of these illumination changes on the radial
velocities -- but the residual impact on the radial velocity measurements has
yet to be probed on sky. We use GJ 411, a bright early type (M2) M dwarf to
probe the effects of far-field input trends due to these pupil variations on
HPF radial velocities (RVs). These large changes ($\sim$ 2x) in pupil area and
centroid present a harsh test of HPF's far-field scrambling. Our results show
that the RVs are effectively decoupled from these extreme far-field input
changes due to pupil centroid offsets, attesting to the effectiveness of the
scrambler design. This experiment allows us to test the impact of these changes
with large pupil variation on-sky, something we would not easily be able to do
at a conventional optical telescope. While the pupil and illumination changes

  Re-identification",2021-08-10T09:14:44Z,"Zan Gao, Hongwei Wei, Weili Guan, Weizhi Nie, Meng Liu, Meng Wang","Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine
learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been
proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the
same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance
must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person
has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they
also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing
person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.
To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,
but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for
representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be
improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve
these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding
algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual
semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and
the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively
solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a
person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme
(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth
desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of
the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level
human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of
pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially
semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic
information that is used to align the human attributes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1

which introductory students acquire scientific knowledge. However, with modern
developments in science and technology, the social significance of learning
successive theories is steadily increasing, thus opening new areas of interest
to discipline-based education research, e.g., quantum logic, quantum
information and communication. Here we present an initial proposal for modeling
the transition from the understanding of a theory to the understanding of its
successor and explore its generative potential by applying it to a concrete
case: the classical-quantum transition in physics. In pursue of such task, we
make coordinated use of contributions not only from research on conceptual
change in education, but also on the history and philosophy of science, on the
teaching and learning of quantum mechanics, on mathematics education. By means
of analytical instruments developed for characterizing conceptual trajectories
at different representational levels, we review empirical literature in the
search for the connections between theory change and cognitive demands. The
analysis shows a rich landscape of changes and new challenges that are absent
in the traditionally considered cases of conceptual change. In order to fully
disclose the educational potential of the analysis, we visualize categorical
changes by means of dynamic frames, identifying recognizable patterns that
answer to students' need of comparability between the older and the new

  Behaviors Using Measurement Data from a Customer Fleet",2021-06-23T07:29:19Z,"Florian WirthmÃ¼ller, Jochen Hipp, Christian ReichenbÃ¤cher, Manfred Reichert","The prediction of surrounding traffic participants behavior is a crucial and
challenging task for driver assistance and autonomous driving systems. Today's
approaches mainly focus on modeling dynamic aspects of the traffic situation
and try to predict traffic participants behavior based on this. In this article
we take a first step towards extending this common practice by calculating
location-specific a-priori lane change probabilities. The idea behind this is
straight forward: The driving behavior of humans may vary in exactly the same
traffic situation depending on the respective location. E.g. drivers may ask
themselves: Should I pass the truck in front of me immediately or should I wait
until reaching the less curvy part of my route lying only a few kilometers
ahead? Although, such information is far away from allowing behavior prediction
on its own, it is obvious that today's approaches will greatly benefit when
incorporating such location-specific a-priori probabilities into their
predictions. For example, our investigations show that highway interchanges
tend to enhance driver's motivation to perform lane changes, whereas curves
seem to have lane change-dampening effects. Nevertheless, the investigation of
all considered local conditions shows that superposition of various effects can
lead to unexpected probabilities at some locations. We thus suggest dynamically
constructing and maintaining a lane change probability map based on customer
fleet data in order to support onboard prediction systems with additional
information. For deriving reliable lane change probabilities a broad customer
fleet is the key to success.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04029v2

  Paradox",2021-03-01T06:24:32Z,Geoffrey Ducournau,"One of the greatest contributors of the 20th century among all academician in
the field of statistical finance, M. F. M. Osborne published in 1956 [6] an
essential paper and proposed to treat the question of stock market motion
through the prism of both the Law of Weber-Fechner [1, 4] and the branch of
physics developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and Josiah Willard
Gibbs [3, 5] namely the statistical mechanics. He proposed an improvement of
the known research made by his predecessor Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse
Bachelier, by not considering the arithmetic changes of stock prices as means
of statistical measurement, but by drawing on the Weber-Fechner Law, to treat
the changes of prices. Osborne emphasized that as in statistical mechanics, the
probability distribution of the steady-state of subjective change in prices is
determined by the condition of maximum probability, a statement close to the
Gibbs distribution conditions. However, Osborne also admitted that the
empirical observation of the probability distribution of logarithmic changes of
stock prices was emphasizing obvious asymmetries and consequently could not
perfectly confirm his prior theory. The purpose of this paper is to propose an
explanation to what we could call the Osborne paradox and then address an
alternative approach via Bayesian inference regarding the description of the
probability distribution of changes in logarithms of prices that was
thenceforth under the prism of frequentist inference. We show that the stock
market returns are locally described by equilibrium statistical mechanics with
conserved statistics variables, whereas globally there is yet other statistics
with persistent flowing variables that can be effectively described by a
superposition of several statistics on different time scales, namely, a
superstatistics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00788v1

black hole, the shadow and observation properties of the black hole surrounded
by various accretion models are studied. We analyzed the changes in shadow
imaging and observation luminosity when the relevant physical parameters are
changed. For the different spherical accretions background, one can find that
the radius of shadow and the position of photon sphere do not change, but the
observation intensity of shadow in the infalling accretion model is
significantly lower than that of the static case. When the black hole is
surrounded by an optically and thin disk accretion, the contribution of the
photon rings, lensing rings and direct emission to the total observed flux has
also been studied. Under the different forms of the emission modes, the result
shows that the observed brightness is mainly determined by direct emission,
while the lensing rings will provide a small part of the observation flux and
the photon ring can provide a negligible observation flux. By comparing our
results with the Schwarzschild spacetime, it is found that the existence or
change of relevant status parameters will greatly affect the shape and
observation intensity of black hole shadow. These results support that the

Step-Change in Friction under Electrovibration,2021-03-30T16:45:27Z,"Idil Ozdamar, M. Reza Alipour, Benoit P. Delhaye, Philippe Lef`evre, Cagatay Basdogan","Rendering tactile effects on a touch screen via electrovibration has many

in friction and the underlying contact mechanics are both very limited. In this
study, we investigate the tactile perception and the contact mechanics for a
step change in friction under electrovibration during a relative sliding
between finger and the surface of a capacitive touchscreen. First, we conduct
magnitude estimation experiments to investigate the role of normal force and
sliding velocity on the perceived tactile intensity for a step increase and
decrease in friction, called as rising friction (RF) and falling friction (FF).
To investigate the contact mechanics involved in RF and FF, we then measure the
frictional force, the apparent contact area, and the strains acting on the
fingerpad during sliding at a constant velocity under three different normal
loads using a custom-made experimental set-up. The results show that the
participants perceived RF stronger than FF, and both the normal force and
sliding velocity significantly influenced their perception. These results are
supported by our mechanical measurements; the relative change in friction, the
apparent contact area, and the strain in the sliding direction were all higher
for RF than those for FF, especially for low normal forces. Taken together, our
results suggest that different contact mechanics take place during RF and FF
due to the viscoelastic behavior of fingerpad skin, and those differences
influence our tactile perception of a step change in friction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16489v1
"Counterfactual Invariance to Spurious Correlations: Why and How to Pass
  Stress Tests",2021-05-31T14:39:38Z,"Victor Veitch, Alexander D'Amour, Steve Yadlowsky, Jacob Eisenstein","Informally, a 'spurious correlation' is the dependence of a model on some
aspect of the input data that an analyst thinks shouldn't matter. In machine
learning, these have a know-it-when-you-see-it character; e.g., changing the
gender of a sentence's subject changes a sentiment predictor's output. To check
for spurious correlations, we can 'stress test' models by perturbing irrelevant
parts of input data and seeing if model predictions change. In this paper, we
study stress testing using the tools of causal inference. We introduce
counterfactual invariance as a formalization of the requirement that changing
irrelevant parts of the input shouldn't change model predictions. We connect
counterfactual invariance to out-of-domain model performance, and provide
practical schemes for learning (approximately) counterfactual invariant
predictors (without access to counterfactual examples). It turns out that both
the means and implications of counterfactual invariance depend fundamentally on
the true underlying causal structure of the data -- in particular, whether the
label causes the features or the features cause the label. Distinct causal
structures require distinct regularization schemes to induce counterfactual
invariance. Similarly, counterfactual invariance implies different domain shift
guarantees depending on the underlying causal structure. This theory is
supported by empirical results on text classification.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00545v3
QWin: Enforcing Tail Latency SLO at Shared Storage Backend,2021-06-17T02:10:14Z,"Liuying Ma, Zhenqing Liu, Jin Xiong, Dejun Jiang","Consolidating latency-critical (LC) and best-effort (BE) tenants at storage
backend helps to increase resources utilization. Even if tenants use dedicated
queues and threads to achieve performance isolation, threads are still contend
for CPU cores. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to partition cores
between LC and BE tenants, and meanwhile each core is dedicated to run a
thread. Expect for frequently changing bursty load, fluctuated service time at
storage backend also drastically changes the need of cores. In order to
guarantee tail latency service level objectives (SLOs), the abrupt changing
need of cores must be satisfied immediately. Otherwise, tail latency SLO
violation happens. Unfortunately, partitioning-based approaches lack the
ability to react the changing need of cores, resulting in extreme spikes in
latency and SLO violation happens. In this paper, we present QWin, a tail
latency SLO aware core allocation to enforce tail latency SLO at shared storage
backend. QWin consists of an SLO-to-core calculation model that accurately
calculates the number of cores combining with definitive runtime load
determined by a flexible request-based window, and an autonomous core
allocation that adjusts cores at adaptive frequency by dynamically changing
core policies. When consolidating multiple LC and BE tenants, QWin outperforms
the-state-of-the-art approaches in guaranteeing tail latency SLO for LC tenants

Do people's user types change over time? An exploratory study,2021-06-18T14:25:21Z,"Ana ClÃ¡udia GuimarÃ£es Santos, Wilk Oliveira, Juho Hamari, Seiji Isotani","In recent years, different studies have proposed and validated user models
(e.g., Bartle, BrainHex, and Hexad) to represent the different user profiles in
games and gamified settings. However, the results of applying these user models
in practice (e.g., to personalize gamified systems) are still contradictory.
One of the hypotheses for these results is that the user types can change over
time (i.e., user types are dynamic). To start to understand whether user types
can change over time, we conducted an exploratory study analyzing data from 74
participants to identify if their user type (Achiever, Philanthropist,
Socialiser, Free Spirit, Player, and Disruptor) had changed over time (six
months). The results indicate that there is a change in the dominant user type
of the participants, as well as the average scores in the Hexad sub-scales.
These results imply that all the scores should be considered when defining the
Hexad's user type and that the user types are dynamic. Our results contribute
with practical implications, indicating that the personalization currently made

"Identifying Wetland Areas in Historical Maps using Deep Convolutional
  Neural Networks",2021-08-09T15:08:07Z,"Niclas StÃ¥hl, Lisa Weimann","1) The local environment and land usages have changed a lot during the past
one hundred years. Historical documents and materials are crucial in
understanding and following these changes. Historical documents are, therefore,
an important piece in the understanding of the impact and consequences of land
usage change. This, in turn, is important in the search of restoration projects
that can be conducted to turn and reduce harmful and unsustainable effects
originating from changes in the land-usage.
  2) This work extracts information on the historical location and geographical
distribution of wetlands, from hand-drawn maps. This is achieved by using deep
learning (DL), and more specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). The
CNN model is trained on a manually pre-labelled dataset on historical wetlands
in the area of J\""onk\""oping county in Sweden. These are all extracted from the
historical map called ""Generalstabskartan"".
  3) The presented CNN performs well and achieves a $F_1$-score of 0.886 when
evaluated using a 10-fold cross validation over the data. The trained models
are additionally used to generate a GIS layer of the presumable historical
geographical distribution of wetlands for the area that is depicted in the
southern collection in Generalstabskartan, which covers the southern half of
Sweden. This GIS layer is released as an open resource and can be freely used.
  4) To summarise, the presented results show that CNNs can be a useful tool in
the extraction and digitalisation of non-textual information in historical
documents, such as historical maps. A modern GIS material that can be used to
further understand the past land-usage change is produced within this research.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04107v1
Lifelong Computing,2021-08-19T17:19:52Z,"Danny Weyns, Thomas BÃ¤ck, RenÃ¨ Vidal, Xin Yao, Ahmed Nabil Belbachir","Computing systems form the backbone of many aspects of our life, hence they
are becoming as vital as water, electricity, and road infrastructures for our
society. Yet, engineering long running computing systems that achieve their
goals in ever-changing environments pose significant challenges. Currently, we
can build computing systems that adjust or learn over time to match changes
that were anticipated. However, dealing with unanticipated changes, such as
anomalies, novelties, new goals or constraints, requires system evolution,
which remains in essence a human-driven activity. Given the growing complexity
of computing systems and the vast amount of highly complex data to process,
this approach will eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status

systems that we coin ""lifelong computing."" The paradigm starts from
computing-learning systems that integrate computing/service modules and
learning modules. Computing warehouses offer such computing elements together
with data sheets and usage guides. When detecting anomalies, novelties, new
goals or constraints, a lifelong computing system activates an evolutionary
self-learning engine that runs online experiments to determine how the
computing-learning system needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby
changing its architecture and integrating new computing elements from computing
warehouses as needed. Depending on the domain at hand, some activities of
lifelong computing systems can be supported by humans. We motivate the need for

Change of Basis between Classical Orthogonal Polynomials,2021-08-31T05:59:02Z,D. A. Wolfram,"Classical orthogonal polynomials have widespread applications including in
numerical integration, solving differential equations, and interpolation.
Changing basis between classical orthogonal polynomials can affect the
convergence, accuracy, and stability of solutions.
  We provide a general method for changing basis between any pair of classical
orthogonal polynomials by using algebraic expressions called coefficient
functions that evaluate to connection coefficients. The method builds directly
on previous work on the change of basis groupoid. The scope has fifteen kinds
of classical orthogonal polynomials including the classes of Jacobi, Gegenbauer
and generalized Laguerre polynomials.
  The method involves the mappings to and from the monomials for these
polynomial bases. Sixteen coefficient functions appear to be new for
polynomials that do not have definite parity. We derive the remainder from
seven sources in the literature. We give a complete summary of thirty
coefficient functions.
  This enables change of basis to be defined algebraically and uniformly
between any pair of classical orthogonal polynomial bases by using a vector dot
product to compose two coefficient functions to give a third.
  A definition of Jacobi polynomials uses a basis of shifted monomials. We find
a key new mapping between the monomials and Jacobi polynomials by using a
general mapping between shifted monomials and monomials. It yields new mappings
for the Chebyshev polynomials of the third and fourth kinds and their shifted

Physical Context and Timing Aware Sequence Generating GANs,2021-09-28T07:58:53Z,"Hayato Futase, Tomoki Tsujimura, Tetsuya Kajimoto, Hajime Kawarazaki, Toshiyuki Suzuki, Makoto Miwa, Yutaka Sasaki","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable successes in
generating realistic images and interpolating changes between images. Existing
models, however, do not take into account physical contexts behind images in

difficult to generate the changes at a specific timing and they often do not
match with actual changes. This paper proposes a novel GAN, named Physical
Context and Timing aware sequence generating GANs (PCTGAN), that generates an
image in a sequence at a specific timing between two images with considering
physical contexts behind them. Our method consists of three components: an
encoder, a generator, and a discriminator. The encoder estimates latent vectors
from the beginning and ending images, their timings, and a target timing. The
generator generates images and the physical contexts at the beginning, ending,
and target timing from the corresponding latent vectors. The discriminator
discriminates whether the generated images and contexts are real or not. In the
experiments, PCTGAN is applied to a data set of sequential changes of shapes in
die forging processes. We show that both timing and physical contexts are
effective in generating sequential images.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04077v1

Poisson process, the data are binned into 4D grids of voxels (time, energy
band, and x-y coordinates), and viewed as a time series of non-homogeneous
Poisson images. The method assumes that at each time point, the corresponding
multi-band image stack is an unknown 3D piecewise constant function including
Poisson noise. It also assumes that all image stacks between any two adjacent

locations of all the change points (in time domain), as well as all the unknown
piecewise constant functions between any pairs of the change points. The method
applies the minimum description length (MDL) principle to perform this task. A
practical algorithm is also developed to solve the corresponding complicated
optimization problem. Simulation experiments and applications to real datasets

Low-skilled Occupations Face the Highest Upskilling Pressure,2021-01-27T16:02:57Z,"Di Tong, Lingfei Wu, James Allen Evans","Substantial scholarship has estimated the susceptibility of jobs to
automation, but little has examined how job contents evolve in the information
age as new technologies substitute for tasks, shifting required skills rather
than eliminating entire jobs. Here we explore patterns of occupational skill
change and characterize occupations and workers subject to the greatest
reskilling requirements. Recent work found that changing skill requirements are
greatest for STEM occupations in the 2010s. Nevertheless, analyzing 167 million
online job posts covering 727 occupations, we find that skill change is
greatest for low-skilled occupations when accounting for distance between
skills. We further investigate the differences in skill change across employer
and market size, as well as social demographic groups. We find that jobs from
small employers and markets experienced larger skill upgrades to catch up with
the skill demands of their large employers and markets. Female and minority
workers are disproportionately employed in low-skilled jobs and face the most
significant skill adjustments. While these varied skill changes could create
uneven reskilling pressures across workers, they may also lead to a narrowing

genome-scale transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, with the hope of
deconvolving cellular dynamic changes in corresponding cell sub-populations to
better understand molecular mechanisms of different development processes.
Several scRNA-seq analysis methods have been proposed to first identify cell
sub-populations by clustering and then separately perform differential
expression analysis to understand gene expression changes. Their corresponding
statistical models and inference algorithms are often designed disjointly. We
develop a new method -- SimCD -- that explicitly models cell heterogeneity and
dynamic differential changes in one unified hierarchical gamma-negative
binomial (hGNB) model, allowing simultaneous cell clustering and differential
expression analysis for scRNA-seq data. Our method naturally defines cell
heterogeneity by dynamic expression changes, which is expected to help achieve
better performances on the two tasks compared to the existing methods that
perform them separately. In addition, SimCD better models dropout (zero
inflation) in scRNA-seq data by both cell- and gene-level factors and obviates
the need for sophisticated pre-processing steps such as normalization, thanks
to the direct modeling of scRNA-seq count data by the rigorous hGNB model with
an efficient Gibbs sampling inference algorithm. Extensive comparisons with the

  network",2021-04-05T21:29:12Z,"Quynh-Anh Nguyen, Leonid L Rubchinsky","Synchronization in neural system plays an important role in many brain
functions. Synchronization in the gamma frequency band (30Hz-100Hz) is involved
in a variety of cognitive phenomena; abnormalities of the gamma synchronization
are found in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Frequently, the
strength of synchronization is not very high and is intermittent even on short
time scales (a few cycles of oscillations). That is, the network exhibits
intervals of synchronization followed by intervals of desynchronization. Neural
circuits dynamics may show different distributions of desynchronization
durations even if the synchronization strength is fixed. In this study, we use
a conductance-based neural network exhibiting pyramidal-interneuron (PING)
gamma rhythm to study the temporal patterning of synchronized neural
oscillations. We found that changes in the synaptic strength (as well as
changes in the membrane kinetics) can alter the temporal patterning of
synchrony. Moreover, we found that the changes in the temporal pattern of
synchrony may be independent of the changes in the average synchrony strength.
Even though the temporal patterning may vary, there is a tendency for dynamics
with short (although potentially numerous) desynchronizations, similar to what
was observed in experimental studies of neural activity synchronization in the
brain. Recent studies suggested that the short desynchronizations dynamics may
facilitate the formation and the break-up of transient neural assemblies. Thus,
the results of this study suggest that changes of synaptic strength may alter
the temporal patterning of the gamma synchronization as to make the neural
networks more efficient in the formation of neural assemblies and the
facilitation of cognitive phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02163v1

changes in the pi-pi peak and diffuse scatter in situ, while capturing the
solvent swollen thin film structure which was inaccessible in previous ex situ
studies. These in situ measurements improve the sensitivity to structural
changes, capturing minute changes not possible ex situ, and have multimodal
potential such as combined Raman measurements that also serve to validate the

  Collaborative Dynamic Bandit Solution",2021-04-14T22:15:58Z,"Chuanhao Li, Qingyun Wu, Hongning Wang","Collaborative bandit learning, i.e., bandit algorithms that utilize
collaborative filtering techniques to improve sample efficiency in online
interactive recommendation, has attracted much research attention as it enjoys
the best of both worlds. However, all existing collaborative bandit learning
solutions impose a stationary assumption about the environment, i.e., both user
preferences and the dependency among users are assumed static over time.
Unfortunately, this assumption hardly holds in practice due to users'
ever-changing interests and dependence relations, which inevitably costs a
recommender system sub-optimal performance in practice.
  In this work, we develop a collaborative dynamic bandit solution to handle a
changing environment for recommendation. We explicitly model the underlying
changes in both user preferences and their dependency relation as a stochastic
process. Individual user's preference is modeled by a mixture of globally
shared contextual bandit models with a Dirichlet Process prior. Collaboration
among users is thus achieved via Bayesian inference over the global bandit
models. Model selection and arm selection for each user are done via Thompson
sampling to balance exploitation and exploration. Our solution is proved to
maintain a standard $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ sublinear regret even in such a
challenging environment. And extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic

  The most important findings in this paper are as follows: 1) incorrect

Concept Drift Detection from Multi-Class Imbalanced Data Streams,2021-04-20T20:03:54Z,"Åukasz Korycki, Bartosz Krawczyk","Continual learning from data streams is among the most important topics in
contemporary machine learning. One of the biggest challenges in this domain
lies in creating algorithms that can continuously adapt to arriving data.
However, previously learned knowledge may become outdated, as streams evolve
over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and must be detected to
facilitate efficient adaptation of the learning model. While there exists a
plethora of drift detectors, all of them assume that we are dealing with
roughly balanced classes. In the case of imbalanced data streams, those
detectors will be biased towards the majority classes, ignoring changes
happening in the minority ones. Furthermore, class imbalance may evolve over
time and classes may change their roles (majority becoming minority and vice
versa). This is especially challenging in the multi-class setting, where
relationships among classes become complex. In this paper, we propose a
detailed taxonomy of challenges posed by concept drift in multi-class
imbalanced data streams, as well as a novel trainable concept drift detector
based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine. It is capable of monitoring multiple
classes at once and using reconstruction error to detect changes in each of
them independently. Our detector utilizes a skew-insensitive loss function that
allows it to handle multiple imbalanced distributions. Due to its trainable
nature, it is capable of following changes in a stream and evolving class
roles, as well as it can deal with local concept drift occurring in minority
classes. Extensive experimental study on multi-class drifting data streams,
enriched with a detailed analysis of the impact of local drifts and changing
imbalance ratios, confirms the high efficacy of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10228v1

cylindrical silo, with a bottom wall that rotates horizontally with respect to
the lateral wall \cite{Kiwing2019}. Here, we numerically reproduce their
experimental findings, in particular, the peculiar behavior of the mass flow
rate $Q$ as a function of the frequency of rotation $f$. Namely, we find that
for small outlet diameters $D$ the flow rate increased with $f$, while for
larger $D$ a non-monotonic behavior is confirmed. Furthermore, using a
coarse-graining technique, we compute the macroscopic density, momentum, and
the stress tensor fields. These results show conclusively that changes in the
discharge process are directly related to changes in the flow pattern from
funnel flow to mass flow. Moreover, by decomposing the mass flux (linear
momentum field) at the orifice into two main factors: macroscopic velocity and
density fields, we obtain that the non-monotonic behavior of the linear
momentum is caused by density changes rather than by changes in the macroscopic
velocity. In addition, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the kinetic
stress, we find that for small orifices increasing rotational shear enhances
the mean kinetic pressure $\langle p^k \rangle$ and the system dilatancy. This
reduces the stability of the arches, and, consequently, the volumetric flow
rate increases monotonically. For large orifices, however, we detected that
$\langle p^k \rangle$ changes non-monotonically, which might explain the
non-monotonic behavior of $Q$ when varying the rotational shear.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14201v1

quasi-periodic in nature, where regular transitions between two or more stable
emission states are seen. The durations of these states show a wide variety
ranging from several seconds to hours at a time. There are strong, small scale
magnetic field structures and huge temperature gradients present at the polar
cap surface. We have considered several processes that can cause temporal
modifications of the local magnetic field structure and strength at the surface
of the polar cap. Using different magnetic field strengths and scales, and also
assuming realistic scales of the temperature gradients, the evolutionary
timescales of different phenomena affecting the surface magnetic field was
estimated. We find that the Hall drift results in faster changes in comparison
to both Ohmic decay and thermoelectric effects. A mechanism based on the
Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model of the IAR has been proposed, where the Hall

Migrating Client Code without Change Examples,2021-05-06T01:37:51Z,"Hao Zhong, Na Meng","API developers evolve software libraries to fix bugs, add new features, or
refactor code. To benefit from such library evolution, the programmers of
client projects have to repetitively upgrade their library usages and adapt
their codebases to any library API breaking changes (e.g., API renaming). Such
adaptive changes can be tedious and error-prone. Existing tools provide limited
support to help programmers migrate client projects from old library versions
to new ones. For instance, some tools extract API mappings be-tween library
versions and only suggest simple adaptive changes (i.e., statement updates);
other tools suggest or automate more complicated edits (e.g., statement
insertions) based on user-provided exemplar code migrations. However, when new
library versions are available, it is usually cumbersome and time-consuming for
users to provide sufficient human-crafted samples in order to guide automatic
migration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, AutoUpdate, to further
improve the state of the art. Instead of learning from change examples, we
designed AutoUpdate to automate migration in a compiler-directed way. Namely,
given a compilation error triggered by upgrading libraries, AutoUpdate exploits
13 migration opera-tors to generate candidate edits, and tentatively applies
each edit until the error is resolved or all edits are explored. We conducted
two experiments. The first experiment involves migrating 371 tutorial examples
between versions of 5 popular libraries. AutoUpdate reduced migration-related
compilation errors for 92.7% of tasks. It eliminated such errors for 32.4% of

bounds on the number of samples of the reward distribution to detect the change
once it occurs. Consequently, we show that the proposed algorithm has
sub-linear regret. Contrary to existing works, our algorithm is able to detect
a change when the underlying reward distribution changes even though the mean
reward remains the same. Finally, to test the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm, we employ it in two case-studies: i) task-offloading scenario in
wireless edge-computing, and ii) portfolio optimization. Our results show that
the proposed TS-KS algorithm outperforms not only the static TS algorithm but

"DeepChange: A Large Long-Term Person Re-Identification Benchmark with
  Clothes Change",2021-05-31T03:35:00Z,"Peng Xu, Xiatian Zhu","Existing person re-identification (re-id) works mostly consider short-term
application scenarios without clothes change. In real-world, however, we often
dress differently across space and time. To solve this contrast, a few recent
attempts have been made on long-term re-id with clothes change. Currently, one
of the most significant limitations in this field is the lack of a large
realistic benchmark. In this work, we contribute a large, realistic long-term
person re-identification benchmark, named as DeepChange. It has several unique
characteristics: (1) Realistic and rich personal appearance (e.g., clothes and
hair style) and variations: Highly diverse clothes change and styles, with
varying reappearing gaps in time from minutes to seasons, different weather
conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, extremely cold) and
events (e.g., working, leisure, daily activities). (2) Rich camera setups: Raw
videos were recorded by 17 outdoor varying resolution cameras operating in a
real-world surveillance system. (3) The currently largest number of (17)
cameras, (1, 121) identities, and (178, 407) bounding boxes, over the longest
time span (12 months). Further, we investigate multimodal fusion strategies for
tackling the clothes change challenge. Extensive experiments show that our
fusion models outperform a wide variety of state-of-the-art models on

  Regression for Seasonal Data",2021-07-06T08:20:28Z,"Florian Haselbeck, Dominik G. Grimm","Time series forecasting is a growing domain with diverse applications.
However, changes of the system behavior over time due to internal or external
influences are challenging. Therefore, predictions of a previously learned
fore-casting model might not be useful anymore. In this paper, we present
EVent-triggered Augmented Refitting of Gaussian Process Regression for Seasonal
Data (EVARS-GPR), a novel online algorithm that is able to handle sudden shifts
in the target variable scale of seasonal data. For this purpose, EVARS-GPR
com-bines online change point detection with a refitting of the prediction
model using data augmentation for samples prior to a change point. Our
experiments on sim-ulated data show that EVARS-GPR is applicable for a wide
range of output scale changes. EVARS-GPR has on average a 20.8 % lower RMSE on
different real-world datasets compared to methods with a similar computational
resource con-sumption. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm leads to a
six-fold reduction of the averaged runtime in relation to all comparison
partners with a periodical refitting strategy. In summary, we present a
computationally efficient online fore-casting algorithm for seasonal time
series with changes of the target variable scale and demonstrate its
functionality on simulated as well as real-world data. All code is publicly

Acuna, Reuven Gordon, Michael Mayer","Many proteins undergo conformational changes during their activity. A full
understanding of the function of these proteins can only be obtained if
different conformations and transitions between them can be monitored in
aqueous solution, with adequate temporal resolution and, ideally, on a
single-molecule level. Interrogating conformational dynamics of single proteins
remains, however, exquisitely challenging and typically requires site-directed
chemical modification combined with rigorous minimization of possible
artifacts. These obstacles limit the number of single-protein investigations.
The work presented here introduces an approach that traps single unmodified
proteins from solution in a plasmonic hotspot and makes it possible to assign
changes in refractive index to changes in protein conformation while monitoring
these changes for minutes to hours with a temporal resolution at least as fast
as 40 microseconds. The resulting single molecule data reveals that adenylate
kinase employs a hidden enzymatic sub-cycle during catalysis, that citrate
synthase populates a previously unknown intermediate conformation, which is
more important for its enzymatic activity than its well-known open
conformation, that hemoglobin transitions in several steps from its
deoxygenated and rigid T state to its oxygenated and flexible R state, and that
apo-calmodulin thermally unfolds and refolds in steps that correspond to
conformational changes of individual protein domains.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06407v1
Spatiotemporal Characterization of VIIRS Night Light,2021-09-14T18:22:17Z,Christopher Small,"The VIIRS Day Night Band sensor on the Suomi NPP satellite provides almost a
decade of observations of night light. The daily frequency of sampling, without
the temporal averaging of annual composites, requires the distinction between
apparent changes of imaged night light related to the imaging process and
actual changes in the underlying sources of the light being imaged. This study
characterizes night light variability over a range of spatial and temporal
scales to provide a context for interpretation of changes on both subannual and
interannual time scales. This analysis uses a combination of temporal moments,
spatial correlation and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. A key
result is the pervasive heteroskedasticity of VIIRS monthly mean night light.
Specifically, the monotonic decrease of temporal variability with increasing
mean brightness. Anthropogenic night light is remarkably stable on subannual
time scales. Overall variance partition derived from the eigenvalues of the
spatiotemporal covariance matrix are 88%, 2% and 2% for spatial, seasonal and
interannual variance in the most diverse geographic region on Earth (Eurasia).
Heteroskedasticity is present in all areas for all months, suggesting that
much, if not most, of observed month-to-month variability may result from
luminance of otherwise stable sources subjected to multiple aspects of the
imaging process varying in time. Given the skewed distribution of all night
light arising from radial peripheral dimming of bright sources, even aggregate
metrics using thresholds must be interpreted in light of the fact that much
larger numbers of more variable low luminance pixels may statistically
overwhelm smaller numbers of stable higher luminance pixels and cause apparent
changes related to the imaging process to be interpreted as actual changes in
the light sources.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06913v1

institutions. We ask how social change occurs when behaviors and institutions
are interdependent. We model a group-structured society in which the
transmission of individual behavior occurs in parallel with the selection of
group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behavior that generates
collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its
own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behavior
within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in
proportion to their fitness. Finally, cooperative behavior may also spread
globally. As expected, we find that cooperation and institutions are mutually
reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioral source-sink dynamics when
cooperation generated in institutional groups spreads to non-institutional
groups, boosting their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of
cooperation creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the
evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a
group-structured society, large-scale change in behavior and institutions (i.e.
social change) can be best achieved when the two remain correlated, such as
through the spread successful pilot programs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08106v1

neuropsychological tool that has been designed to assess the severity of
cognitive symptoms of dementia. Personalized prediction of the changes in
ADAS-Cog scores could help in timing therapeutic interventions in dementia and
at-risk populations. In the present work, we compared single and multitask
learning approaches to predict the changes in ADAS-Cog scores based on
T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to most
machine learning-based prediction methods ADAS-Cog changes, we stratified the
subjects based on their baseline diagnoses and evaluated the prediction
performances in each group. Our experiments indicated a positive relationship
between the predicted and observed ADAS-Cog score changes in each diagnostic
group, suggesting that T1-weighted MRI has a predictive value for evaluating
cognitive decline in the entire AD continuum. We further studied whether
correction of the differences in the magnetic field strength of MRI would
improve the ADAS-Cog score prediction. The partial least square-based domain
adaptation slightly improved the prediction performance, but the improvement
was marginal. In summary, this study demonstrated that ADAS-Cog change could
be, to some extent, predicted based on anatomical MRI. Based on this study, the
recommended method for learning the predictive models is a single-task
regularized linear regression due to its simplicity and good performance. It
appears important to combine the training data across all subject groups for

  relative warning density and external software quality",2021-11-17T15:23:24Z,"Alexander Trautsch, Steffen Herbold, Jens Grabowski","Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) are part of software development best
practices. ASATs are able to warn developers about potential problems in the
code. On the one hand, ASATs are based on best practices so there should be a
noticeable effect on software quality. On the other hand, ASATs suffer from
false positive warnings, which developers have to inspect and then ignore or
mark as invalid. In this article, we ask the question if ASATs have a
measurable impact on external software quality, using the example of PMD for
Java. We investigate the relationship between ASAT warnings emitted by PMD on
defects per change and per file. Our case study includes data for the history
of each file as well as the differences between changed files and the project
in which they are contained. We investigate whether files that induce a defect
have more static analysis warnings than the rest of the project. Moreover, we
investigate the impact of two different sets of ASAT rules. We find that, bug
inducing files contain less static analysis warnings than other files of the
project at that point in time. However, this can be explained by the overall
decreasing warning density. When compared with all other changes, we find a
statistically significant difference in one metric for all rules and two
metrics for a subset of rules. However, the effect size is negligible in all
cases, showing that the actual difference in warning density between bug
inducing changes and other changes is small at best.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09188v2

pedestrians, are on the rise. To better inform design for vulnerable road
users, we need to conduct more studies to evaluate how bicyclist and pedestrian
behavior and physiological states change in different roadway designs and
contextual settings. Previous research highlights the advantages of Immersive
Virtual Environment (IVE) in conducting bicyclist and pedestrian studies. These
environments do not put participants at risk of getting injured, are low-cost
compared to on-road or naturalistic studies and allow researchers to fully
control variables of interest. In this paper, we propose a framework ORCLSim,
to support human sensing techniques within IVE to evaluate bicyclist and
pedestrian physiological and behavioral changes in different contextual
settings. To showcase this framework, we present two case studies where we
collect and analyze pilot data from five participants' physiological and
behavioral responses in an IVE setting, representing real-world roadway
segments and traffic conditions. Results from these case studies indicate that
physiological data is sensitive to road environment changes and real-time
events, especially changes in heart rate and gaze behavior. Additionally, our
preliminary data indicates participants may respond differently to various
roadway settings (e.g., intersections with or without traffic signal). By
analyzing these changes, we can identify how participants' stress levels and
cognitive load is impacted by the simulated surrounding environment. The
ORCLSim system architecture can be further utilized for future studies in
users' behavioral and physiological responses in different virtual reality
settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03420v1
IntelliTC: Automating Type Changes in IntelliJ IDEA,2021-12-07T10:31:42Z,"Oleg Smirnov, Ameya Ketkar, Timofey Bryksin, Nikolaos Tsantalis, Danny Dig","Developers often change types of program elements. Such refactoring often
involves updating not only the type of the element itself, but also the API of

time-consuming. Despite type changes being more frequent than renamings, just a
few current IDE tools provide partially-automated support only for a small set
of hard-coded types. Researchers have recently proposed a data-driven approach
to inferring API rewrite rules for type change patterns in Java using code

ingredients for complex catalysts used in heterogeneous catalysis. The gas
environment can change the catalyst during the reaction, modifying its
structural and electronic properties. Here, we use monochromated electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to reveal hydrogen-pressure-dependent changes
of the electronic structure at the Pd/rutile-TiO$_2$ interface in an
environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM). Hydrogen-induced changes
are observed in rutile-TiO$_2$ within $2$~nm from the interface at $10$~Pa of
hydrogen pressure, in the Ti $L_{3,2}$ EEL spectra. Lower pressures such as
$1$~Pa show no changes in the EEL spectra. We attribute the observed changes in
the EEL spectra to hydrogen-induced defects accumulating in the vicinity of the
interface. Based on DFT calculations, we developed a thermodynamic multistate
defect (TMD) model of the interface and the bulk of the rutile-TiO$_2$. This
TMD model predicts high concentrations of positively charged defects
accumulating at the interface. The presence of the Schottky barrier stabilizes
these defects by significantly lowering their formation energy. Our findings

Tracking Most Significant Arm Switches in Bandits,2021-12-27T18:59:05Z,"Joe Suk, Samory Kpotufe","In bandit with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically adapt to
unknown changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration when necessary.
While this problem has been studied for many years, a recent breakthrough of
Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provides the first adaptive procedure to guarantee an
optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, and an unknown number $L$
of changes. However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained
open whether faster rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes
in distribution are actually severe.
  To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of significant shift, which
only counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart: roughly,
these are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving
large aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure
adaptively achieves rates always faster (sometimes significantly) than
$O(\sqrt{ST})$, where $S\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same
time, always faster than the optimal $O(V^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ when
expressed in terms of total variation $V$ (which aggregates differences
overtime). Our results are expressed in enough generality to also capture
non-stochastic adversarial settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13838v6
"Watch out for Extrinsic Bugs! A Case Study of their Impact in
  Just-In-Time Bug Prediction Models on the OpenStack project",2021-03-28T17:37:34Z,"Gema Rodriguez-Perez, Meiyappan Nagappan, Gregorio Robles","Intrinsic bugs are bugs for which a bug introducing change can be identified
in the version control system of a software. In contrast, extrinsic bugs are
caused by external changes to a software, such as errors in external APIs;
thereby they do not have an explicit bug introducing change in the version
control system. Although most previous research literature has assumed that all
bugs are of intrinsic nature, in a previous study, we show that not all bugs
are intrinsic. This paper shows an example of how considering extrinsic bugs
can affect software engineering research. Specifically, we study the impact of
extrinsic bugs in Just In Time bug prediction by partially replicating a recent
study by McIntosh and Kamei on JIT models. These models are trained using
properties of earlier bug-introducing changes. Since extrinsic bugs do not have
bug introducing changes in the version control system, we manually curate
McIntosh and Kamei's dataset to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic
bugs. Then, we address their original research questions, this time removing
extrinsic bugs, to study whether bug-introducing changes are a moving target in
Just-In-Time bug prediction. Finally, we study whether characteristics of
intrinsic and extrinsic bugs are different. Our results show that intrinsic and
extrinsic bugs are of different nature. When removing extrinsic bugs the
performance is different up to 16 % Area Under the Curve points. This indicates
that our JIT models obtain a more accurate representation of the real world. We
conclude that extrinsic bugs negatively impact Just-In-Time models.
Furthermore, we offer evidence that extrinsic bugs should be further
investigated, as they can significantly impact how software engineers
understand bugs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15180v1

fixes, security patches, and refactorings. However, when a library evolves, it
may break the contract previously established with its clients by introducing
Breaking Changes (BCs) in its API. These changes might trigger compile-time,
link-time, or run-time errors in client code. As a result, clients may hesitate
to upgrade their dependencies, raising security concerns and making future
upgrades even more difficult.Understanding how libraries evolve helps client
developers to know which changes to expect and where to expect them, and
library developers to understand how they might impact their clients. In the
most extensive study to date, Raemaekers et al. investigate to what extent
developers of Java libraries hosted on the Maven Central Repository (MCR)
follow semantic versioning conventions to signal the introduction of BCs and
how these changes impact client projects. Their results suggest that BCs are
widespread without regard for semantic versioning, with a significant impact on
clients.In this paper, we conduct an external and differentiated replication
study of their work. We identify and address some limitations of the original
protocol and expand the analysis to a new corpus spanning seven more years of
the MCR. We also present a novel static analysis tool for Java bytecode,
Maracas, which provides us with: (i) the set of all BCs between two versions of
a library; and (ii) the set of locations in client code impacted by individual
BCs. Our key findings, derived from the analysis of 119, 879 library upgrades
and 293, 817 clients, contrast with the original study and show that 83.4% of
these upgrades do comply with semantic versioning. Furthermore, we observe that
the tendency to comply with semantic versioning has significantly increased
over time. Finally, we find that most BCs affect code that is not used by any
client, and that only 7.9% of all clients are affected by BCs. These findings
should help (i) library developers to understand and anticipate the impact of
their changes; (ii) library users to estimate library upgrading effort and to
pick libraries that are less likely to break; and (iii) researchers to better
understand the dynamics of library-client co-evolution in Java.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07889v1

material properties, such as changing the topology of the band structure.
Unfortunately, the weakness of van der Waals interactions makes it difficult to
compute the stacking dependence of properties, and even in a material as simple
as graphite the stacking energetics remain unclear. Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$
is a material in which three differently-stacked phases are conveniently
accessible by temperature changes: $1T^{\prime}$, $T^*_d$, and the reported
Weyl semimetal phase $T_d$. The transitions proceed via layer sliding, and the
corresponding interlayer shear mode (ISM) is relevant not just for the stacking
energetics, but for understanding the relationship between the Weyl physics and
structural changes. However, the interlayer interactions of
Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ are not well understood, with wide variation in
computed properties. We report inelastic neutron scattering of the ISM in a
Mo$_{0.91}$W$_{0.09}$Te$_{2}$ crystal. The ISM energies are generally
consistent with the linear chain model (LCM), as expected given the weak
interlayer interaction, though there are some discrepancies from predicted
intensities. However, the interlayer force constants $K_x$ in the $T^*_d$ and
$1T^{\prime}$ phases are substantially weaker than that of $T_d$, at 76(3)% and
83(3)%, respectively. Considering that the relative positioning of atoms in
neighboring layers is approximately the same regardless of overall stacking,
our results suggest that longer-range influences, such as stacking-induced band
structure changes, may be responsible for the substantial change in the
interlayer vibrational coupling. These findings should elucidate the stacking
energetics of Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ and other van der Waals layered

though infected, Tested positive, and Removed Analysis) that takes into account
both of these two key properties. While applying the model to a region, two
parameters of the model can be learnt from the number of daily new cases found
in the region. Using the learnt values of the parameters the model can predict
the number of daily new cases so long as the learnt parameters do not change
substantially. Whenever any of the two parameters changes due to the key
property (ii) above, the SUTRA model can detect that the values of one or both

the data of daily new cases are available.
  We have applied the SUTRA model to thirty-two countries, covering more than

capture the past trajectories very well. Moreover, the parameter values, which

characteristics. (ii) Unless the pandemic characteristics change significantly,
the model has good predictive capability. (iii) Natural immunity provides
significantly better protection against infection than the currently available

developed to study thermo-gas-liquid-solid flows with liquid-solid phase

conditions and exactly reduces to the consistent and conservative Phase-Field
method for incompressible two-phase flows, the fictitious domain Brinkman
penalization (FD/BP) method for fluid-structure interactions, and the
Phase-Field model of solidification of pure material. It honors the mass
conservation, defines the volume fractions of individual phases unambiguously,
and therefore captures the volume change due to phase change. The momentum is
conserved when the solid phase is absent, but it changes when the solid phase
appears due to the no-slip condition at the solid boundary. The proposed model
also conserves the energy, preserves the temperature equilibrium, and is
Galilean invariant. A novel continuous surface tension force to confine its
contribution at the gas-liquid interface and a drag force modified from the
Carman-Kozeny equation to reduce solid velocity to zero are proposed. The issue
of initiating phase change in the original Phase-Field model of solidification
is addressed by physically modifying the interpolation function. The
corresponding consistent scheme is developed to solve the model, and the

  Deep Reinforcement Learning and Change Point Detection",2021-04-01T02:14:01Z,"Marina Haliem, Vaneet Aggarwal, Bharat Bhargava","This paper introduces an adaptive model-free deep reinforcement approach that
can recognize and adapt to the diurnal patterns in the ride-sharing environment
with car-pooling. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from catastrophic
forgetting due to being agnostic to the timescale of changes in the
distribution of experiences. Although RL algorithms are guaranteed to converge
to optimal policies in Markov decision processes (MDPs), this only holds in the
presence of static environments. However, this assumption is very restrictive.
In many real-world problems like ride-sharing, traffic control, etc., we are
dealing with highly dynamic environments, where RL methods yield only
sub-optimal decisions. To mitigate this problem in highly dynamic environments,
we (1) adopt an online Dirichlet change point detection (ODCP) algorithm to
detect the changes in the distribution of experiences, (2) develop a Deep Q
Network (DQN) agent that is capable of recognizing diurnal patterns and making
informed dispatching decisions according to the changes in the underlying
environment. Rather than fixing patterns by time of week, the proposed approach
automatically detects that the MDP has changed, and uses the results of the new
model. In addition to the adaptation logic in dispatching, this paper also
proposes a dynamic, demand-aware vehicle-passenger matching and route planning
framework that dynamically generates optimal routes for each vehicle based on
online demand, vehicle capacities, and locations. Evaluation on New York City

fleet utilization, where less than 50% of the fleet are utilized to serve the

A Statistical Model of Word Rank Evolution,2021-07-21T08:57:32Z,"Alex John Quijano, Rick Dale, Suzanne Sindi","The availability of large linguistic data sets enables data-driven approaches
to study linguistic change. The Google Books corpus unigram frequency data set
is used to investigate the word rank dynamics in eight languages. We observed
the rank changes of the unigrams from 1900 to 2008 and compared it to a
Wright-Fisher inspired model that we developed for our analysis. The model
simulates a neutral evolutionary process with the restriction of having no
disappearing and added words. This work explains the mathematical framework of
the model - written as a Markov Chain with multinomial transition probabilities
- to show how frequencies of words change in time. From our observations in the
data and our model, word rank stability shows two types of characteristics: (1)
the increase/decrease in ranks are monotonic, or (2) the rank stays the same.
Based on our model, high-ranked words tend to be more stable while low-ranked
words tend to be more volatile. Some words change in ranks in two ways: (a) by
an accumulation of small increasing/decreasing rank changes in time and (b) by
shocks of increase/decrease in ranks. Most words in all of the languages we
have looked at are rank stable, but not as stable as a neutral model would
predict. The stopwords and Swadesh words are observed to be rank stable across
eight languages indicating linguistic conformity in established languages.
These signatures suggest unigram frequencies in all languages have changed in a
manner inconsistent with a purely neutral evolutionary process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09948v4

the model to increase our data set to 125,482 commits. Based on the resulting
data set, we investigate the differences in size and 14 static source code
metrics between changes that increase quality, as indicated by the developer,
and other changes. We find that quality improving commits are smaller than
other commits. Perfective changes have a positive impact on static source code
metrics while corrective changes do tend to add complexity. Furthermore, we
find that files which are the target of perfective maintenance already have a
lower median complexity than other files. Our study results provide empirical
evidence for which static source code metrics capture quality improvement from
the developers point of view. This has implications for program understanding

This includes achieving chaos by changing the detuning, coupling parameters,
and Power of the driving laser. This allows us to manipulate chaos using either
the qubit or the optical cavity. Chaotic motion was also observed in both the
qubit and cavity by only changing the relative phase between of driving fields

Analysis of Language Change in Collaborative Instruction Following,2021-09-09T17:51:59Z,"Anna Effenberger, Eva Yan, Rhia Singh, Alane Suhr, Yoav Artzi","We analyze language change over time in a collaborative, goal-oriented
instructional task, where utility-maximizing participants form conventions and

Spin Berry points as crucial for ultrafast demagnetization,2021-02-26T20:16:33Z,"G. P. Zhang, Y. H. Bai, Thomas F. George","Laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization has puzzled researchers around the
world for over two decades. Intrinsic complexity in electronic, magnetic, and
phononic subsystems is difficult to understand microscopically. So far it is
not possible to explain demagnetization using a single mechanism, which
suggests a crucial piece of information still missing. In this paper, we return
to a fundamental aspect of physics: spin and its change within each band in the
entire Brillouin zone. We employ fcc Ni as an example and use an extremely
dense {\bf k} mesh to map out spin changes for every band close to the Fermi
level along all the high symmetry lines. To our surprise, spin angular momentum
at some special {\bf k} points abruptly changes from $\pm \hbar/2$ to $\mp
\hbar/2$ simply by moving from one crystal momentum point to the next. This
explains why intraband transitions, which the spin superdiffusion model is
based upon, can induce a sharp spin moment reduction, and why electric current
can change spin orientation in spintronics. These special {\bf k} points, which
are called spin Berry points, are not random and appear when several bands are
close to each other, so the Berry potential of spin majority states is
different from that of spin minority states. Although within a single band,
spin Berry points jump, when we group several neighboring bands together, they
form distinctive smooth spin Berry lines. It is the band structure that
disrupts those lines. Spin Berry points are crucial to laser-induced ultrafast
demagnetization and spintronics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00040v1

Fields of History such as Public and Oral History have particularly benefitted

Evaluating Robustness of Counterfactual Explanations,2021-03-03T12:16:06Z,"AndrÃ© Artelt, Valerie Vaquet, Riza Velioglu, Fabian Hinder, Johannes Brinkrolf, Malte Schilling, Barbara Hammer","Transparency is a fundamental requirement for decision making systems when
these should be deployed in the real world. It is usually achieved by providing
explanations of the system's behavior. A prominent and intuitive type of
explanations are counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations
explain a behavior to the user by proposing actions -- as changes to the input
-- that would cause a different (specified) behavior of the system. However,
such explanation methods can be unstable with respect to small changes to the
input -- i.e. even a small change in the input can lead to huge or arbitrary
changes in the output and of the explanation. This could be problematic for
counterfactual explanations, as two similar individuals might get very
different explanations. Even worse, if the recommended actions differ
considerably in their complexity, one would consider such unstable
(counterfactual) explanations as individually unfair.
  In this work, we formally and empirically study the robustness of
counterfactual explanations in general, as well as under different models and
different kinds of perturbations. Furthermore, we propose that plausible
counterfactual explanations can be used instead of closest counterfactual
explanations to improve the robustness and consequently the individual fairness

tools also differ dramatically in terms of the set of problematic files they
identify, since each implements its own definitions of ""problematic"". After
normalizing by size, the most problematic file sets that the tools identify
barely overlap. 3) Our results show that code-based measures, other than size
and complexity, do not even moderately correlate with a file's change-proneness
or error-proneness. In contrast, co-change-related measures performed better.
Our results suggest that, to identify files with true technical debt -- those
that experience excessive changes or bugs -- co-change information must be
considered. Code-based measures are largely ineffective at pinpointing true
debt. Finally, this study reveals the need for the community to create
benchmarks and data sets to assess the accuracy of software analysis tools in
terms of commonly used measures.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04506v1
Geometric Change Detection in Digital Twins using 3D Machine Learning,2021-03-15T08:20:16Z,"Tiril Sundby, Julia Maria Graham, Adil Rasheed, Mandar Tabib, Omer San","Digital twins are meant to bridge the gap between real-world physical systems
and virtual representations. Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins
incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the physical representations of
objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required to
rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical
counterpart. Due to an essential need for having high-quality geometric models
for accurate physical representations, the storage and bandwidth requirements
for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the available storage and
bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric
change detection in the context of a digital twin. We address the issue through
a combined solution of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for motion detection,
YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine learning for pose estimation. DMD
is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of moving foreground
objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted
and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection
algorithm YOLOv5 is applied to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects
in the video frames. Furthermore, the rotational pose of each object is
estimated in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural
networks conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the
network outputs the estimated Euler angles of the camera orientation with
respect to the object in the input image. By only storing data associated with
a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and bandwidth
requirements while still being able to recreate the 3D scene on demand.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08201v1

pipelines work well until variations in viewpoint and appearance change become
extreme. Past research in this area has typically focused on one of two
approaches to this challenge: the use of projections into spaces more suitable
for feature matching under extreme viewpoint changes, and attempting to learn
features that are inherently more robust to viewpoint change. In this paper, we
present a novel framework that combines learning of invariant descriptors
through data augmentation and orthographic viewpoint projection. We propose
rotation-robust local descriptors, learnt through training data augmentation
based on rotation homographies, and a correspondence ensemble technique that
combines vanilla feature correspondences with those obtained through
rotation-robust features. Using a range of benchmark datasets as well as
contributing a new bespoke dataset for this research domain, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on key tasks including pose estimation

candidate for storage-class non-volatile memory and neuro-inspired computing.
Recently, using the $TiTe_2$/$Sb_2Te_3$ material combination, a new framework -
phase-change heterostructure (PCH), has been developed and proved to
effectively suppress the noise and drift in electrical resistance upon memory
programming, largely reducing the inter-device variability. However, the
atomic-scale structural and chemical nature of PCH remains to be fully
understood. In this work, we carry out thorough ab initio simulations to assess
the bonding characteristics of the PCH. We show that the $TiTe_2$ crystalline
nanolayers do not chemically interact with the surrounding $Sb_2Te_3$, and are
stabilized by strong covalent and electrostatic Ti-Te interactions, which
create a prohibitively high barrier for atomic migrations along the pulsing
direction. We also find significant contrast in computed dielectric functions
in the PCH, suggesting possible optical applications of this class of devices.
With the more confined space and therefore constrained phase transition

devices may lead to improvements in phase-change photonic and optoelectronic
applications with much lower stochasticity during programming.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13583v2
"What happens when a journal converts to Open Access? A bibliometric
  analysis",2021-03-26T15:20:29Z,"Fakhri Momeni, Philipp Mayr, Nicholas Fraser, Isabella Peters","In recent years, increased stakeholder pressure to transition research to
Open Access has led to many journals converting, or 'flipping', from a closed
access (CA) to an open access (OA) publishing model. Changing the publishing
model can influence the decision of authors to submit their papers to a
journal, and increased article accessibility may influence citation behaviour.
In this paper we aimed to understand how flipping a journal to an OA model
influences the journal's future publication volumes and citation impact. We
analysed two independent sets of journals that had flipped to an OA model, one
from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and one from the Open Access
Directory (OAD), and compared their development with two respective control
groups of similar journals. For bibliometric analyses, journals were matched to
the Scopus database. We assessed changes in the number of articles published
over time, as well as two citation metrics at the journal and article level:
the normalised impact factor (IF) and the average relative citations (ARC),
respectively. Our results show that overall, journals that flipped to an OA
model increased their publication output compared to journals that remained
closed. Mean normalised IF and ARC also generally increased following the flip
to an OA model, at a greater rate than was observed in the control groups.
However, the changes appear to vary largely by scientific discipline. Overall,
these results indicate that flipping to an OA publishing model can bring
positive changes to a journal.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14522v1

show the same static (dc) response but distinct dynamical (ac) response. In
particular, the ac anomalous Hall conductivity profile $\sigma_{yx}(\omega)$ is
sensitive to the band shape of QAH states. For example, dispersive QAH bands
shows resonance profile without a sign change at the band gap while the IQH
states shows the sign change resonance at the cyclotron energy. We argue by
flattening the dispersive QAH bands, $\sigma_{yx}(\omega)$ should recover to
that of flat Landau bands in IQH, thus it is necessary to know the origin of
the sign change. Taking a topological lattice model with tunable bandwidth, we
found that the origin of the sign change is not the band gap but the Van Hove
singularity energy of the QAH bands. In the limit of small bandwidth, the flat
QAH bands recovers $\sigma_{yx}(\omega)$ of the IQH Landau bands. Because of
the Hall response, these topological bands exhibit giant polarization rotation
and ellipticity in the reflected waves (Kerr effect) and rotation in the order

Controllable Gradient Item Retrieval,2021-05-31T19:07:17Z,"Haonan Wang, Chang Zhou, Carl Yang, Hongxia Yang, Jingrui He","In this paper, we identify and study an important problem of gradient item
retrieval. We define the problem as retrieving a sequence of items with a
gradual change on a certain attribute, given a reference item and a
modification text. For example, after a customer saw a white dress, she/he
wants to buy a similar one but more floral on it. The extent of ""more floral""
is subjective, thus prompting one floral dress is hard to satisfy the
customer's needs. A better way is to present a sequence of products with
increasingly floral attributes based on the white dress, and allow the customer
to select the most satisfactory one from the sequence. Existing item retrieval
methods mainly focus on whether the target items appear at the top of the
retrieved sequence, but ignore the demand for retrieving a sequence of products
with gradual change on a certain attribute. To deal with this problem, we
propose a weakly-supervised method that can learn a disentangled item
representation from user-item interaction data and ground the semantic meaning
of attributes to dimensions of the item representation. Our method takes a
reference item and a modification as a query. During inference, we start from
the reference item and ""walk"" along the direction of the modification in the
item representation space to retrieve a sequence of items in a gradient manner.
We demonstrate our proposed method can achieve disentanglement through weak
supervision. Besides, we empirically show that an item sequence retrieved by
our method is gradually changed on an indicated attribute and, in the item
retrieval task, our method outperforms existing approaches on three different
datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00062v1

densities were estimated in 113 pulsars at two frequencies of 325 and 610 MHz

each pulsar were calibrated using the estimated flux density. We have used the
flux calibrated average profile to study the variation of the spectral index
across the emission beam in 21 pulsars where the core, inner cone and the outer
conal components could be clearly identified. The central core component showed
a steeper increase in emission at the lower frequency compared with conal
emission, with an average difference in spectral index
$\delta\alpha_{core-cone}\sim-0.7$ between the core and the conal components in
this frequency range. In contrast the inner conal components had positive
difference in their spectral index compared to the outer cones with average
difference $\delta\alpha_{in-out}\sim+0.3$. The variation in the spectral index
across the pulse window should provide valuable inputs for constraining the
radio emission processes. The single pulse emission showed the presence of
emission mode changing in 12 pulsars with 3 cases where the phenomenon is being
reported for the first time. In addition we have also detected enhanced
emission for short durations or flaring, in parts or across the entire emission
window in 14 pulsars. The sudden changes in the emission during mode changing

"FlexParser -- the adaptive log file parser for continuous results in a
  changing world",2021-06-06T16:30:01Z,"Nadine Ruecker, Andreas Maier","Any modern system writes events into files, called log files. Those contain
crucial information which are subject to various analyses. Examples range from

Before data analysis is possible, desired information needs to be extracted

often assumes static log events. However, any modern system is updated
consistently and with updates also log file structures can change. We call
those changes ""mutation"" and study parsing performance for different mutation
cases. Latest research discovers mutations using anomaly detection post mortem,

flexible parser, called FlexParser, which can extract desired values despite
gradual changes in the log messages. It implies basic text preprocessing
followed by a supervised Deep Learning method. We train a stateful LSTM on
parsing one event per data set. Statefulness enforces the model to learn log
message structures across several examples. Our model was tested on seven

Learning methods as well as state-of-the-art unsupervised parsers.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03170v2
"A Nonlinear Observability Analysis of Ambient Wind Estimation with
  Uncalibrated Sensors, Inspired by Insect Neural Encoding",2021-06-07T21:35:25Z,Floris van Breugel,"Estimating the direction of ambient fluid flow is key for many flying or
swimming animals and robots, but can only be accomplished through indirect
measurements and active control. Recent work with tethered flying insects
indicates that their sensory representation of orientation, apparent flow,
direction of movement, and control is represented by a 2-dimensional angular
encoding in the central brain. This representation simplifies sensory
integration by projecting the direction (but not scale) of measurements with
different units onto a universal polar coordinate frame. To align these angular
measurements with one another and the motor system does, however, require a
calibration of angular gain and offset for each sensor. This calibration could
change with time due to changes in the environment or physical structure. The
circumstances under which small robots and animals with angular sensors and
changing calibrations could self-calibrate and estimate the direction of
ambient fluid flow while moving remains an open question. Here, a methodical
nonlinear observability analysis is presented to address this. The analysis
shows that it is mathematically feasible to continuously estimate flow
direction and perform regular self-calibrations by adopting frequent changes in
course (or active prevention thereof) and orientation, and requires fusion and
temporal differentiation of three sensory measurements: apparent flow,
orientation (or its derivative), and direction of motion (or its derivative).
These conclusions are consistent with the zigzagging trajectories exhibited by
many plume tracking organisms, suggesting that perhaps flow estimation is a
secondary driver of their trajectory structure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03974v1

generated with a circularly polarized laser beam, must have the ability to
switch quickly between right and left helicity polarization states. The
polarized source must also maintain minimal right-left helicity correlated beam
asymmetries, including energy changes, position changes, intensity changes, or
spot-size changes. These requirements can be met with appropriate choice and
design of the Pockels cell used to generate the circularly polarized light.

time series. If these events reflect real changes in electron column density,
they should lead to multiple imaging. We show that the events are are well
fitted by an underdense corrugated sheet model, and look for associated

that there are transient pulse profile variations, but they vary in concert
with the dispersion measure, unlike what is expected from lensing due to a

the Greenbank and Arecibo radio observatories, and its amplitude appears to be
achromatic across the 820-MHz, 1.4-GHz, and 2.3-GHz bands, again unlike
expected from interference between lensed images. This result is puzzling. We
note that some of the predicted lensing effects would need higher time and

the incoming changes with all past commits in the project, considering both
those that introduced defects and those that did not. Our method considers
individual changes in the commit separately, at the method-level granularity.
Doing so helps developers as they are informed of specific methods that need
further attention instead of being told that the entire commit is problematic.
Our approach represents source code as abstract syntax trees and uses tree
kernels to estimate the similarity of the code with previous commits. We
experiment with subtree kernels (STK), subset tree kernels (SSTK), or partial
tree kernels (PTK). An incoming change is then classified using a K-NN
classifier on the past changes. We evaluate our approach on the BigCloneBench
benchmark and on the Technical Debt dataset, using the NiCad clone detector as
the baseline. Our experiments with the BigCloneBench benchmark show that the
tree kernel approach can detect clones with a comparable MAP to that of NiCad.

records available. A changepoint analysis is performed to detect abrupt
changes, which can be regarded as a preliminary step before further analysis is
conducted to identify the causes of the changes (e.g., artificial,
human-induced or natural variability). Regression models with structural
breaks, including mean and trend shifts, are fitted to the series and compared
via two commonly used multiple changepoint penalized likelihood criteria that
balance model fit quality (as measured by likelihood) against parsimony
considerations. Our changepoint model fits, with independent and short-memory
errors, are also compared with a different class of models termed long-memory
models that have been previously used by other authors to describe persistence
features in temperature series. In the end, the optimal model is judged to be
one containing a changepoint in the late 1980s, with a transition to an
intensified warming regime. This timing and warming conclusion is consistent
across changepoint models compared in this analysis. The variability of the
series is not found to be significantly changing, and shift features are judged
to be more plausible than either short- or long-memory autocorrelations. The
final proposed model is one including trend-shifts (both intercept and slope
parameters) with independent errors. The analysis serves as a walk-through

Conservation with moving meshes over orography,2021-08-02T12:21:10Z,"Hiroe Yamazaki, Hilary Weller, Colin J. Cotter, Philip A. Browne","Adaptive meshes have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
atmospheric modelling by increasing resolution where it is most needed. Mesh
re-distribution, or r-adaptivity, adapts by moving the mesh without changing
the connectivity. This avoids some of the challenges with h-adaptivity (adding
and removing points): the solution does not need to be mapped between meshes,
which can be expensive and introduces errors, and there are no load balancing
problems on parallel computers. A long standing problem with both forms of
adaptivity has been changes in volume of the domain as resolution changes at an
uneven boundary. We propose a solution to exact local conservation and
maintenance of uniform fields while the mesh changes volume as it moves over
orography. This is solved by introducing a volume adjustment parameter which
tracks the true cell volumes without using expensive conservative mapping.
  A finite volume solution of the advection equation over orography on moving
meshes is described and results are presented demonstrating improved accuracy
for cost using moving meshes. Exact local conservation and maintenance of
uniform fields is demonstrated and the corrected mesh volume is preserved.
  We use optimal transport to generate meshes which are guaranteed not to
tangle and are equidistributed with respect to a monitor function. This leads
to a Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation which is solved with a Newton solver. The
superiority of the Newton solver over other techniques is demonstrated in the

Droplets on substrates with oscillating wettability,2021-08-03T12:01:48Z,"Josua Grawitter, Holger Stark","In recent decades novel solid substrates have been designed which change
their wettability in response to light or an electrostatic field. Here, we
investigate a droplet on substrates with oscillating uniform wettability by
varying minimium and maximum contact angles and frequency. To simulate this
situation, we use our previous work [Grawitter and Stark, Soft Matter 17, 2454
(2021)], where we implemented the boundary element method in combination with
the Cox-Voinov law for the contact-line velocity, to determine the fluid flow
inside a droplet. After a transient regime the droplet performs steady
oscillations, the amplitude of which decreases with increasing frequency. For
slow oscillations our numerical results agree well with the linearized
spherical-cap model. They collapse on a master curve when we rescale frequency
by a characteristic relaxation time. In contrast, for fast oscillations we
observe significant deviations from the master curve. The decay of the
susceptibility is weaker and the phase shift between oscillations in
wettability and contact angle stays below the predicted $\pi/2$. The reason
becomes obvious when studying the combined dynamics of droplet height and
contact angle. It reveals non-reciprocal shape changes during one oscillation
period even at low frequencies due to the induced fluid flow inside the
droplet, which are not captured by the spherical-cap model. Similar periodic
non-reciprocal shape changes occur at low frequencies when the droplet is
placed on an oscillating nonuniform wettability profile with six-fold symmetry.
Such profiles are inspired by the light intensity pattern of Laguerre-Gauss
laser modes. Since the non-reciprocal shape changes induce fluid circulation,
which is controllable from the outside, our findings envisage to design
targeted microfluidic transport of solutes inside the droplet.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01429v1

  Density-functional Fluctuation Theory",2021-08-05T21:20:55Z,"Yunus A. Kinkhabwala, Boris Barron, Matthew Hall, Tomas A. Arias, Itai Cohen","Racial residential segregation is a defining and enduring feature of U.S.
society, shaping inter-group relations, racial disparities in income and
health, and access to high-quality public goods and services. The design of
policies aimed at addressing these inequities would be better informed by
descriptive models of segregation that are able to predict neighborhood scale
racial sorting dynamics. While coarse regional population projections are
widely accessible, small area population changes remain challenging to predict
because granular data on migration is limited and mobility behaviors are driven
by complex social and idiosyncratic dynamics. Consequently, to account for such
drivers, it is necessary to develop methods that can extract effective
descriptions of their impacts on population dynamics based solely on
statistical analysis of available data. Here, we develop and validate a
Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (DFFT) that quantifies segregation using
density-dependent functions extracted from population counts and uses these
functions to accurately forecast how the racial/ethnic compositions of
neighborhoods across the US are likely to change. Importantly, DFFT makes
minimal assumptions about the nature of the underlying causes of segregation
and is designed to quantify segregation for neighborhoods with different total
populations in regions with different compositions. This quantification can be
used to accurately forecast both average changes in neighborhood compositions
and the likelihood of more drastic changes such as those associated with
gentrification and neighborhood tipping. As such, DFFT provides a powerful
framework for researchers and policy makers alike to better quantify and
forecast neighborhood-scale segregation and its associated dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04084v1
"Recognizing and prevention of probable regime shift in density regulated
  and Allee type stochastic harvesting model with application to herring
  conservation",2021-08-17T09:37:31Z,"Anurag Sau, Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, Bapi Saha","An ecological system with multiple stable equilibria is prone to undergo
catastrophic change or regime shift from one steady-state to another. It should
be noted that, if one of the steady states is an extinction state, the
catastrophic change may lead to extinction. A suitable manual measure may
control the prevention of catastrophic changes of different species from one
equilibrium to another. We consider two stochastic models with linear and
nonlinear harvesting terms. We inspect either density regulation or Allee type
density regulated models [Saha et al., Ecological Modelling, 2013], which have
substantial applications in the herring fish population's viability study. Both
the deterministic models we consider here contain bi-stability under certain
restrictions, and in that case, one of the stable states is the extinction
state. We assume that the dynamical system under consideration is closed, i.e.,
immigration and emigration are absent. The demographic noise is introduced in
the system by substituting an ordinary differential equation with a stochastic
differential equation model, where the birth and death rates of the
deterministic process are used to obtain the instantaneous mean and variance in
the stochastic differential equation. Our study reveals that, the catastrophic
changes can be avoided manually by a suitable choice of handling time that will
eventually help to prevent the sudden extinction of the harvested population.
The entire study is illustrated through the herring population size data

  towards Robust Imaging through Dynamic Scattering Media",2021-08-18T19:42:14Z,"Xiaowen Hu, Jian Zhao, Jose Enrique Antonio-Lopez, Stefan Gausmann, Rodrigo Amezcua Correa, Axel Schulzgen","Imaging through scattering media is a useful and yet demanding task since it
involves solving for an inverse mapping from speckle images to object images.
It becomes even more challenging when the scattering medium undergoes dynamic
changes. Various approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, to
date, none is able to preserve high image quality without either assuming a
finite number of sources for dynamic changes, assuming a thin scattering
medium, or requiring the access to both ends of the medium. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive inverse mapping (AIP) method which is flexible regarding
any dynamic change and only requires output speckle images after
initialization. We show that the inverse mapping can be corrected through
unsupervised learning if the output speckle images are followed closely. We
test the AIP method on two numerical simulations, namely, a dynamic scattering
system formulated as an evolving transmission matrix and a telescope with a
changing random phase mask at a defocus plane. Then we experimentally apply the
AIP method on a dynamic fiber-optic imaging system. Increased robustness in
imaging is observed in all three cases. With the excellent performance, we see
the great potential of the AIP method in imaging through dynamic scattering

  Changes of Susceptibility to Persuasion",2021-08-22T22:58:15Z,"Naoki Marumo, Atsushi Miyauchi, Akiko Takeda, Akira Tanaka","Many social phenomena are triggered by public opinion that is formed in the
process of opinion exchange among individuals. To date, from the engineering
point of view, a large body of work has been devoted to studying how to
manipulate individual opinions so as to guide public opinion towards the
desired state. Recently, Abebe et al. (KDD 2018) have initiated the study of
the impact of interventions at the level of susceptibility rather than the
interventions that directly modify individual opinions themselves. For the
model, Chan et al. (The Web Conference 2019) designed a local search algorithm
to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. However, it can be seen that
the solution obtained by solving the above model might not be implemented in
real-world scenarios. In fact, as we do not consider the amount of changes of
the susceptibility, it would be too costly to change the susceptibility values
for agents based on the solution.
  In this paper, we study an opinion optimization model that is able to limit
the amount of changes of the susceptibility in various forms. First we
introduce a novel opinion optimization model, where the initial susceptibility
values are given as additional input and the feasible region is defined using
the $\ell_p$-ball centered at the initial susceptibility vector. For the
proposed model, we design a projected gradient method that is applicable to the

mind-changing (turnback) scenario, the performance of DST models significantly
degenerated. However, we found that this performance degeneration can be
recovered when the turnback scenarios are explicitly designed in the training

evidenced that the smaller cations Mn2+ and Mn3+ will not occupy the A-site of
a perovskite under atmospheric synthesis conditions. The same analysis also
supports that the vacancy in the A-site of a perovskite induces a similar
vacancy in the B-site. The La3+ and Sr2+ cation substitutions in the A-site

inversely, which is explained in terms of the electronic bandwidth change. An
anomalous non-linear change of the GP has been observed in the Sr-substituted
compounds. The agglomeration of Mn3+-Mn4+ pairs (denoted as dimerons), into
small ferromagnetic clusters, has been identified as the reason for the
occurrence of the GP. A threshold limit of the dimeron formation explains the
observed non-linear behaviour of the GP formation. The Sr-substituted compounds
show a relatively large value of isothermal entropy change (maximum 3.27 J/kgK

A Broad Ensemble Learning System for Drifting Stream Classification,2021-10-07T15:01:33Z,"Sepehr Bakhshi, Pouya Ghahramanian, Hamed Bonab, Fazli Can","In a data stream environment, classification models must handle concept drift
efficiently and effectively. Ensemble methods are widely used for this purpose;
however, the ones available in the literature either use a large data chunk to
update the model or learn the data one by one. In the former, the model may
miss the changes in the data distribution, and in the latter, the model may
suffer from inefficiency and instability. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel ensemble approach based on the Broad Learning System (BLS), where mini
chunks are used at each update. BLS is an effective lightweight neural
architecture recently developed for incremental learning. Although it is fast,
it requires huge data chunks for effective updates, and is unable to handle
dynamic changes observed in data streams. Our proposed approach named Broad
Ensemble Learning System (BELS) uses a novel updating method that significantly
improves best-in-class model accuracy. It employs an ensemble of output layers
to address the limitations of BLS and handle drifts. Our model tracks the
changes in the accuracy of the ensemble components and react to these changes.
We present the mathematical derivation of BELS, perform comprehensive
experiments with 20 datasets that demonstrate the adaptability of our model to
various drift types, and provide hyperparameter and ablation analysis of our

environmental changes particularly marked in Europe and coincides with a
dramatic biotic turnover. Here, using an exceptional fossil preservation, we
document and analyse the diversity dynamics of a mammal clade, Cainotherioidea
(Artiodactyla), that survived the EOT and radiated rapidly immediately after.
We infer their diversification history from Quercy Konzentrat--Lagerst{\""a}tte
(south-west France) at the species level using Bayesian birth--death models. We
show that cainotherioid diversity fluctuated through time, with extinction
events at the EOT and in the late Oligocene, and a major speciation burst in
the early Oligocene. The latter is in line with our finding that cainotherioids
had a high morphological adaptability following environmental changes
throughout the EOT, which probably played a key role in the survival and
evolutionary success of this clade in the aftermath. Speciation is positively
associated with temperature and continental fragmentation in a time-continuous
way, while extinction seems to synchronize with environmental change in a
punctuated way. Within-clade interactions negatively affected the cainotherioid
diversification, while inter-clade competition might explain their final
decline during the late Oligocene. Our results provide a detailed dynamic

Optimizing Ranking Systems Online as Bandits,2021-10-12T08:07:46Z,Chang Li,"Ranking system is the core part of modern retrieval and recommender systems,
where the goal is to rank candidate items given user contexts. Optimizing
ranking systems online means that the deployed system can serve user requests,
e.g., queries in the web search, and optimize the ranking policy by learning
from user interactions, e.g., clicks. Bandit is a general online learning
framework and can be used in our optimization task. However, due to the unique
features of ranking, there are several challenges in designing bandit
algorithms for ranking system optimization. In this dissertation, we study and
propose solutions for four challenges in optimizing ranking systems online:
effectiveness, safety, nonstationarity, and diversification. First, the
effectiveness is related to how fast the algorithm learns from interactions. We
study the effective online ranker evaluation task and propose the MergeDTS
algorithm to solve the problem effectively. Second, the deployed algorithm
should be safe, which means the algorithm only displays reasonable content to
user requests. To solve the safe online learning to rank problem, we propose
the BubbleRank algorithm. Third, as users change their preferences constantly,
the algorithm should handle the nonstationarity. We formulate this
nonstationary online learning to rank problem as cascade non-stationary bandits
and propose CascadeDUCB and CascadeSWUCB algorithms to solve the problem.
Finally, the contents in ranked lists should be diverse. We consider the
results diversification task and propose the CascadeHybird algorithm that
considers both the item relevance and results diversification when learning
from user interactions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05807v1
Transmission of coherent information at the onset of interactions,2021-10-13T05:14:38Z,"Emily Kendall, Barbara Å oda, Achim Kempf","In this work, we investigate the parameters governing the rate at which a
quantum channel arises at the onset of an interaction between two systems, $A$
and $B$. In particular, when system $A$ is pre-entangled with an ancilla,
$\tilde{A}$, we quantify the early-time transmission of pre-existing
entanglement by calculating the leading order change in coherent information of
the complementary channel ($A\rightarrow B'$). We show that, when $A$ and $B$
are initially unentangled and $B$ is pure, there is no change in coherent
information to first order, while the leading (second) order change is
divergent. However, this divergence may be regulated by embedding the
conventional notion of coherent information into what we call the family of
$n$-coherent informations, defined using $n$-R\'enyi entropies. We find that
the rate of change of the $n$-coherent information at the onset of the
interaction is governed by a quantity, which we call the $n$-exposure, which
captures the extent to which the initial coherent information of $A$ with
$\tilde{A}$ is exposed to or `seen by' the interaction Hamiltonian between $A$
and $B$. We give examples in qubit systems and in the light-matter interaction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06499v2

challenging task in the field of remote sensing image analysis. The task is
non-trivial due to the following challenges: Firstly, intrinsic speckle noise
of SAR images inevitably degrades the neural network because of error gradient
accumulation. Furthermore, the correlation among various levels or scales of
feature maps is difficult to be achieved through summation or concatenation.
Toward this end, we proposed a siamese adaptive fusion network for SAR image
change detection. To be more specific, two-branch CNN is utilized to extract
high-level semantic features of multitemporal SAR images. Besides, an adaptive
fusion module is designed to adaptively combine multiscale responses in
convolutional layers. Therefore, the complementary information is exploited,
and feature learning in change detection is further improved. Moreover, a
correlation layer is designed to further explore the correlation between
multitemporal images. Thereafter, robust feature representation is utilized for
classification through a fully-connected layer with softmax. Experimental

planning systems for the problem often discretize numeric variables or impose
convex constraints on numeric variables, which harms the performance when
solving problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm framework to
solve numeric planning problems mixed with logical relations and numeric
changes based on gradient descent. We cast the numeric planning with logical
relations and numeric changes as an optimization problem. Specifically, we
extend syntax to allow parameters of action models to be either objects or
real-valued numbers, which enhances the ability to model real-world numeric
effects. Based on the extended modeling language, we propose a gradient-based
framework to simultaneously optimize numeric parameters and compute appropriate
actions to form candidate plans. The gradient-based framework is composed of an
algorithmic heuristic module based on propositional operations to select
actions and generate constraints for gradient descent, an algorithmic
transition module to update states to next ones, and a loss module to compute
loss. We repeatedly minimize loss by updating numeric parameters and compute
candidate plans until it converges into a valid plan for the planning problem.
In the empirical study, we exhibit that our algorithm framework is both
effective and efficient in solving planning problems mixed with logical

Viewing angle effects in quasar application to cosmology,2021-01-04T21:43:55Z,"Raj Prince, Bozena Czerny, Agnieszka Pollo","The symmetry axes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are randomly distributed in
space but highly inclined sources are heavily obscured and are not seen as
quasars with broad emission lines. The obscuring torus geometry determines the
average viewing angle, and if the torus geometry changes with the redshift,
this average viewing angle will also change. Thus the ratio between the
isotropic luminosity and observed luminosity may change systematically with
redshift. Therefore, if we use quasars to measure the luminosity distance by
evaluating the isotropic absolute luminosity and measuring the observed flux,
we can have a redshift-dependent bias which can propagate to cosmological
parameters. We propose a toy model for testing the effect of viewing angle
uncertainty on measurement of the luminosity distance. The model is based on
analytical description of the obscuring torus applied to one-parameter
observational data. It illustrates the possible change of the torus covering
factor between the two chosen redshift ranges. We have estimated the possible
error on specific cosmological parameters (H0,Omega_m) for the flat Lambda-CDM
cosmology if a method is calibrated at low redshift and applied to the higher
redshift. The errors on cosmological parameters due to potential dependence of
viewing angle on redshift are found to be potentially significant, and the
effect will have to be accommodated in the future in all quasar-based
cosmological methods. A careful systematic study of AGN mean viewing angle

  science conference",2021-01-07T18:59:26Z,"Mengyi Sun, Jainabou Barry Danfa, Misha Teplitskiy","Peer review is widely regarded as essential for advancing scientific
research. However, reviewers may be biased by authors' prestige or other
characteristics. Double-blind peer review, in which the authors' identities are
masked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer bias.
Although intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review
in reducing bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of
double-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of
5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its
reviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in
2018. We find that after switching to double-blind review, the scores given to
the most prestigious authors significantly decreased. However, because many of
these papers were above the threshold for acceptance, the change did not affect
paper acceptance decisions significantly. Nevertheless, we show that
double-blind peer review may have improved the quality of the selections by
limiting other (non-author-prestige) biases. Specifically, papers rejected in
the single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the
double-blind format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies
poorer quality papers. Interestingly, an apparently unrelated change - the
change of rating scale from 10 to 4 points - likely reduced prestige bias
significantly, to an extent that affected papers' acceptance. These results
provide some support for the effectiveness of double-blind review in reducing
prestige bias, while opening new research directions on the impact of peer

entropy of a material when it is subjected to an adiabatic electric field
change. Our tight-binding calculations linked to Fermi statistics, show that
the EC effect is sensitive to the stacking arrangement in trilayer graphene
(TLG) structures connected to a heat source, and is produced by changes of the
electronic density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level when external gate
fields are applied on the outer graphene layers. We demonstrate the AAA-stacked
TLG presents an inverse EC response (cooling), whereas the EC effect in
ABC-stacked TLG remains direct (heating) regardless of the applied gate field
potential strength. We reveal otherwise the TLG with Bernal-ABA stacking
geometry generates both the inverse and direct EC response in the same sample,
associated with a gate-dependent electronic entropy transition at finite
temperature. By varying the chemical potential to different Fermi levels, we
find maxima and minima of the DOS are located near the extremes of the
electronic entropy, which are correlated with sign changes in the differential
entropy per particle, giving a particular experimentally measurable electronic
entropy spectrum for each TLG geometry. The EC effect in quantum

products that were once popular may become no longer popular, and vice versa.
As a result, the system that aims to maintain long-term fairness on the item
exposure in different popularity groups must accommodate this change in a
timely fashion.
  Novel to this work, we explore the problem of long-term fairness in
recommendation and accomplish the problem through dynamic fairness learning. We
focus on the fairness of exposure of items in different groups, while the
division of the groups is based on item popularity, which dynamically changes
over time in the recommendation process. We tackle this problem by proposing a
fairness-constrained reinforcement learning algorithm for recommendation, which
models the recommendation problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP), so that the model can dynamically adjust its recommendation policy to
make sure the fairness requirement is always satisfied when the environment
changes. Experiments on several real-world datasets verify our framework's
superiority in terms of recommendation performance, short-term fairness, and
long-term fairness.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03584v1

binary MAXI J1820+070. We find that models having the disk inclinations within
those of either the binary or the jet imply significant changes of the
accretion disk inner radius during the luminous part of the hard spectral
state, with that radius changing from $>$100 to $\sim$10 gravitational radii.
The main trend is a decrease with the decreasing spectral hardness. Our
analysis requires the accretion flow to be structured, with at least two
components with different spectral slopes. The harder component dominates the
bolometric luminosity and produces strong, narrow, X-ray reflection features.
The softer component is responsible for the underlying broader reflection
features. The data are compatible with the harder component having a large
scale height, located downstream the disk truncation radius, and reflecting
mostly from remote parts of the disk. The softer component forms a corona above
the disk up to some transition radius. Our findings can explain the changes of
the characteristic variability time scales, found in other works, as being
driven by the changes of the disk characteristic radii.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04482v3

fundamental needs such as food and health needs, and most started to work from

parameter is varied. In scenarios where the parameter is varied continuously,
the rate of change of control parameter greatly affects the performance of
early warning signals (EWS) for such critical transitions.We study the impact
of variation of the control parameter with a finite rate on the performance of
\textcolor{black}{EWS for critical transitions} in a thermoacoustic system (a
horizontal Rijke tube) exhibiting subcritical Hopf bifurcation. There is a
growing interest in developing early warning signals for tipping in real
systems. Firstly, we explore the efficacy of early warning signals based on
critical slowing down and fractal characteristics. From this study, lag-1
autocorrelation (AC) and Hurst exponent H are found to be good measures to
predict the transition well-before the tipping point. The warning time,
obtained using AC and $H$, reduces with an increase in the rate of change of
the control parameter following an inverse power law relation. Hence, for very
fast rates, the warning time may be too short to perform any control action.
Furthermore, we report the observation of a hyperexponential scaling relation
between the AC and the variance of fluctuations during such dynamic Hopf
bifurcation. We construct a theoretical model for noisy Hopf bifurcation
wherein the control parameter is continuously varied at different rates to
study the effect of rate of change of parameter on EWS. Similar results,

planets in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf AD Leonis to reduced oxygen (O2),
removed biomass (dead Earth), varying carbon dioxide (CO2) and surface relative
humidity (sRH). Results suggest large O2 differences between the reduced O2 and
dead scenarios in the lower but not the upper atmosphere. Ozone (O3) and
nitrous oxide (N2O) also show this behavior. Methane depends on hydroxyl (OH),
its main sink. Abiotic production of N2O occurs in the upper layers.
Chloromethane (CH3Cl) decreases everywhere on decreasing biomass. Changing CO2
(from x1 to x100 present atmospheric level (PAL)) and surface relative humidity
(sRH) (from 0.1 percent to 100 percent) does not influence CH3Cl as much as
lowering biomass. Therefore, CH3Cl can be considered a good biosignature.
Changing sRH and CO2 has a greater influence on temperature than O2 and biomass
alone. Changing the biomass produces ~6 kilometer (km) in effective height (H)
in transmission compared with changing CO2 and sRH ( about 25km). In
transmission O2 is discernible at 0.76 microns for greater than 0.1 PAL. The O3
9.6 micron band was weak for the low O2 runs and difficult to discern from dead
Earth, however O3 at 0.3 microns could serve as an indicator to distinguish

social groups and knowledge domains, leading to differences even in the
monolingual scenario. Such variation in word usage is often called lexical
semantic change (LSC). The goal of LSC is to characterize and quantify language
variations with respect to word meaning, to measure how distinct two language
sources are (that is, people or language models). Because there is hardly any
data available for such a task, most solutions involve unsupervised methods to
align two embeddings and predict semantic change with respect to a distance
measure. To that end, we propose a self-supervised approach to model lexical
semantic change by generating training samples by introducing perturbations of
word vectors in the input corpora. We show that our method can be used for the
detection of semantic change with any alignment method. Furthermore, it can be
used to choose the landmark words to use in alignment and can lead to
substantial improvements over the existing techniques for alignment.

three different datasets, involving words with the same or different meanings.
Our methods not only provide significant improvements but also can lead to

  Oxidation",2021-02-04T02:52:29Z,"Minyung Song, Karen E. Daniels, Abolfazl Kiani, Sahar Rashidnadimi, Michael D. Dickey","This progress report summarizes recent studies of electrochemical oxidation
to modulate the interfacial tension of gallium-based alloys. These alloys,
which are liquid at ambient conditions, have the largest interfacial tension of
any liquid at room temperature. The ability to modulate the tension offers the
possibility to create forces that change the shape and position of the metal.
It has been known since the late 1800s that electrocapillarity-the use of
potential to modulate the electric double layer on the surface of metals in
electrolyte-lowers the interfacial tension of liquid metal. Yet, this
phenomenon can only achieve modest changes in interfacial tension since it is
limited to potential windows that avoid reactions. A recent discovery suggests
that reactions driven by the electrochemical oxidation of gallium alloys cause
the interfacial tension to decrease from ~500 mN/m at 0 V to ~0 mN/m at ~0.8 V,
a change in tension that goes well beyond what is possible via conventional
electrocapillarity or surfactants. The changes in tension are reversible;
reductive potentials return the metal back to a state of high interfacial
tension. This report aims to summarize key work and introduce beginners to this
field by including electrochemistry basics while addressing misconceptions. We
discuss applications that utilize modulations in interfacial tension of liquid

  Signalized Intersections under Mixed Traffic Environment",2021-02-06T05:42:18Z,"Chengyuan Ma, Chunhui Yu, Xiaogunag Yang","Trajectory planning for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the
potential to improve operational efficiency and vehicle fuel economy in traffic
systems. Despite abundant studies in this research area, most of them only
consider trajectory planning in the longitudinal dimension or assume the fully
CAV environment. This study proposes an approach to the decentralized planning
of CAV trajectories at an isolated signalized intersection under the mixed
traffic environment, which consists of connected and human-driven vehicles
(CHVs) and CAVs. A bi-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete
time to optimize the trajectory of a single CAV in both the longitudinal and
lateral dimensions given signal timings and the trajectory information of
surrounding vehicles. The upper-level model optimizes lateral lane-changing
strategies. The lower-level model optimizes longitudinal acceleration profiles
based on the lane-changing strategies from the upper-level model. Minimization
of vehicle delay, fuel consumption, and lane-changing costs are considered in
the objective functions. A Lane-Changing Strategy Tree (LCST) and a Parallel
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (PMCTS) algorithm are designed to solve the bi-level
optimization model. CAV trajectories are planned one by one according to their
distance to the stop bar. A rolling horizon scheme is applied for the dynamic
implementation of the proposed model with time-varying traffic condition.
Numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed trajectory planning
model compared with the benchmark cases without CAV trajectory planning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03518v1

and highly tunable alternative to conventional adiabatic demagnetization
refrigeration. Strong fluctuations in the low-$T$ quantum critical regime can
give rise to a large thermal entropy change and thus significant cooling effect

  graffiti walls both before and after",2021-02-19T09:50:06Z,"Martin Archer, Natt Day, Sarah Barnes","Impact evaluation in public engagement necessarily requires measuring change.
However, this is extremely challenging for drop-in activities due to their very
nature. We present a novel method of impact evaluation which integrates
graffiti walls into the experience both before and after the main drop-in
activity. The activity in question was a soundscape exhibit, where young
families experienced the usually inaudible sounds of near-Earth space in an
immersive and accessible way. We apply two analysis techniques to the captured
before and after data - quantitative linguistics and thematic analysis. These
analyses reveal significant changes in participants' responses after the
activity compared to before, namely an increased diversity in language used to
describe space and altered conceptions of what space is like. The results
demonstrate that the soundscape was surprisingly effective at innately
communicating key aspects of the underlying science simply through the act of
listening. The impacts also highlight the power of sonification in stimulating
public engagement, which, through reflection, can lead to altered associations,
perceptions, and understanding. Therefore, we show that this novel approach to
drop-in activity evaluation, using graffiti walls both before and after the
activity and applying rigorous analysis to this data, has the power to capture
change and, thus, have a short-term impact. We suggest that commonly used
evaluation tools suitable for drop-in activities, such as graffiti walls,
should be integrated both before and after the main activity in general, rather
than only using them afterwards as is typically the case.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09833v1

bringing to bear on phonon thermal transport. Also, it is a popular method to
tune thermal transport in solids. In this work, phonon and thermal transport
properties of GaN with wurtzite and zincblende structures at finite electric
field are investigated using first principles calculations from perspectives of
symmetry breaking and lattice deformation. Effects of electric field on phonon
transport properties including phonon dispersion and thermal conductivity from
response of electron density distribution only and response from lattice
changes are studied in zincblende GaN. It is found that the former has a small
but qualitative impact on phonon dispersion relations, i.e., splitting of
phonon branches, since it breaks symmetry of zincblende lattice. While the
latter affects both lattice symmetry and size, causing significant changes of
phonon properties and increase of thermal conductivity. In wurtzite GaN,
space-group-conserved lattice changes at finite electric field are studied with
lattice deformation only, where thermal conductivity decreases at electric
fields significantly with increase of anisotropy, much different from the

dealing with the challenge of correcting for differing behavior between the
data collection and learned policies. However, little attention has been paid
to potentially changing dynamics when transferring a policy to the online

this paper we address this problem with Augmented World Models (AugWM). We
augment a learned dynamics model with simple transformations that seek to

robust policies. We not only train our policy in this new setting, but also
provide it with the sampled augmentation as a context, allowing it to adapt to
changes in the environment. At test time we learn the context in a
self-supervised fashion by approximating the augmentation which corresponds to

dynamics. Operating at a critical threshold requires precise parameter tuning
and a corresponding mechanism remains an open question. Recent studies have
suggested that topological features observed in brain networks give rise to a
Griffiths phase, leading to power-laws in brain activity dynamics and the
operational benefits of criticality in an extended parameter region. Motivated
by growing evidence of neural correlates of different states of consciousness,
we investigate how topological changes affect the expression of a Griffiths
phase. We analyze the activity decay in modular networks using a
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible propagation model and find that we can control
the extension of the Griffiths phase by altering intra- and intermodular
connectivity. We find that by adjusting system parameters, we can counteract
changes in critical behavior and maintain a stable critical region despite
changes in network topology. Our results give insight into how structural
network properties affect the emergence of a Griffiths phase and how its
features are linked to established topological network metrics. We discuss how
those findings can contribute to understand the observed changes in functional
brain networks. Finally, we indicate how our results could be useful in the

environmental change from the viewpoint of the phylogenies of the living
individuals. We aim to understand better how the past traits of their ancestors
are shaped by the adaptation to the varying environment. The individuals are
characterized by a one-dimensional trait. The dynamics -- births and deaths --
depend on a time-changing mortality rate that shifts the optimal trait to the
right at constant speed. The population size is regulated by a nonlinear
non-local logistic competition term. The macroscopic behaviour can be described
by a PDE that admits a unique positive stationary solution. In the stationary
regime, the population can persist, but with a lag in the trait distribution
due to the environmental change. For the microscopic (individual-based)
stochastic process, the evolution of the lineages can be traced back using the
historical process, that is, a measure-valued process on the set of continuous
real functions of time. Assuming stationarity of the trait distribution, we
describe the limiting distribution, in large populations, of the path of an
individual drawn at random at a given time $T$. Freezing the non-linearity due
to competition allows the use of a many-to-one identity together with
Feynman-Kac's formula. This path, in reversed time, remains close to a simple
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It shows how the lagged bulk of the present
population stems from ancestors once optimal in trait but still in the tail of

"Measuring diachronic sense change: new models and Monte Carlo methods
  for Bayesian inference",2021-04-14T11:40:21Z,"Schyan Zafar, Geoff Nicholls","In a bag-of-words model, the senses of a word with multiple meanings, e.g.
""bank"" (used either in a river-bank or an institution sense), are represented
as probability distributions over context words, and sense prevalence is
represented as a probability distribution over senses. Both of these may change
with time. Modelling and measuring this kind of sense change is challenging due
to the typically high-dimensional parameter space and sparse datasets. A
recently published corpus of ancient Greek texts contains expert-annotated
sense labels for selected target words. Automatic sense-annotation for the word
""kosmos"" (meaning decoration, order or world) has been used as a test case in
recent work with related generative models and Monte Carlo methods. We adapt an
existing generative sense change model to develop a simpler model for the main
effects of sense and time, and give MCMC methods for Bayesian inference on all
these models that are more efficient than existing methods. We carry out
automatic sense-annotation of snippets containing ""kosmos"" using our model, and
measure the time-evolution of its three senses and their prevalence. As far as
we are aware, ours is the first analysis of this data, within the class of
generative models we consider, that quantifies uncertainty and returns credible
sets for evolving sense prevalence in good agreement with those given by expert

within nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) plasmonic resonators, which enable novel
optically-activated physical and chemical phenomena, and render these
nanocavities greatly sensitive to minute structural changes, down to the atomic
scale. Although a few of these structural parameters, primarily linked to the
nanoparticle and the mirror morphology, have been identified, the impact of
molecular assembly and organization of the spacer layer between them has often
been left uncharacterized. Here, we experimentally investigate how the complex
and reconfigurable nature of a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM)
adsorbed on the mirror surface impacts the optical properties of the NPoMs. We
fabricate NPoMs with distinct molecular organizations by controlling the
incubation time of the mirror in the thiol solution. Afterwards, we investigate
the structural changes that occur under laser irradiation by tracking the
bonding dipole plasmon mode, while also monitoring Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman
scattering from the molecules as a probe of their integrity. First, we find an
effective decrease in the SAM height as the laser power increases, compatible
with an irreversible change of molecule orientation caused by heating. Second,
we observe that the nanocavities prepared with a densely packed and more
ordered monolayer of molecules are more prone to changes in their resonance
compared to samples with sparser and more disordered SAMs. Our measurements
indicate that molecular orientation and packing on the mirror surface play a
key role in determining the stability of NPoM structures and hence highlight
the under-recognized significance of SAM characterization in the development of
NPoM-based applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05909v1

  supercapacitors: Electronic structure and adsorbent reorganisation effects",2021-05-14T12:15:30Z,"Anagha Sasikumar, Anouar Belhboub, Camille Bacon, Alexander C. Forse, John M. Griffin, Clare P Grey, Patrice Simon, CÃ©line Merlet","In situ NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique to investigate charge
storage mechanisms in carbon-based supercapacitors thanks to its ability to
distinguish ionic and molecular species adsorbed in the porous electrodes from
those in the bulk electrolyte. The NMR peak corresponding to the adsorbed
species shows a clear change of chemical shift as the applied potential
difference is varied. This variation in chemical shift is thought to originate
from a combination of ion reorganisation in the pores and changes in ring
current shifts due to the changes of electronic density in the carbon. While
previous Density Functional Theory calculations suggested that the electronic
density has a large effect, the relative contributions of these two effects is
challenging to untangle. Here, we use mesoscopic simulations to simulate NMR
spectra and investigate the relative importance of ion reorganisation and ring
currents on the resulting chemical shift. The model is able to predict chemical
shifts in good agreement with NMR experiments and indicates that the ring
currents are the dominant contribution. A thorough analysis of a specific
electrode/electrolyte combination for which detailed NMR experiments have been
reported allows us to confirm that local ion reorganisation has a very limited
effect but the relative quantities of ions in pores of different sizes, which
can change upon charging/discharging, can lead to a significant effect. Our
findings suggest that in situ NMR spectra of supercapacitors may provide
insights into the electronic structure of carbon materials in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06790v1
Fast and Slow Learning of Recurrent Independent Mechanisms,2021-05-18T17:50:32Z,"Kanika Madan, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Bernhard SchÃ¶lkopf, Yoshua Bengio","Decomposing knowledge into interchangeable pieces promises a generalization
advantage when there are changes in distribution. A learning agent interacting
with its environment is likely to be faced with situations requiring novel
combinations of existing pieces of knowledge. We hypothesize that such a
decomposition of knowledge is particularly relevant for being able to
generalize in a systematic manner to out-of-distribution changes. To study
these ideas, we propose a particular training framework in which we assume that
the pieces of knowledge an agent needs and its reward function are stationary
and can be re-used across tasks. An attention mechanism dynamically selects
which modules can be adapted to the current task, and the parameters of the
selected modules are allowed to change quickly as the learner is confronted
with variations in what it experiences, while the parameters of the attention
mechanisms act as stable, slowly changing, meta-parameters. We focus on pieces
of knowledge captured by an ensemble of modules sparsely communicating with
each other via a bottleneck of attention. We find that meta-learning the
modular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster
adaptation in a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a
partially observed grid world with image-level input. We also find that
reversing the role of parameters and meta-parameters does not work nearly as
well, suggesting a particular role for fast adaptation of the dynamically
selected modules.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08710v2

by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance,attenuated total reflection-fourier transform

in the air, phase change energy storage and shape memory properties of the
films were systematically analyzed. The results showed that all the mechanical
performance, thermal stability in air and shape memory properties of
polyrotaxanes were enhanced significantly compared to those of polyethylene
oxide (PEO). The form stability at temperatures above the melting point of PEO
significantly increased with the {\alpha}-CD addition. Further with the high
phase transition enthalpy and excellent cycle performance, the polyrotaxane
films are therefore promising sustainable and advanced form-stable phase change
materials for thermal energy storage. Notably, its ultra-high flexibility,

Mercury and 1 AU by spacecraft in longitudinal conjunction, investigating the
question: what causes the drastic alterations observed in some ICMEs during
propagation, while other ICMEs remain relatively unchanged? Of the two ICMEs,
the first one propagated relatively self-similarly, while the second one
underwent significant changes in its properties. We focus on the presence or
absence of large-scale corotating structures in the ICME propagation space
between Mercury and 1 AU, that have been shown to influence the orientation of
ICME magnetic structures and the properties of ICME sheaths. We determine the
flux rope orientation at the two locations using force-free flux rope fits as
well as the classification by Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2019). We also use
measurements of plasma properties at 1 AU, the size evolution of the sheaths
and ME with heliocentric distance, and identification of structures in the
propagation space based on in situ data, remote-sensing observations, and
simulations of the steady-state solar wind, to complement our analysis. Results
indicate that the changes observed in one ICME were likely caused by a stream
interaction region, while the ICME exhibiting little change did not interact
with any transients between Mercury and 1 AU. This work provides an example of
how interactions with corotating structures in the solar wind can induce
fundamental changes in ICMEs. Our findings can help lay the foundation for
improved predictions of ICME properties at 1 AU.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10602v1

  energy investment",2021-05-24T03:45:22Z,"Cunyi Yang, Tinghui Li, Khaldoon Albitar","The difficulty of balance between environment and energy consumption makes
countries and enterprises face a dilemma, and improving energy efficiency has
become one of the ways to solve this dilemma. Based on data of 158 countries
from 1980 to 2018, the dynamic TFP of different countries is calculated by
means of the Super-SBM-GML model. The TFP is decomposed into indexes of EC
(Technical Efficiency Change), TC (Technological Change) and EC has been
extended to PEC (Pure Efficiency Change) and SEC (Scale Efficiency Change).
Then the fixed effect model and fixed effect panel quantile model are used to
analyze the moderating effect and exogenous effect of energy efficiency on
PM2.5 concentration on the basis of verifying that energy efficiency can reduce
PM2.5 concentration. We conclude, first, the global energy efficiency has been
continuously improved during the sample period, and both of technological
progress and technical efficiency have been improved. Second, the impact of
energy efficiency on PM2.5 is heterogeneous which is reflected in the various
elements of energy efficiency decomposition. The increase of energy efficiency
can inhibit PM2.5 concentration and the inhibition effect mainly comes from TC
and PEC but SEC promotes PM2.5 emission. Third, energy investment plays a
moderating role in the environmental protection effect of energy efficiency.
Fourth, the impact of energy efficiency on PM2.5 concentration is heterogeneous
in terms of national attribute, which is embodied in the differences of
national development, science & technology development level, new energy

Robust Dynamic Network Embedding via Ensembles,2021-05-30T14:44:26Z,"Chengbin Hou, Guoji Fu, Peng Yang, Zheng Hu, Shan He, Ke Tang","Dynamic Network Embedding (DNE) has recently attracted considerable attention
due to the advantage of network embedding in various fields and the dynamic
nature of many real-world networks. An input dynamic network to DNE is often
assumed to have smooth changes over snapshots, which however would not hold for
all real-world scenarios. It is natural to ask if existing DNE methods can
perform well for an input dynamic network without smooth changes. To quantify
it, an index called Degree of Changes (DoCs) is suggested so that the smaller
DoCs indicates the smoother changes. Our comparative study shows several DNE
methods are not robust enough to different DoCs even if the corresponding input
dynamic networks come from the same dataset, which would make these methods
unreliable and hard to use for unknown real-world applications. To propose an
effective and more robust DNE method, we follow the notion of ensembles where
each base learner adopts an incremental Skip-Gram embedding model. To further
boost the performance, a simple yet effective strategy is designed to enhance
the diversity among base learners at each timestep by capturing different
levels of local-global topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to
state-of-the-art DNE methods, as well as the benefits of special designs in the
proposed method and its scalability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14557v2

two point masses, in General Relativity, are derived by a

linear order in the radiative losses of energy, linear-momentum and angular
momentum. The polynomial dependence on the masses of the 4-momentum changes is
shown to lead to non-trivial identities relating the various radiative losses.
At order $G^3$ our results lead to a streamlined classical derivation of
results recently derived within a quantum approach. At order $G^4$ we compute
the needed radiative losses to next-to-next-to-leading-order in the

important part of infectious disease surveillance and helps guide health
officials in implementing effective countermeasures. For disease surveillance
in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) combine more
than 65 individual forecasts of these numbers in an ensemble forecast at
national and state levels. We collected data on CDC ensemble forecasts of
COVID-19 fatalities in the United States, and compare them with easily
interpretable ``Euler'' forecasts serving as a model-free benchmark that is
only based on the local rate of change of the incidence curve. The term ``Euler
method'' is motivated by the eponymous numerical integration scheme that
calculates the value of a function at a future time step based on the current
rate of change. Our results show that CDC ensemble forecasts are not more
accurate than ``Euler'' forecasts on short-term forecasting horizons of one
week. However, CDC ensemble forecasts show a better performance on longer
forecasting horizons. Using the current rate of change in incidences as
estimates of future incidence changes is useful for epidemic forecasting on
short time horizons. An advantage of the proposed method over other forecasting
approaches is that it can be implemented with a very limited amount of work and
without relying on additional data (e.g., human mobility and contact patterns)

Always on Voting: A Framework for Repetitive Voting on the Blockchain,2021-07-22T10:49:48Z,"Sarad Venugopalan, Ivana StanÄÃ­kovÃ¡, Ivan Homoliak","Elections repeat commonly after a fixed time interval, ranging from months to

choices before the next elections. Another issue is the peak-end effect, where
the judgment of voters is based on how they felt a short time before the

repetitive voting framework that allows participants to vote and change elected
candidates or policies without waiting for the next elections. Participants are
permitted to privately change their vote at any point in time, while the effect
of their change is manifested at the end of each epoch, whose duration is

"Macroscopic modeling of strain-rate dependent energy dissipation of
  superelastic SMAs considering destabilization of martensitic lattice",2021-07-16T09:39:09Z,"A. Kaup, O. Altay, S. Klinkel","Superelastic shape-memory alloys (SMAs) are unique smart materials with a
considerable energy dissipation potential for dynamic loadings with varying
strain-rates. The energy dissipation depends on the latent heat generated by
the austenitic-martensitic transformation and the convection of that heat. Due
to the thermomechanical coupling, the martensitic nucleation stress level and
thus the propagation of martensitic phase fronts strongly depends on the
material temperature. High strain-rate interferes with the release of the
latent heat to the environment and determines quantity, position and
propagation of martensitic transformation bands. Lastly, high strain-rate
reduces the hysteresis surface. The propagation velocity and quantity of
martensitic bands have an impact on martensitic phase stability. The degree of
atomic disorder and accordingly the change in entropy influences the reverse
phase transformation from martensite to austenite. In other words, the
stability of the martensitic state affects the stress level of the reverse
transformation. However, in phenomenological superelastic SMA models, which are
used to simulate energy dissipation behavior, the effects of the rate-dependent
entropy change are not considered in particular. To incorporate the
rate-dependent entropy change, we improved a one-dimensional numerical model by
introducing an additional control variable in the free energy formulation for
solid-solid phase transformation of superelastic SMAs. In this model, the
observed effects of the strain-rate on the reverse transformation are taken
into account by calculating the rate-dependent entropy change. A comparison of
the numerical results with the experimental data shows that the model
calculates the dynamic superelastic hysteresis of SMAs more accurately.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12145v1

translating neural activity into digital commands to control external devices.
Neural adaptation, where the brain signals change in response to external
stimuli or movements, plays an important role in BMIs. When subjects purely use
neural activity to brain-control a prosthesis, some neurons will actively
explore a new tuning property to accomplish the movement task. The prediction
of this neural tuning property can help subjects adapt more efficiently to
brain control and maintain good decoding performance. Existing prediction
methods track the slow change of the tuning property in the manual control,
which is not suitable for the fast neural adaptation in brain control. In order
to identify the active neurons in brain control and track their tuning property
changes, we propose a globally adaptive point process method (GaPP) to estimate
the neural modulation state from spike trains, decompose the states into the
hyper preferred direction and reconstruct the kinematics in a dual-model
framework. We implement the method on real data from rats performing a
two-lever discrimination task under manual control and brain control. The
results show our method successfully predicts the neural modulation state and
identifies the neurons that become active in brain control. Compared to

The mystery of energy compensation,2021-07-26T13:13:23Z,Lewis G. Halsey,"The received wisdom on how activity affects energy expenditure is that the
more activity is undertaken, the more calories will have been burned by the end
of the day. Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,
burn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving
environments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other
animals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in
exercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases
in daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals
exhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating
some of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by
decreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy
compensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But
the processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy
compensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how
energy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant
exercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates
conflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level
activity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body
composition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity
are not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss
how changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations
in BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management. Currently
unexplored, these mechanisms and others may provide important insights into the
mystery of how energy compensation is achieved.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13418v1
"Heterogeneous Responses to the U.S. Narrative Tax Changes: Evidence from
  the U.S. States",2021-07-29T00:21:11Z,Masud Alam,"This paper investigates the assumption of homogeneous effects of federal tax
changes across the U.S. states and identifies where and why that assumption may
not be valid. More specifically, what determines the transmission mechanism of
tax shocks at the state level? How vital are states' fiscal structures,
financial conditions, labor market rigidities, and industry mix? Do these
economic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the
tax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a
panel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these
issues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms
of employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP
and personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically
significant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly
related to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial
composition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis
shows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax,
strict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are
relatively less responsive to federal tax changes. In contrast, the magnitude
of the response in real GDP, personal income, and employment to tax cuts is
relatively higher in states with a larger share of finance, manufacturing,
lower tax burdens, and flexible credit markets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13678v1
Did the Model Change? Efficiently Assessing Machine Learning API Shifts,2021-07-29T17:41:53Z,"Lingjiao Chen, Tracy Cai, Matei Zaharia, James Zou","Machine learning (ML) prediction APIs are increasingly widely used. An ML API
can change over time due to model updates or retraining. This presents a key
challenge in the usage of the API because it is often not clear to the user if
and how the ML model has changed. Model shifts can affect downstream
application performance and also create oversight issues (e.g. if consistency
is desired). In this paper, we initiate a systematic investigation of ML API
shifts. We first quantify the performance shifts from 2020 to 2021 of popular
ML APIs from Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others on a variety of datasets. We
identified significant model shifts in 12 out of 36 cases we investigated.
Interestingly, we found several datasets where the API's predictions became
significantly worse over time. This motivated us to formulate the API shift
assessment problem at a more fine-grained level as estimating how the API
model's confusion matrix changes over time when the data distribution is
constant. Monitoring confusion matrix shifts using standard random sampling can
require a large number of samples, which is expensive as each API call costs a
fee. We propose a principled adaptive sampling algorithm, MASA, to efficiently
estimate confusion matrix shifts. MASA can accurately estimate the confusion
matrix shifts in commercial ML APIs using up to 90% fewer samples compared to
random sampling. This work establishes ML API shifts as an important problem to
study and provides a cost-effective approach to monitor such shifts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14203v1

crashes and inconsistent look-and-feel when running at specific Android
versions. Existing works incur plenty of false positive and false negative
issue-detection rules by conducting trivial data-flow analysis while failing to
model the XML tree hierarchies of the Android configuration files. Besides,
little is known about how the changes in an Android framework can induce such
compatibility issues. To bridge such gaps, we conducted a systematic study by
analyzing 196 real-world issues collected from 43 popular apps. We identified
common patterns of Android framework code changes that induce such

\textsc{ConfDroid} that can automatically extract rules for detecting

execution based on a model learned from the common code change patterns.
Experiment results show that ConfDroid can successfully extract 282 valid
issue-detection rules with a precision of 91.9%. Among them, 65 extracted rules

quadrupolar distortions of the soliton. We then show that the time-evolution of
the gravitational potential and its impact on the perturbations can be well
described within the framework of time-dependent perturbation theory. Applying
our formalism to a synthetic ULDM halo reveals considerable mixing of
eigenstates, even though the overall density profile is relatively stable. Our

"Towards understanding network topology and robustness of logistics
  systems",2021-09-06T08:36:44Z,"Takahiro Ezaki, Naoto Imura, Katsuhiro Nishinari","Advanced integration of logistics systems has been promoted for the sake of
competitiveness and sustainability. Such efforts will enable more globally
optimal and flexible operations by efficiently utilizing transportation
capacity. At the same time, interconnection of transport operations increases
complexity at a network level, which reduces the predictability of the response
of the system to disruptions. However, our understanding of the behavior of
such systems is still limited. In particular, the topology of the network,
which changes as the systems are integrated, is an important factor that
affects the performance of the entire system. Knowledge of such mechanisms
would be useful in the design and evaluation of integrated logistics. Here, we
developed a simple mathematical model that extracts the essence of the problem
and performed extensive numerical experiments by Monte Carlo simulations for
three scenarios that mimic changes in demand: (i) locally and temporally
increased traffic demand, (ii) globally and temporally increased traffic
demand, and (iii) permanent change in demand pattern, under various conditions
on the type of route-finding algorithm, network structure, and transportation
capacity. Adaptive route-finding algorithms were more effective in square
lattice and random networks, which contained many bypass routes, than in
hub-and-spoke networks. Furthermore, the square lattice and random networks
were robust to the change in the demand pattern and temporal blockage of
delivery paths (e.g., due to high demand). We suggest that such preferable
properties are only present in networks with redundancy and that the bypass
structure is an important criterion for designing network logistics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02290v2

  decoherence channels",2021-09-05T10:24:23Z,"Nitish Kumar Chandra, Sarang S. Bhosale, Prasanta K. Panigrahi","In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations captured by
entropic and geometric measures of discord under the influence of dissipative
channels for widely used two qubit X state with maximally mixed marginals.
Identifying the phenomena of the preservation, sudden change and revival of
quantum correlation quantifiers, we determine their hierarchy of robustness
under memory-less decoherence channels. We find the analytical expressions of
decoherence probabilities at which sudden change occur when the first qubit is
subjected to the decoherence channels for multiple times. We deduce the exact
analytical expression for the preservation time, the duration for which quantum
correlations remain unaffected by noise. We also find the time duration between
the two sudden change phenomena of trace distance discord, and show its inverse
proportionality to the number of times a channel operates on the state. The
constraint relations of decoherence probabilities corresponding to the sudden
change region and preservation phenomena are obtained when both the qubits are
subjected to locally independent quantum channels for multiple times. Our
investigation provides physical insights and possible practical implementation
of the discord measures in noisy environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02640v2

similarly deep exposures ($\sim$170 - 350 ks). We perform detailed spectral

Recent changes in electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest
that the shocks moving through the inner ring have started interacting with
less dense circumstellar material, probably beyond the inner ring. We find
significant changes in the X-ray line flux ratios (among H- and He-like Si and
Mg ions) in 2018, consistent with changes in the thermal conditions of the
X-ray emitting plasma that we infer based on the broadband spectral analysis.
Post-shock electron temperatures suggested by line flux ratios are in the range
$\sim$0.8 - 2.5 keV as of 2018. We do not yet observe any evidence of

grown significantly and is now a key component of many industrial processes and
even a transparent participant in various activities performed in our daily
life. IoT systems are subjected to changes in the dynamic environments they
operate in. These changes (e.g. variations in bandwidth consumption or new
devices joining/leaving) may impact the Quality of Service (QoS) of the IoT
system. A number of self-adaptation strategies for IoT architectures to better
deal with these changes have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless,
they focus on isolated types of changes. We lack a comprehensive view of the
trade-offs of each proposal and how they could be combined to cope with
simultaneous events of different types.
  In this paper, we identify, analyze, and interpret relevant studies related
to IoT adaptation and develop a comprehensive and holistic view of the

desired. As the most prototypical chalcogenide phase change material, Ge2Sb2Te5
has been widely used in optical data storage and non-volatile electric memory
due to the fast switching speed and the low energy consumption. However, the
basic understanding of the structural dynamics on the atomic scale is still not
clear. Using femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculation and
TDDFT-MD simulation, we reveal the photoinduced ultrafast transition of the
local correlated structure in the averaged rock-salt phase of Ge2Sb2Te5. The
randomly oriented Peierls distortion among unit cells in the averaged rock-salt
phase of Ge2Sb2Te5 is termed as local correlated structures. The ultrafast
suppression of the local Peierls distortions in individual unit cell gives rise
to a local structure change from the rhombohedral to the cubic geometry within
~ 0.3 ps. In addition, the impact of the carrier relaxation and the large
amount of vacancies to the ultrafast structural response is quantified and
discussed. Our work provides new microscopic insights into contributions of the
local correlated structure to the transient structural and optical responses in

Non-classifiability of Ergodic Flows up to Time Change,2021-09-13T16:03:07Z,"Marlies Gerber, Philipp Kunde","A time change of a flow $\{T_t\}$, ${t\in\mathbb{R}}$, is a reparametrization
of the orbits of the flow such that each orbit is mapped to itself by an
orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the parameter space. If a flow
$\{S_t\}$ is isomorphic to a flow obtained by a reparametrization of a flow
$\{T_t\}$, then we say that $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$ are isomorphic up to a time
change. For ergodic flows $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$, Kakutani showed that this
happens if and only if the two flows have Kakutani equivalent transformations
as cross-sections.
  We prove that the Kakutani equivalence relation on ergodic invertible
measure-preserving transformations of a standard non-atomic probability space
is not a Borel set. This shows in a precise way that classification of ergodic
transformations up to Kakutani equivalence is impossible. In particular, our
results imply the non-classifiability of ergodic flows up to isomorphism after
a time change. Moreover, we obtain anti-classification results under
isomorphism for ergodic invertible transformations of a sigma-finite measure
space.
  We also obtain anti-classification results under Kakutani equivalence for
ergodic area-preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk, annulus, and

trading in an accurate model of contemporary financial markets. At any one
time, every trader in the market is trying to make as much profit as possible
given the current distribution of different other trading strategies that it
finds itself pitched against in the market; but the distribution of trading
strategies and their observable behaviors is constantly changing, and changes
in any one trader are driven to some extent by the changes in all the others.
Prior studies of coevolutionary dynamics in markets have concentrated on
systems where traders can choose one of a small number of fixed pure
strategies, and can change their choice occasionally, thereby giving a market
with a discrete phase-space, made up of a finite set of possible system states.
Here we present first results from two independent sets of experiments, where
we use minimal-intelligence trading-agents but in which the space of possible
strategies is continuous and hence infinite. Our work reveals that by taking
only a small step in the direction of increased realism we move immediately
into high-dimensional phase-spaces, which then present difficulties in
visualising and understanding the coevolutionary dynamics unfolding within the
system. We conclude that further research is required to establish better
analytic tools for monitoring activity and progress in co-adapting markets. We

evidencing a lowering and an increase of the electronic polarizability around
core-ionized Ni and W ions, respectively. At the same time, the character of
Zn-O bonds and the local structure around Zn ions do not change. It is
concluded that the dilution of NiWO$_4$ with Zn ions is accompanied by an
increase of the Ni-O bond ionicity and an increase of the W-O bond covalency.
These changes are attributed to the charge redistribution among [NiO$_6$] and

In contrast, the LM does not seem to perform as well when dealing with pattern
recognition or classification problems, and inefficient when networks become

continual learning. The ML models can present high error rates while the drifts
take place and the errors decrease only after the model learns the
distributions. This problem is more pronounced in a distributed setting where
multiple ML models are being used for different heterogeneous datasets and the
final model needs to capture all concept drifts. In this paper, we show that

Explaining GNN over Evolving Graphs using Information Flow,2021-11-19T04:29:38Z,"Yazheng Liu, Xi Zhang, Sihong Xie","Graphs are ubiquitous in many applications, such as social networks,
knowledge graphs, smart grids, etc.. Graph neural networks (GNN) are the
current state-of-the-art for these applications, and yet remain obscure to
humans. Explaining the GNN predictions can add transparency. However, as many
graphs are not static but continuously evolving, explaining changes in
predictions between two graph snapshots is different but equally important.
Prior methods only explain static predictions or generate coarse or irrelevant
explanations for dynamic predictions. We define the problem of explaining
evolving GNN predictions and propose an axiomatic attribution method to
uniquely decompose the change in a prediction to paths on computation graphs.
The attribution to many paths involving high-degree nodes is still not
interpretable, while simply selecting the top important paths can be suboptimal
in approximating the change. We formulate a novel convex optimization problem
to optimally select the paths that explain the prediction evolution.
Theoretically, we prove that the existing method based on
Layer-Relevance-Propagation (LRP) is a special case of the proposed algorithm

TRIP: Refining Image-to-Image Translation via Rival Preferences,2021-11-26T10:30:55Z,"Yinghua Yao, Yuangang Pan, Ivor W. Tsang, Xin Yao","Relative attribute (RA), referring to the preference over two images on the

however failed to reconcile the goal for fine-grained translation and the goal
for high-quality generation. We propose a new model TRIP to coordinate these
two goals for high-quality fine-grained translation. In particular, we
simultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to
the desired image with smooth subtle changes with respect to the interested
attributes; and a ranker that ranks rival preferences consisting of the input
image and the desired image. Rival preferences refer to the adversarial ranking
process: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the
input image in terms of the desired attributes; (2) the generator fools the
ranker to believe that the desired image changes the attributes over the input
image as desired. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the
ranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only. With an

"Head and Body: Unified Detector and Graph Network for Person Search in
  Media",2021-11-27T13:09:18Z,"Xiujun Shu, Yusheng Tao, Ruizhi Qiao, Bo Ke, Wei Wen, Bo Ren","Person search in media has seen increasing potential in Internet
applications, such as video clipping and character collection. This task is
common but overlooked by previous person search works which focus on
surveillance scenes. The media scenarios have some different challenges from
surveillance scenes. For example, a person may change his clothes frequently.
To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a Unified Detector and Graph
Network (UDGNet) for person search in media. UDGNet is the first person search
framework to detect and re-identify the human body and head simultaneously.
Specifically, it first builds two branches based on a unified network to detect
the human body and head, then the detected body and head are used for
re-identification. This dual-task approach can significantly enhance
discriminative learning. To tackle the cloth-changing issue, UDGNet builds two
graphs to explore reliable links among cloth-changing samples and utilizes a
graph network to learn better embeddings. This design effectively enhances the
robustness of person search to cloth-changing challenges. Besides, we
demonstrate that UDGNet can be implemented with both anchor-based and
anchor-free person search frameworks and further achieve performance
improvement. This paper also contributes a large-scale dataset for Person
Search in Media (PSM), which provides both body and head annotations. It is by
far the largest dataset for person search in media. Experiments show that
UDGNet improves the anchor-free model AlignPS by 12.1% in mAP. Meanwhile, it
shows good generalization across surveillance and longterm scenarios. The
dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/shuxjweb/PSM.git.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13888v1

  Changing-look AGNs",2021-12-14T10:40:47Z,"Jun-Jie Jin, Xue-Bing Wu, Xiao-Tong Feng","""Changing-look"" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) are a newly-discovered class
of AGNs that show the appearance (or disappearance) of broad emission lines
within a short time scale (months to years) and are often associated with the
dramatic change of their continuum emissions. They provide us an unprecedented
chance to directly investigate the host galaxy properties with minimal
contamination from the luminous central engine during the ""turn-off"" state,
which is difficult for normal luminous AGNs. In this work, for the first time,
we systematically characterize the stellar populations and star formation
histories (SFHs) of host galaxies for 26 turn-off CL-AGNs using the stellar
population synthesis code STARLIGHT. We find that the stellar populations of
CL-AGNs are similar to that of normal AGNs, excepts that the intermediate
stellar populations contribute more fraction. We estimate their stellar
velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{\star}$) and black hole masses ($\rm
M_{BH,vir}$) and find that CL-AGNs also follow the overall $\rm
M_{BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relationship. We also confirm the previous claim that
CL-AGNs tend to be biased towards lower Eddington ratio, and their extreme
variabilities are more likely due to the intrinsic changes of accretion rates.
In addition, CL-AGNs with recent star formations (SF) tend to have higher
Eddington ratio. Compared with previous studies, our analysis suggests that
there may be a correlation between the CL-AGN host galaxy properties and their
CL phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07284v2
Morphology of cooperatively rearranging regions in active glass formers,2021-12-15T11:03:57Z,"Dipanwita Ghoshal, Ashwin Joy","Super cooled liquids display increasingly heterogeneous dynamics as
temperature is lowered towards the glass transition ($T_{g}$). A hallmark of
this dynamical heterogeneity is the spontaneous emergence of cooperative
rearranging regions (CRRs) composed of fast moving particles. While these CRRs
in passive glass formers have been explored in great detail, thus understanding
is severely limited in active glass formers. The existing consensus on the
morphology of CRRs in a passive glass former prioritizes its fast subsets,
composed of fast moving particles. In the present study, we focus on a
synthetic athermal active glass former and show an equal contribution for the
morphology of CRRs from slow subsets as well. Both these subsets exhibit an
exponential distribution in their structure which strongly correlates with the
existence of CRRs. Interestingly, we also observe that the fractal dimensions
($d_{\text{f}}$) of these subsets share both string and compact like morphology
that tends to vary in opposite fashion with the control parameters, namely the
persistent time ($\tau_{p}$) and the effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$).
The fractal dimension $d_{\text{f}}$ measures the roughness or put simply the
compactness of fractal objects at their boundaries. More precisely, molecules
are loosely bound in a structure for which boundary is rough and thereby this
condition facilitates its structural change in terms of size and shape. It is
also a fact that any structural change is a signature of relaxation dynamics in
the context of glass forming liquids. Thus, in the present study, we observe a
change in $d_{\text{f}}$ with $T_{\text{eff}}$ and $\tau_{p}$ from the insights
of morphology variation that causes structural change, both in the BD limit and
non-equilibrium limit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08039v1

skyrmion dynamics in the metastable triangular lattice phase, enhancing
skyrmion stabilization through a remarkable and previously undetected skyrmion

flapping) or gas expulsion (rocket firing) is assumed to require environmental
interaction, due to conservation of momentum. As first noted in (Wisdom, 2003)

spacetime the non-commutativity of translations permits translation without
momentum exchange, just as falling cats and lizards can self-deform to reorient
in flat space without environmental interaction. Translation in curved space
can occur not only in gravitationally induced curved spacetime (where
translation is predicted to be on the order of $10^{-23}$ m per gait cycle) but
also in the curved surfaces encountered by locomotors in real-world
environments. Here we show that a precision robophysical apparatus consisting
of motors driven on curved tracks (and thereby confined to a spherical surface
without a solid substrate) can self-propel without environmental momentum
exchange (impulse) via shape changes that can generate gauge potentials that
manifest as translations. Our system produces shape changes comparable to the
environment's inverse curvatures and generates from zero momentum forward
movement of $10^{-1}$ cm per gait cycle even while resisted by weak
gravitational and frictional forces. Dissipation via friction eventually
arrests the robot but also imbues it with momentum which can be released upon a
cessation of shape changes. This work demonstrates how the interaction between
environmental curvature, active driving and geometric phases yields rich,

Changes in the interfacial tension crucially attribute to a governing capillary
pressure and hence an oil displacement in spontaneous imbibition process. The
current study attempts to elucidate an influence of such changes on spontaneous
imbibition by replacing surfactant concentration consecutively with two
approaches: sequential decrease and sequential increase in the interfacial
tension. Two fluid flow directions were examined simultaneously: co-current and
counter-current flows. With strongly oil-wet wettability, capillarity was a
resisting element to oil displacement and therefore controlled by the oil-water
interfacial tension. The sequential-reduced interfacial tension was found to
weaken such resisting capillary force gradually and resulted in consecutive
incremental oil production. On the contrary, the sequential-increased
interfacial tension initiated the lowest interfacial tension fluid that
produced an immediate large amount of oil, but did not much displace further
oil. The current study observed a greater oil recovery obtained from a
sequential reduction in the interfacial tension scheme (26.9%) compared to a
conventional single reduction scheme (22.4%), with both schemes attaining same
interfacial tension at last. In counter-current imbibition, same
characteristics of oil displacement were observed as in co-current imbibition,
with less oil produced and less sensitive to fluid changes due to negligible

iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing
using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection

significantly change the structure of thin disk by taking away the angular
momentum and energy of the disk. It is found that the period of outburst in
repeating CL AGNs can be substantially reduced by the magnetic fields.
Conversely, if we keep the period unchanged, the outburst intensity can be
raised for several times. These results can help to explain the observational

Group interactions modulate critical mass dynamics in social convention,2021-03-18T17:47:45Z,"Iacopo Iacopini, Giovanni Petri, Andrea Baronchelli, Alain Barrat","How can minorities of individuals overturn social conventions? The theory of
critical mass states that when a committed minority reaches a critical size, a
cascade of behavioural changes can occur, overturning apparently stable social

minorities of very different sizes, including extremely small ones, manage to
bring a system to its tipping point. Here, we explore this diversity of
scenarios by introducing group interactions as a crucial element of realism
into a model for social convention. We find that the critical mass necessary to
trigger behaviour change can be very small if individuals have a limited
propensity to change their views. Moreover, the ability of the committed
minority to overturn existing norms depends in a complex way on the group size.

AET-EFN: A Versatile Design for Static and Dynamic Event-Based Vision,2021-03-22T08:09:03Z,"Chang Liu, Xiaojuan Qi, Edmund Lam, Ngai Wong","The neuromorphic event cameras, which capture the optical changes of a scene,
have drawn increasing attention due to their high speed and low power
consumption. However, the event data are noisy, sparse, and nonuniform in the
spatial-temporal domain with an extremely high temporal resolution, making it
challenging to design backend algorithms for event-based vision. Existing
methods encode events into point-cloud-based or voxel-based representations,
but suffer from noise and/or information loss. Additionally, there is little
research that systematically studies how to handle static and dynamic scenes
with one universal design for event-based vision. This work proposes the
Aligned Event Tensor (AET) as a novel event data representation, and a neat
framework called Event Frame Net (EFN), which enables our model for event-based
vision under static and dynamic scenes. The proposed AET and EFN are evaluated
on various datasets, and proved to surpass existing state-of-the-art methods by
large margins. Our method is also efficient and achieves the fastest inference
speed among others.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11645v1
"An investigation of higher order moments of empirical financial data and
  the implications to risk",2021-03-24T13:54:08Z,"Luke De Clerk, Sergey Savel'ev","Here, we analyse the behaviour of the higher order standardised moments of
financial time series when we truncate a large data set into smaller and
smaller subsets, referred to below as time windows. We look at the effect of
the economic environment on the behaviour of higher order moments in these time
windows. We observe two different scaling relations of higher order moments
when the data sub sets' length decreases; one for longer time windows and
another for the shorter time windows. These scaling relations drastically
change when the time window encompasses a financial crisis. We also observe a
qualitative change of higher order standardised moments compared to the
gaussian values in response to a shrinking time window. We extend this analysis
to incorporate the effects these scaling relations have upon risk. We decompose
the return series within these time windows and carry out a Value-at-Risk
calculation. In doing so, we observe the manifestation of the scaling relations
through the change in the Value-at-Risk level. Moreover, we model the observed
scaling laws by analysing the hierarchy of rare events on higher order moments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13199v3
ECINN: Efficient Counterfactuals from Invertible Neural Networks,2021-03-25T09:23:24Z,"Frederik HvilshÃ¸j, Alexandros Iosifidis, Ira Assent","Counterfactual examples identify how inputs can be altered to change the
predicted class of a classifier, thus opening up the black-box nature of, e.g.,
deep neural networks. We propose a method, ECINN, that utilizes the generative
capacities of invertible neural networks for image classification to generate
counterfactual examples efficiently. In contrast to competing methods that
sometimes need a thousand evaluations or more of the classifier, ECINN has a
closed-form expression and generates a counterfactual in the time of only two
evaluations. Arguably, the main challenge of generating counterfactual examples
is to alter only input features that affect the predicted outcome, i.e.,
class-dependent features. Our experiments demonstrate how ECINN alters
class-dependent image regions to change the perceptual and predicted class of
the counterfactuals. Additionally, we extend ECINN to also produce heatmaps
(ECINNh) for easy inspection of, e.g., pairwise class-dependent changes in the
generated counterfactual examples. Experimentally, we find that ECINNh
outperforms established methods that generate heatmap-based explanations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13701v2

sentiment analysis to investigate changes in opinions about Italy reported on
Twitter before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using different lexicons-based
methods, we find a breakpoint corresponding to the date of the first
established case of COVID-19 in Italy that causes a relevant change in
sentiment scores used as proxy of the country reputation. Next, we demonstrate
that sentiment scores about Italy are strongly associated with the levels of
the FTSE-MIB index, the Italian Stock Exchange main index, as they serve as
early detection signals of changes in the values of FTSE-MIB. Finally, we make
a content-based classification of tweets into positive and negative and use two

Enabling Incremental Training with Forward Pass for Edge Devices,2021-03-25T17:43:04Z,"Dana AbdulQader, Shoba Krishnan, Claudionor N. Coelho Jr","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly deployed on end devices that exist
in constantly changing environments. In order for the system to maintain it's
accuracy, it is critical that it is able to adapt to changes and recover by
retraining parts of the network. However, end devices have limited resources
making it challenging to train on the same device. Moreover, training deep
neural networks is both memory and compute intensive due to the backpropagation
algorithm. In this paper we introduce a method using evolutionary strategy (ES)
that can partially retrain the network enabling it to adapt to changes and
recover after an error has occurred. This technique enables training on an
inference-only hardware without the need to use backpropagation and with
minimal resource overhead. We demonstrate the ability of our technique to
retrain a quantized MNIST neural network after injecting noise to the input.
Furthermore, we present the micro-architecture required to enable training on
HLS4ML (an inference hardware architecture) and implement it in Verilog. We
synthesize our implementation for a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale Field Programmable

method to a class of piecewise smooth hybrid dynamical systems by allowing for
changing hybrid modes in the forward pass, using the saltation matrix to update
the gradient information in the backwards pass, and using a reference extension
to account for mode mismatch. We demonstrate these changes on a variety of

A diachronic evaluation of gender asymmetry in euphemism,2021-06-03T19:00:11Z,"Anna Kapron-King, Yang Xu","The use of euphemisms is a known driver of language change. It has been
proposed that women use euphemisms more than men. Although there have been
several studies investigating gender differences in language, the claim about
euphemism usage has not been tested comprehensively through time. If women do
use euphemisms more, this could mean that women also lead the formation of new
euphemisms and language change over time. Using four large diachronic text

to advancing neuroscientific research. However, theoretical efforts to tackle
this fundamental problem are lacking, despite the abundant empirical data about
the brain that has been collected in the past few decades. To address this
shortcoming, this document introduces a hypothetical framework for the
functional nature of primitive neural networks. It analyzes the idea that the
activity of neurons and synapses can symbolically reenact the dynamic changes
in the world and thus enable an adaptive system of behavior. More
significantly, the network achieves this without participating in an
algorithmic structure. When a neuron's activation represents some symbolic
element in the environment, each of its synapses can indicate a potential
change to the element and its future state. The efficacy of a synaptic
connection further specifies the element's particular probability for, or
contribution to, such a change. As it fires, a neuron's activation is
transformed to its postsynaptic targets, resulting in a chronological shift of
the represented elements. As the inherent function of summation in a neuron
integrates the various presynaptic contributions, the neural network mimics the
collective causal relationship of events in the observed environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05181v2

magnetostriction amounts to relatively large values whereas the $a$-axis
magnetostriction exhibits strong variations with changing the orientation of
the applied magnetic field. It is discovered that at magnetic fields above the

capsule module is employed to exploit the spatial relationship of features.
Therefore, equivariant properties can be achieved by aggregating the features

Evolutionary Robust Clustering Over Time for Temporal Data,2021-06-14T09:07:42Z,"Qi Zhao, Bai Yan, Yuhui Shi","In many clustering scenes, data samples' attribute values change over time.
For such data, we are often interested in obtaining a partition for each time
step and tracking the dynamic change of partitions. Normally, a smooth change
is assumed for data to have a temporal smooth nature. Existing algorithms
consider the temporal smoothness as an a priori preference and bias the search
towards the preferred direction. This a priori manner leads to a risk of
converging to an unexpected region because it is not always the case that a
reasonable preference can be elicited given the little prior knowledge about
the data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new clustering framework
called evolutionary robust clustering over time. One significant innovation of
the proposed framework is processing the temporal smoothness in an a posteriori
manner, which avoids unexpected convergence that occurs in existing algorithms.
Furthermore, the proposed framework automatically tunes the weight of
smoothness without data's affinity matrix and predefined parameters, which
holds better applicability and scalability. The effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed framework are confirmed by comparing with state-of-the-art
algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07252v1

  changing payoffs",2021-06-15T15:33:10Z,George Loginov,"The paper presents a model of two-speed evolution in which the payoffs in the
population game (or, alternatively, the individual preferences) slowly adjust
to changes in the aggregate behavior of the population. The model investigates
how, for a population of myopic agents with homogeneous preferences, changes in
the environment caused by current aggregate behavior may affect future payoffs
and hence alter future behavior. The interaction between the agents is based on
a symmetric two-strategy game with positive externalities and negative feedback
from aggregate behavior to payoffs, so that at every point in time the
population has an incentive to coordinate, whereas over time the more popular
strategy becomes less appealing. Under the best response dynamics and the logit
dynamics with small noise levels the joint trajectories of preferences and
behavior converge to closed orbits around the unique steady state, whereas for
large noise levels the steady state of the logit dynamics becomes a sink. Under
the replicator dynamics the unique steady state of the system is repelling and
the trajectories are unbounded unstable spirals.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08224v1

estimates factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVARs) models where an

the sign restrictions with Uhlig's (2005) penalty function. Empirical findings
show a significant expansionary effect of tax cuts on the macroeconomic
variables. Cuts in personal and corporate income taxes cause a rise in output,
investment, employment, and consumption; however, cuts in personal taxes appear
to be a more effective fiscal policy tool than the cut in corporate income
taxes. Real GDP, employment, investment, and industrial production increase

random initialization learn similar representations. These disagreements raise
the question: which, if any, of these dissimilarity measures should we believe?
We provide a framework to ground this question through a concrete test:
measures should have sensitivity to changes that affect functional behavior,
and specificity against changes that do not. We quantify this through a variety
of functional behaviors including probing accuracy and robustness to
distribution shift, and examine changes such as varying random initialization

"Different molecular filament widths as tracers of accretion onto
  filaments",2021-08-12T15:41:40Z,"Gilberto C. GÃ³mez, Catherine Walsh, Aina Palau","We explore how dense filament widths, when measured using different molecular
species, may change as a consequence of gas accretion toward the filament. As a
gas parcel falls into the filament, it will experience different density,
temperature, and extinction values. The rate at which this environment changes
will affect differently the abundance of different molecules. So, a molecule
that forms quickly will better reflect the local physical conditions a gas
parcel experiences than a slower-forming molecule. Since these differences
depend on how the respective timescales compare, the different molecular
distributions should reflect how rapidly the environment changes, i.e., the
accretion rate toward the filament. We find that the filament widths measured
from time-dependent abundances for C2H, CO, CN, CS, and C3H2, are sensitive the
most to this effect, being those molecules the ones presenting also the wider
filament widths. On the contrary, molecules such as N2H+, NH3, H2CO, HNC or
CH3OH are not so sensitive to accretion and present the narrowest filament
widths. We propose that ratios of filament widths for different tracers could
be a useful tool to estimate the accretion rate onto the filament.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05808v2

directions. Further analysis of LC durations at different stages showed that
drivers of passenger cars might use different strategies to perform LCs when
they change lanes to different directions. However, drivers of heavy vehicles
in both directions used less time to occupy the target lanes. Results of this

Detecting changes in covariance via random matrix theory,2021-08-16T20:39:48Z,"Sean Ryan, Rebecca Killick","A novel method is proposed for detecting changes in the covariance structure
of moderate dimensional time series. This non-linear test statistic has a
number of useful properties. Most importantly, it is independent of the
underlying structure of the covariance matrix. We discuss how results from
Random Matrix Theory, can be used to study the behaviour of our test statistic
in a moderate dimensional setting (i.e. the number of variables is comparable
to the length of the data). In particular, we demonstrate that the test
statistic converges point wise to a normal distribution under the null
hypothesis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a range of
simulated datasets and find that it outperforms a range of alternative recently
proposed methods. Finally, we use our approach to study changes in the amount
of water on the surface of a plot of soil which feeds into model development

subjected to athermal quasi-static cyclic shear deformation, with the aim of
investigating the effect on the yielding behaviour of the degree of annealing,
which in turn depends on the preparation protocol. We find two distinct regimes
of annealing separated by a threshold energy. Poorly annealed glasses
progressively evolve towards the threshold energy as the strain amplitude is
increased towards the yielding value. Well annealed glasses with initial
energies below the threshold energy exhibit stable behaviour, with negligible
change in energy with increasing strain amplitude, till they yield.
Discontinuities in energy and stress at yielding increase with the degree of
annealing, consistently with recent results found in three dimensions. We
observe significant structural change with strain amplitude that closely
mirrors the changes in energy and stresses. We investigate groups of particles
that are involved in plastic rearrangements. We analyse the distributions of
avalanche sizes, of clusters of connected rearranging particles, and related
quantities, employing finite size scaling analysis. We verify previously
investigated relations between exponents characterising these distributions,

from healthcare to facial recognition, the stock market, autonomous vehicles,

theory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual
framework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction
of novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which
algorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing
institutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which
organizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure
and governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still
are unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be
contested. The institutional infrastructure surrounding AI-induced fields is
generally little elaborated, which could be an obstacle to the broader
institutionalization of AI-systems going forward.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07804v1

explained by the existence of point defects, most likely local complexes

under the impact of their surrounding (i.e., either other fluid particles or
the matrix) their shape within the class of ellipsoids of revolution; such a
change in shape is related to an energy change which is fed into suitably
defined selection rules in the deformation ""moves"" of the Monte Carlo
simulations. This concept represents a simple, yet powerful model of realistic,
deformable molecules with complex internal structures (such as dendrimers or
polymers). For the evaluation of the properties of the system we have used the
well-known quenched-annealed protocol (with its characteristic double average

skillful runoff forecast. This can be quantitatively done by tracking changes

transmission lobes in opposite transverse directions, but the transport angles

Twist-diameter coupling drives DNA twist changes by salt and temperature,2021-10-07T14:31:06Z,"Chen Zhang, Fujia Tian, Ying Lu, Bing Yuan, Zhi-Jie Tan, Xing-Hua Zhang, Liang Dai","DNA deformations play crucial roles in many biological processes and material
applications. During DNA deformation, DNA structural parameters often exhibit
non-trivial and counterintuitive couplings, such as the twist-stretch and
twist-bending couplings. Here, we reveal an unexpectedly strong negative
twist-diameter coupling through the synergy of magnetic-tweezers experiments,
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, and theoretical calculations. In
experiments, the DNA twist angle always increases with the concentration of
NaCl, KCl, or RbCl. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce salt-induced twist
changes and reveal the underlying physical mechanism: the reduction of DNA
diameter under a high salt concentration leads to the increase in DNA twist
angle through a strong negative twist-diameter coupling. The twist-diameter
coupling is mediated by two dihedral angles in DNA structure and the coupling
constant is 4.5 kBT/(deg nm) for one base-pair. Based on this coupling
constant, we predict the temperature-dependence of DNA twist -0.0102 deg/K per

change the behavior of the parser, such as enabling it to handle queries in a

preferable. To this end, we propose ControllAble Semantic Parser via Exemplar
Retrieval (CASPER). Given an input query, the parser retrieves related
exemplars from a retrieval index, augments them to the query, and then applies
a generative seq2seq model to produce an output parse. The exemplars act as a
control mechanism over the generic generative model: by manipulating the
retrieval index or how the augmented query is constructed, we can manipulate
the behavior of the parser. On the MTOP dataset, in addition to achieving

whether the experimentally measured 2D resistivity as a function of carrier
density is consistent (or not) with an underlying spontaneous

does not directly measure the change in the Fermi surface resulting from the

The Origin of Radio Emission in Black Hole X-ray Binaries,2021-10-22T06:09:09Z,"Xiang Liu, Ning Chang, Xin Wang, Qi Yuan","We studied the relation of accretion-jet power and disk luminosity,
especially the jet efficiencies and disk radiative efficiencies for different
accretion disks as well as black hole (BH) spin, in order to explore the origin
of radio emission in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs). We found that jet
efficiency increases more rapidly (efficient) than the nearly constant disk
radiative efficiency for thin disk component in high accretion regime, which
could account for the steep track ($\mu>1$) in the observed radio and X-ray
luminosity relations ($L_{\rm R}\propto L_{\rm X}^{\mu}$), but the thin disk
component may not be able to explain the standard track ($\mu\approx 0.6$) in
the BHXBs. For hot accretion flows (HAF), the resulting jet efficiency changes
along with the large range of accretions from quiescent state to nearly
Eddington state, which could account for the standard track in the BHXBs. The
BH spin-jet is discussed for the magnetic arrested disk (MAD) state; in this

Sequential Detection of a Temporary Change in Multivariate Time Series,2021-10-29T17:31:16Z,"V. Watson, F. Septier, P. Armand, C. Duchenne","In this work, we aim to provide a new and efficient recursive detection
method for temporarily monitored signals. Motivated by the case of the
propagation of an event over a field of sensors, we assumed that the change in
the statistical properties in the monitored signals can only be temporary.
Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, existing recursive and simple detection
techniques such as the ones based on the cumulative sum (CUSUM) do not consider
the temporary aspect of the change in a multivariate time series. In this
paper, we propose a novel simple and efficient sequential detection algorithm,
named Temporary-Event-CUSUM (TE-CUSUM). By combining with a new adaptive way to
aggregate local CUSUM variables from each data stream, we empirically show that
the TE-CUSUM has a very good detection rate in the case of an event passing
through a field of sensors in a very noisy environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15935v2
Time dependent signatures of core-collapse supernova neutrinos at HALO,2021-01-05T21:41:40Z,"B. Ekinci, Y. Pehlivan, Amol V. Patwardhan","We calculate the response of a lead-based detector, such as the Helium and
Lead Observatory (HALO) or its planned upgrade HALO-1kt to a galactic
core-collapse supernova. We pay particular attention to the time dependence of
the reaction rates. All reaction rates decrease as the neutrino luminosity
exponentially drops during the cooling period but the ratio of one-neutron (1n)
to two-neutron (2n) event rates in HALO is independent of this overall
decrease. Nevertheless, we find that this ratio still changes with time due to
the changing character of neutrino flavor transformations with the evolving
conditions in the supernova. In the case of inverted hierarchy, this is caused
by the fact that the spectral splits become less and less sharp with the
decreasing luminosity. In the case of normal hierarchy, it is caused by the
passage of the shock wave through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance
region. However, in both cases, we find that the change in the ratio of 1n to
2n event rates is limited to a few percent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01797v2

action models (Palmer 2017, Schmidt 2020) to predict progression-free survival
and objective response rate and serve as new predictive models to understand
drug combinations for early endpoints. The models can be applied to predict the
combination treatment effect for early endpoints given monotherapy data, or to

Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences can

behaviour of the neutron-star equation of state. In this study, we use
finite-entropy equations of state to show that a post-merger remnant can spin
up due to cooling. The magnitude of the spin-up depends on the neutron-star
equation of state. If hyperons are present, the post-merger spin-up changes the
peak gravitational-wave frequency by $\sim 540$ Hz, when the entropy per baryon
drops from $s=2$ $k_B$ to $s=0$ $k_B$. If hyperons are not present, the

Nowcasting Gentrification Using Airbnb Data,2021-01-15T01:08:47Z,"Shomik Jain, Davide Proserpio, Giovanni Quattrone, Daniele Quercia","There is a rumbling debate over the impact of gentrification: presumed
gentrifiers have been the target of protests and attacks in some cities, while
they have been welcome as generators of new jobs and taxes in others. Census

between spin and momentum induces a spin dependence in the scattering processes
taking place in the gas. Here we show that, at weak couplings, such modulation
of the collisions leads to an effective Hamiltonian which is equivalent to the
one of an artificial spinor gas with spin-changing collisions that are tunable

challenges to traditional multivariate statistical process monitoring (SPM)

addition, the requirement of sufficient reference samples limits the
application of traditional charts in high dimension low sample size scenarios

abnormal behaviors that are caused by a small set of variables, i.e., sparse

imagine that the change in energy is compensated by the measuring apparatus or
environment. We show that this is not true; the change in the energy of a state
after measurement can be arbitrarily large, independent of the physical
measurement process. In Everettian quantum theory, while the expectation value
of the Hamiltonian is conserved for the wave function of the universe

"A Novel Trick to Overcome the Phase Space Volume Change and the Use of
  Hamiltonian Trajectories with an emphasis on the Free Expansion",2021-02-11T17:02:44Z,P. D. Gujrati,"We extend and successfully apply a recently proposed microstate
nonequilibrium thermodynamics to study expansion/contraction processes. Here,
the numbers of initial and final microstates are different so they cannot be
connected by unique Hamiltonian trajectories. This commonly happens when the
phase space volume changes, and has not been studied so far using Hamiltonian
trajectories that can be inverted to yield an identity mapping between initial
and final microstates as the parameter in the Hamiltonian is changed. We
propose a trick to overcome this hurdle with a focus on free expansion in an
isolated system, where the concept of dissipated work is not clear. The trick
is shown to be thermodynamically consistent and can be extremely useful in
simulation. We justify that it is the thermodynamic average of the internal
microwork done by a microstate that is dissipated; this microwork is different
from the exchange microwork with the vacuum, which vanishes. We also establish
that the microwork is nonnegative for free expansion, which is remarkable,
since its sign is not fixed in a general process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06122v1

the, from a news media's perspective, paradoxical situation where the same news

NodeSRT: A Selective Regression Testing Tool for Node.js Application,2021-03-31T22:23:48Z,Yufeng Chen,"Node.js is one of the most popular frameworks for building web applications.
As software systems mature, the cost of running their entire regression test
suite can become significant. Selective Regression Testing (SRT) is a technique
that executes only a subset of tests the regression test suite can detect
software failures more efficiently. Previous SRT studies mainly focused on
standard desktop applications. Node.js applications are considered hard to
perform test reduction because of Node's asynchronous, event-driven programming
model and because JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. In this paper,
we present NodeSRT, a Selective Regression Testing framework for Node.js
applications. By performing static and dynamic analysis, NodeSRT identifies the
relationship between changed methods and tests, then reduces the regression
test suite to only tests that are affected by the change to improve the
execution time of the regression test suite. To evaluate our selection
technique, we applied NodeSRT to two open-source projects: Uppy and Simorgh,
then compared our approach with the retest-all strategy and current
industry-standard SRT technique: Jest OnlyChange. The results demonstrate that
NodeSRT correctly selects affected tests based on changes and is 250% faster,

our results to the conventional case where radiation domination during early

field amplitude can change by orders of magnitude if we assume a non-standard
history of cosmology. That is because the Hubble rate determines which
processes are efficient. We find that a change in Hubble rate can have a
significant impact on when the weak sphalerons become active. As a result of a
change in the evolution of baryonic asymmetry, alters the evolution of
hypermagnetic field amplitude. It is known that if the hypermagnetic field
amplitude is large enough, it can save the baryon asymmetry from diminishing.
We show that whether a small seed of hypermagnetic field amplitude can be
amplified to a large enough value will strongly depend on the history of
cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04815v2

Operational approach to metastability,2021-04-11T20:25:27Z,Katarzyna Macieszczak,"In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic approach for considering
changes in dynamics of finitely dimensional open quantum systems governed by
master equations. This experimentally motivated approach arises from
considering how the averages of system observables change with time and
quantifies how non-stationary the system is during a given time regime. By
drawing an analogy with the exponential decay, we are able to further
investigate regimes when such changes are negligible according to the
logarithmic scale of time, and thus the system is approximately stationary.
While this is always the case within the initial and final regimes of the
dynamics, with the system respectively approximated by its initial and
asymptotic states, we show that a distinct regime of approximate stationarity
may arise. In turn, we establish a quantitative description of the phenomenon
of metastability in open quantum systems. The initial relaxation occurring
before the corresponding metastable regime and of the long-time dynamics taking
place afterwards are also characterised. Furthermore, we explain how
metastability relates to the separation in the real part of the master equation
spectrum and connect our approach to the spectral theory of metastability,
clarifying when the latter follows. All of our general results directly
translate to Markovian dynamics of classical stochastic systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05095v2
Relaxation process of magnetic friction under sudden changes in velocity,2021-04-13T04:47:48Z,Hisato Komatsu,"Although there have been many studies of statistical mechanical models of

Ising spins that interact with each other, and investigate the relaxation of
the system when the relative velocity $v$ changes suddenly. The situation where
$v$ is given is realized by attaching the chain to a spring, the other end of
which moves with a constant velocity $v$. Numerical simulation finds that, when
the spring constant has a moderate value, the relaxation of the frictional
force is divided into two processes, which are a sudden change and a slow
relaxation. This behavior is also observed on regular solid surfaces, although
caused by different factors than our model. More specifically, the slow
relaxation process is caused by relaxation of the magnetic structure in our

try to address this issue of DARTS by identifying indicators for early
stopping, regularising the search objective to reduce the dominance of some
operations, or changing the parameterisation of the search problem. In this

Deep Lucas-Kanade Homography for Multimodal Image Alignment,2021-04-22T04:11:29Z,"Yiming Zhao, Xinming Huang, Ziming Zhang","Estimating homography to align image pairs captured by different sensors or
image pairs with large appearance changes is an important and general challenge
for many computer vision applications. In contrast to others, we propose a
generic solution to pixel-wise align multimodal image pairs by extending the
traditional Lucas-Kanade algorithm with networks. The key contribution in our
method is how we construct feature maps, named as deep Lucas-Kanade feature map
(DLKFM). The learned DLKFM can spontaneously recognize invariant features under
various appearance-changing conditions. It also has two nice properties for the
Lucas-Kanade algorithm: (1) The template feature map keeps brightness
consistency with the input feature map, thus the color difference is very small
while they are well-aligned. (2) The Lucas-Kanade objective function built on
DLKFM has a smooth landscape around ground truth homography parameters, so the
iterative solution of the Lucas-Kanade can easily converge to the ground truth.
With those properties, directly updating the Lucas-Kanade algorithm on our
feature maps will precisely align image pairs with large appearance changes. We

Automatic Learning to Detect Concept Drift,2021-05-04T11:10:39Z,"Hang Yu, Tianyu Liu, Jie Lu, Guangquan Zhang","Many methods have been proposed to detect concept drift, i.e., the change in

that learns to classify concept drift by tracking the changed pattern of error
rates. Specifically, in the training phase, we extract meta-features based on
the error rates of various concept drift, after which a meta-detector is
developed via a prototypical neural network by representing various concept
drift classes as corresponding prototypes. In the detection phase, the learned
meta-detector is fine-tuned to adapt to the corresponding data stream via
stream-based active learning. Hence, Meta-ADD uses machine learning to learn to

understanding evenness, there is currently no research exploring how the

constant, the families of divergence-based evenness measures nest. This
property allows them to be ranked based on their reactivity to changes in
relatively even assemblages or changes in relatively uneven ones. We establish
this ranking and explore how the distance-based measures relate to it for both
order q=2 and q=1. We also derive a new family of distance-based measures that
captures the angular distance between the vector of relative abundances and a
perfectly even vector and is highly reactive to changes in even assemblages.
Finally, we show that if we only require evenness to be a divergence, then any

mass-conservation equation that describes how the atom density changes in time
and space. The model is simple, yet it can properly capture the variation in
the free energy landscape as the temperature is changed. We describe to
construct a temperature-atom-density phase diagram using this energy landscape,
and we give a simple demonstration of solidification using the model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05555v1
Exploring the change of semiconductor hole mass under Coulomb scattering,2021-07-13T05:21:37Z,"Shiue-Yuan Shiau, Monique Combescot","Semiconductor valence holes are known to have heavy and light effective
masses; but the consequence of this mass difference on Coulomb scatterings has
been considered intractable and thus ignored up to now. The reason is that the
heavy/light index is quantized along the hole momentum that changes in a
Coulomb scattering; so, a heavy hole can turn light, depending on the
scattering angle. This mass change has never been taken into account in
many-body problems, and a single ``average'' hole mass has been used instead.
In order to study the missed consequences of this crude approximation, the
first necessary step is to determine the Coulomb scatterings with valence holes
in a precise way. We here derive these scatterings from scratch, starting from
the threefold valence-electron spatial level, all the way through the
spin-orbit splitting, the Kohn-Luttinger effective Hamiltonian, its spherical
approximation, and the phase factors that appear when turning from valence
electron to hole operators, that is, all the points of semiconductor physics
that render valence holes so different from a na\""{i}ve positive charge.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05854v1
Spatiotemporal refraction of light in an epsilon-near-zero ITO layer,2021-07-13T10:35:03Z,"Justus Bohn, Ting Shan Luk, Euan Hendry","When light travels through a medium in which the refractive index is rapidly
changing with time, the light will undergo a shift in its frequency. Large
frequency shifting effects have recently been reported for transparent
conductive oxides. These observations have been interpreted as emerging from
temporal changes to the propagation phase in a bulk medium resulting from
temporal variations in the refractive index, an effect referred to as temporal
refraction. Here, we show that the frequency shift in an epsilon-near-zero
(ENZ) layer made of indium tin oxide (ITO) originates not only from this bulk
response, but includes a significant effect resulting from temporal changes to
the spatial boundary conditions. This boundary effect can lead to a dominant
opposing shift to the bulk effect for certain angles. Hence, this process gives
rise to a frequency shift that can be tailored through the angle of incidence,
decoupling the amplitude and phase modulation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05970v1
Dynamical vortices in electron-phonon superconductors,2021-07-16T17:00:05Z,"Morten H. Christensen, Andrey V. Chubukov","We analyze the structure of an $s-$wave superconducting gap in systems with
electron-phonon attraction and electron-electron repulsion. Earlier works have
found that superconductivity develops despite strong repulsion, but the gap,
$\Delta (\omega_m)$, necessarily changes sign along the Matsubara axis. We
analyze the sign-changing gap function from a topological perspective using the
knowledge that a nodal point of $\Delta (\omega_m)$ is the center of dynamical
vortex. We consider two models with different cutoffs for the repulsive
interaction and trace the vortex positions along the Matsubara axis and in the
upper frequency half plane upon changing the relative strength of the
attractive and repulsive parts of the interaction. We discuss how the presence
of dynamical vortices affects the gap structure along the real axis, detectable
in ARPES experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08012v1

Error Floor Analysis of LDPC Column Layered Decoders,2021-07-23T22:59:05Z,"Ali Farsiabi, Amir H. Banihashemi","In this paper, we analyze the error floor of column layered decoders, also
known as shuffled decoders, for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under
saturating sum-product algorithm (SPA). To estimate the error floor, we
evaluate the failure rate of different trapping sets (TSs) that contribute to
the frame error rate in the error floor region. For each such TS, we model the
dynamics of SPA in the vicinity of the TS by a linear state-space model that
incorporates the information of the layered message-passing schedule.
Consequently, the model parameters and the failure rate of the TS change as a
result of the change in the order by which the messages of different layers are
updated. This, in turn, causes the error floor of the code to change as a
function of scheduling. Based on the proposed analysis, we then devise an
efficient search algorithm to find a schedule that minimizes the error floor.
Simulation results are presented to verify the accuracy of the proposed error
floor estimation technique.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11479v1

changes sign, then smooth solutions exist globally. We prove the converse: if
the initial momentum changes sign, then $C^2$ solutions $u$ must break down in
finite time. The technique is similar to that of McKean, who proved the same
for the Camassa-Holm equation, but we introduce a new perspective involving a
change of variables to treat the equation as a family of planar systems with
central force for which the conserved angular momentum is precisely the

isotropy is a desirable geometrical property, fine-tuning does not necessarily
result in isotropy enhancements. Moreover, local structures in pre-trained
contextual word representations (CWRs), such as those encoding token types or
frequency, undergo a massive change during fine-tuning. Our experiments show
dramatic growth in the number of elongated directions in the embedding space,

energy vanished at the critical point. It can be stated equivalently that
quantum critical point is obtained when the determinant of Hopfield-Bogoliubov
matrix vanishes. We analytically obtain the Hopfield-Bogoliubov matrix
corresponding to the general quadratic Hamiltonian. For single-mode system the
appearance of the exceptional point in Hopfield-Bogoliubov matrix is equivalent
to the disappearance of the determinant of Hopfield-Bogoliubov matrix. However,
in multi-mode bosonic system, they are not equivalent except in some special
cases. For example, in the case of perfect symmetry, that is, swapping any two
subsystems and keeping the total Hamiltonian invariable, the exceptional point
and the degenerate point coincide all the time when the phase transition
occurs. When the exceptional point and the degenerate point do not coincide, we
find a significant result. With the increase of two-photon driving intensity,
the normal phase changes to the superradiant phase, then the superradiant phase

Behavior of k-NN as an Instance-Based Explanation Method,2021-09-14T22:32:19Z,"Chhavi Yadav, Kamalika Chaudhuri","Adoption of DL models in critical areas has led to an escalating demand for
sound explanation methods. Instance-based explanation methods are a popular
type that return selective instances from the training set to explain the
predictions for a test sample. One way to connect these explanations with
prediction is to ask the following counterfactual question - how does the loss
and prediction for a test sample change when explanations are removed from the
training set? Our paper answers this question for k-NNs which are natural
contenders for an instance-based explanation method. We first demonstrate
empirically that the representation space induced by last layer of a neural
network is the best to perform k-NN in. Using this layer, we conduct our
experiments and compare them to influence functions (IFs)
~\cite{koh2017understanding} which try to answer a similar question. Our
evaluations do indicate change in loss and predictions when explanations are
removed but we do not find a trend between $k$ and loss or prediction change.

CIFAR-10. Surprisingly, we do not observe much difference in the behavior of
k-NNs vs. IFs on this question. We attribute this to training set subsampling

recalling some basic facts about the Carnot cycle, we present two very
different systems that undergo discontinuous phase transitions (ice/water and

temperature $T_tr$ were independent of other parameters, such as pressure or

construct a perpetuum mobile of the second kind. Since the proposed cyclic
processes can be realized reversibly in the limit of infinitesimal changes in

passage statistics is determined from this random process. The thermodynamic
parameter conjugated to the first-passage time is the same as the Laplace
transform parameter of the first-passage time distribution in the partition
function. The corresponding partition function is divided into multipliers, one
of which is associated with the equilibrium parameters, and the second one -
with the parameters of the first-passage time distribution. The thermodynamic
parameter conjugated to the first-passage time can be expressed in terms of the
deviation of the entropy from the equilibrium value. Thus, all moments of the

length changes driven by external magnetic field in this field region

the opposite behaviour appear at higher fields. Furthermore, there are
remarkable effects of slight changes in the applied uniaxial pressure on the
magnetostrictive response of CoTiO$_3$ persisting to temperatures well above

uses a multi-step strategy based on a regularized objective function that leads
to fast identification of candidate break points, followed by clustering steps
to select the final set of break points and subsequent estimation with false

We find that while most metrics behave as intended for sufficiently simple
datasets, some fail to tell the difference between good and bad counterfactuals

scores to tiny adversarial-like changes, wrongly identifying such changes as
superior counterfactual examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose two new

interacting bipartite quantum system and its environment by decomposing the
energy of the system to local and correlation-related contributions. When the
system Hamiltonian is time-independent, no external work is performed. In this
case, energy exchange between the system and its environment occurs only due to
the change in the state of the system. We investigate possibility of a special
case where the energy exchange with the environment occurs exclusively due to
changes in the correlation between the constituent parts of the bipartite
system, while their local energies remain constant. We find sufficient
conditions for preserving local energies. It is proven that under these
conditions and within the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) dynamics
this scenario is not possible for all initial states of the bipartite system.
Nevertheless, it is still possible to find special initial states for which the
local energies remain unchanged during the associated evolution and the whole
energy exchange is only due to the change in the correlation energy. We
illustrate our results with an example.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00296v1

  Restricted Human-Machine Interaction",2021-11-02T22:49:25Z,"Christian Hildebrand, Donna Hoffman, Tom Novak","The use of natural language and voice-based interfaces gradu-ally transforms
how consumers search, shop, and express their preferences. The current work
explores how changes in the syntactical structure of the interaction with
conversational interfaces (command vs. request based expression modalities)
negatively affects consumers' subjective task enjoyment and systematically
alters objective vocal features in the human voice. We show that requests (vs.
commands) lead to an in-crease in phonetic convergence and lower phonetic
latency, and ultimately a more natural task experience for consumers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work docu-menting that altering the
input modality of how consumers interact with smart objects systematically
affects consumers' IoT experience. We provide evidence that altering the
required input to initiate a conversation with smart objects provokes
systematic changes both in terms of consumers' subjective experience and
objective phonetic changes in the human voice. The current research also makes
a methodological con-tribution by highlighting the unexplored potential of
feature extraction in human voice as a novel data format linking consumers'

data is transferred - downlinked - to a ground station. Constraint on the
downlink capabilities therefore affects any downstream application. In
contrast, RaVAEn pre-processes the sampled data directly on the satellite and
flags changed areas to prioritise for downlink, shortening the response time.
We verified the efficacy of our system on a dataset composed of time series of

For image segmentation, Seg-Net is one of the most popular and general CNN

segmentation. After the segmentation, we compared the disparity between both

Intuitive Shape Editing in Latent Space,2021-11-24T13:33:10Z,"Tim Elsner, Moritz Ibing, Victor Czech, Julius Nehring-Wirxel, Leif Kobbelt","The use of autoencoders for shape editing or generation through latent space
manipulation suffers from unpredictable changes in the output shape. Our
autoencoder-based method enables intuitive shape editing in latent space by
disentangling latent sub-spaces into style variables and control points on the

Lipschitz-type constraint to the loss function, i.e. bounding the change of the
output shape proportionally to the change in latent space, leading to
interpretable latent space representations. The control points on the surface

time-reparametization invariant system. We also observe that the inability of
this Hamiltonian to probe change can be related to its inability to
discriminate between states of such a system. However, if the

performance of learnable models based on deep networks. By leveraging
traditional data augmentations and homography transformations, these networks
learn to detect corners under adverse conditions such as extreme illumination
changes. However, their generalization capabilities are limited to corner-like
features detected a priori by classical methods or synthetically generated
data.
  In this paper, we propose the Correspondence Network (CorrNet) that learns to
detect repeatable keypoints and to extract discriminative descriptions via
unsupervised contrastive learning under spatial constraints. Our experiments
show that CorrNet is not only able to detect low-level features such as
corners, but also high-level features that represent similar objects present in
a pair of input images through our proposed joint guided backpropagation of
their latent space. Our approach obtains competitive results under viewpoint
changes and achieves state-of-the-art performance under illumination changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12002v2
"Control of site occupancy by variation of the Zn and Al content in
  NiZnAl ferrite epitaxial films with low magnetic damping",2021-12-23T10:53:33Z,"Julia Lumetzberger, Verena Ney, Anna Zhakarova, Daniel Primetzhofer, Kilian Lenz, Andreas Ney","The structural and magnetic properties of Zn/Al doped nickel ferrite thin
films can be adjusted by changing the Zn and Al content. The films are
epitaxially grown by reactive magnetron sputtering using a triple cluster
system to sputter simultaneously from three different targets. Upon the
variation of the Zn content the films remain fully strained with similar
structural properties, while the magnetic properties are strongly affected. The
saturation magnetization and coercivity as well as resonance position and
linewidth from ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements are altered depending
on the Zn content in the material. The reason for these changes can be
elucidated by investigation of the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra to
gain site and valence specific information with elemental specificity.
Additionally, from a detailed investigation by broadband FMR a minimum in
g-factor and linewidth could be found as a function of film thickness.
Furthermore, the results from a variation of the Al content using the same set
of measurement techniques is given. Other than for Zn, the variation of Al
affects the strain and even more pronounced changes to the magnetic properties
are apparent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12456v1

"Abolitionist Networks: Modeling Language Change in Nineteenth-Century
  Activist Newspapers",2021-03-12T21:26:30Z,"Sandeep Soni, Lauren Klein, Jacob Eisenstein","The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States remains
among the most significant social and political movements in US history.
Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in spreading information and
shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition of
slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about
the movement for scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the
movement and its leaders. This paper supplements recent qualitative work on the
role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black press,
with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings,
we identify which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations -- the
introduction of new usages of specific words -- and which newspapers tended to
follow. We then aggregate the evidence across hundreds of changes into a
weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights represent
the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a
lexical semantic change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical
semantic influence, distinguishing leaders from followers, as well as others
who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through this period. More
specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women -- THE PROVINCIAL
FREEMAN and THE LILY -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus,
lending additional credence to the argument that a multiracial coalition of
women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both thought and action. It
also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought to
tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage
movement, and the vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07538v1
"Orbital Evolution of Equal-mass Eccentric Binaries due to a Gas Disk:
  Eccentric Inspirals and Circular Outspirals",2021-03-16T18:00:17Z,"Daniel J. D'Orazio, Paul C. Duffell","We solve the equations of two-dimensional hydrodynamics describing a
circumbinary disk accreting onto an eccentric, equal-mass binary. We compute
the time rate of change of the binary semimajor axis $a$ and eccentricity $e$
over a continuous range of eccentricities spanning $e=0$ to $e=0.9$. We find
that binaries with initial eccentricities $e_0 \lesssim 0.1$ tend to $e=0$,
where the binary semimajor axis expands. All others are attracted to $e \approx
0.4$, where the binary semimajor axis decays. The $e \approx 0.4$ attractor is
caused by a rapid change in the disk response from a nearly origin-symmetric
state to a precessing asymmetric state. The state change causes the time rates
of change $\dot{a}$ and $\dot{e}$ to steeply change sign at the same critical
eccentricity resulting in an attracting solution where $\dot{a} = \dot{e} = 0$.
This does not, however, result in a stalled, eccentric binary. The
finite-transition time between disk states causes the binary eccentricity to
evolve beyond the attracting eccentricity in both directions resulting in
oscillating orbital parameters and a drift of the semimajor axis. For the
chosen disk parameters, binaries with $e_0 \gtrsim 0.1$ evolve toward and then
oscillate around $e \approx 0.4$ where they shrink in semimajor axis. Because
unequal mass binaries grow toward equal mass through preferential accretion,
our results are applicable to a wide range of initial binary mass ratios.
Hence, these findings merit further investigations of this disk transition;
understanding its dependence on disk parameters is vital for determining the
fate of binaries undergoing orbital evolution with a circumbinary disk.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09251v2
"Temporal Cluster Matching for Change Detection of Structures from
  Satellite Imagery",2021-03-17T17:20:16Z,"Caleb Robinson, Anthony Ortiz, Juan M. Lavista Ferres, Brandon Anderson, Daniel E. Ho","Longitudinal studies are vital to understanding dynamic changes of the
planet, but labels (e.g., buildings, facilities, roads) are often available
only for a single point in time. We propose a general model, Temporal Cluster
Matching (TCM), for detecting building changes in time series of remotely
sensed imagery when footprint labels are observed only once. The intuition
behind the model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and
outside of building's footprint will change when a building is constructed (or
demolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may
look similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.
Similarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different
from the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a
heuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to
be applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit
the parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from
2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a
dataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our
results show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed
heuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised
versions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.
Finally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data
augmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure
footprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple
points in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the
spatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change
detection task.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09787v2

science alert in 2017. We carried out optical and near-infrared photometric,
and optical spectroscopic observations to understand the light variations. The
light curves show that V555 Ori was faint before 2017, entered a high state for
about a year, and returned to the faint state by mid-2018. In addition to the
long-term flux evolution, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations were also
evident, with a period of about 5 days. At optical wavelengths both the
long-term and short-term variations exhibited colourless changes, while in the
near-infrared they were consistent with changing extinction. We explain the
brightness variations as the consequence of changing extinction. The object has
a low accretion rate whose variation in itself would not be enough to reproduce
the optical flux changes. This behaviour makes V555 Ori similar to the pre-main
sequence star AA Tau, where the light changes are interpreted as periodic
eclipses of the star by a rotating inner disc warp. The brightness maximum of
V555 Ori was a moderately obscured ($A_V$=2.3 mag) state, while the extinction
in the low state was $A_V$=6.4 mag. We found that while the Gaia alert hinted
at an accretion burst, V555 Ori is a standard dipper, similar to the prototype
AA Tau. However, unlike in AA Tau, the periodic behaviour was also detectable
in the faint phase, implying that the inner disc warp remained stable in both
the high and low states of the system.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10313v2

overdose effects. The most common form of toxic effects of APAP is in the liver
where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane with
additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects
of APAP on pure phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used
DOPC, a commonly found phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes to synthesize
large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation of APAP changes
pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different
concentrations. We used a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS),
small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), cryo TEM for structural

bilayer significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms
of its morphology as well as influences the lipid content in the bilayer,
causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We discussed how the overall impact of
APAP molecules on the pure lipid membrane may play a significant role in the
drug's mechanisms of action. Our results showed the incorporation of APAP
reduces membrane rigidity as well as changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles
into much more irregularly shaped vesicles. Although bilayer structure did not
show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM results showed the
lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer which causes the

to 5.12 microns show that between 2012 and 2017 the region poleward of the
Saturn's northern hexagon changed from dark blue/green to a moderately brighter
gold color, except for the inner eye region (88.2 deg - 90 deg N), which
remained relatively unchanged. These and even more dramatic near-IR changes can
be reproduced by an aerosol model of four compact layers consisting of a
stratospheric haze at an effective pressure near 50 mbar, a deeper haze of
putative diphosphine particles typically near 300 mbar, an ammonia cloud layer
with a base pressure between 0.4 bar and 1.3 bar, and a deeper cloud of a
possible mix of NH4SH and water ice particles within the 2.7 to 4.5 bar region.
Our analysis of the background clouds between the discrete features shows that
between 2013 and 2016 the effective pressures of most layers changed very
little, except for the ammonia ice layer, which decreased from about 1 bar to
0.4 bar near the edge of the eye, but increased to 1 bar inside the eye. Inside
the hexagon there were large increases in optical depth, by up to a factor of
10 near the eye for the putative diphosphine layer and by a factor of four over
most of the hexagon interior. Inside the eye, aerosol optical depths were very
low, suggesting downwelling motions. The high contrast between eye and
surroundings in 2016 was due to substantial increases in optical depths outside
the eye. The color change from blue/green to gold inside most of the hexagon
region can be explained in our model almost entirely by changes in the
stratospheric haze, which increased between 2013 and 2016 by a factor of four
in optical depth and by almost a factor of three in the short-wavelength peak

bodies. Prime space weathering agents are solar wind irradiation and
micrometeoroid bombardment. These processes alter planetary reflectance spectra
and often modify their compositional diagnostic features. In this work we
focused on simulating and comparing the spectral changes caused by solar wind
irradiation and by micrometeoroid bombardment to gain a better understanding of
these individual space weathering processes. We used olivine and pyroxene
pellets as proxies for planetary materials. To simulate solar wind irradiation
we used hydrogen, helium, and argon ions with energies from 5 to 40 keV and
fluences of up to $10^{18}$ particles/cm$^2$. To simulate micrometeoroid
bombardment we used individual femtosecond laser pulses. We analysed the
corresponding evolution of different spectral parameters, which we determined
by applying the Modified Gaussian Model, and we also conducted principal
component analysis. The original mineralogy of the surface influences the
spectral evolution more than the weathering agent, as seen from the diverse
evolution of the spectral slope of olivine and pyroxene upon irradiation. The
spectral slope changes seen in olivine are consistent with observations of
A-type asteroids, while the moderate to no slope changes observed in pyroxene
are consistent with asteroid (4) Vesta. We also observed some differences in
the spectral effects induced by the two weathering agents. Ions simulating
solar wind have a smaller influence on longer wavelengths of the spectra than
laser irradiation simulating micrometeoroid impacts. This is most likely due to
the different penetration depths of ions and laser pulses. Our results suggest
that in some instances it might be possible to distinguish between the
contributions of the two agents on a weathered surface.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00870v1

regularization technique to determine sharp changes in Earth's seismic velocity
structure using arrival time data of direct waves. Our approach focuses on the
ability to better image two common features that are observed in Earth's
seismic velocity structure: sharp changes in velocities that correspond to
material boundaries, such as the Conrad and Moho discontinuities; and gradual
changes in velocity that are associated with pressure and temperature
distributions in the crust and mantle. We employ different penalty terms in the
vertical and horizontal directions to refine the earthquake tomography. We
utilize a vertical-direction (depth) penalty that takes the form of the l1-sum
of the l2-norms of the second-order differences of the horizontal units in the
vertical direction. This penalty is intended to represent sharp velocity
changes caused by discontinuities by creating a piecewise linear depth profile
of seismic velocity. We set a horizontal-direction penalty term on the basis of
the l2-norm to express gradual velocity tendencies in the horizontal direction,
which has been often used in conventional tomography methods. We use a
synthetic data set to demonstrate that our method provides significant
improvements over velocity structures estimated using conventional methods by
obtaining stable estimates of both steep and gradual changes in velocity.
Furthermore, we apply our proposed method to real seismic data in central Japan

monthly movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004--2006 and
2015--2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of the network has
changed. Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy--makers
directly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn
could impact policy--makers and their assessment of risk. Four general network
measures are used (total number of nodes with movements, movements, births and
deaths), in conjunction with network metrics to describe each monthly network.
Two updates of the database were examined to determine by how much the movement
data stored for a particular time period had been cleansed between updates.
Statistical models show that there is a statistically significant effect of the
time period (2004--2006 vs 2015--2017) in the values of all network measures
and six of nine network metrics. Changes in the sizes of both the Giant and
Weakly Strongly Connected components predict reductions in the upper and lower
bounds of the maximum epidemic size. Examination of the updates of the database
show that there are differences in records between updates and therefore
evidence of historical data changing between updates. Accurate modelling of

by a topology change at density $n_{1/2}\gsim 2 n_0$ can have a surprising
consequence, so far unrecognized in nuclear physics and astrophysics
communities, on the structure of dense compact-star matter. The topology
change, when translated into nuclear EFT with ""effective"" QCD degrees of
freedom in terms of hidden local and scale symmetries duly taken into account,
predicts an EoS that is soft below and stiff above $n\gsim n_{1/2}$, involving
no low-order phase transitions, and yields the macrophysical properties of
neutron stars consistent -- so far with no tension -- with the astrophysical
observations, including the maximum mass $ 2.0\lsim M/ M_\odot\lsim 2.2$ as
well as the GW data. Furthermore it describes the interior core of the massive
stars populated by baryon-charge-fractionalized quasi-fermions that are neither
baryonic nor quarkonic. It is argued that the cusp ""buried"" in the symmetry
energy resulting from strong correlations with hidden heavy degrees of freedom
leads, at $n\gsim n_{1/2}$, to what we dubbed ""pseudo-conformal"" sound speed,
$v^2_{pcs}/c^2\approx 1/3$, precociously converged from below at $n_{1/2}$. It
is not strictly conformal since the trace of energy-momentum tensor is not zero

"Sirius: Static Program Repair with Dependence Graph-Based Systematic
  Edit Patterns",2021-07-09T06:15:58Z,"Kunihiro Noda, Haruki Yokoyama, Shinji Kikuchi","Software development often involves systematic edits, similar but
nonidentical changes to many code locations, that are error-prone and laborious

past code changes enable us to detect and repair overlooked buggy code that
requires systematic edits.
  A recent study presented a promising SEP mining technique that is based on
program dependence graphs (PDGs), while traditional approaches leverage
syntax-based representations. PDG-based SEPs are highly expressive and can
capture more meaningful changes than syntax-based ones. The next challenge to
tackle is to apply the same code changes as in PDG-based SEPs to other code
locations; detection and repair of overlooked locations that require systematic
edits. Existing program transformation techniques cannot well address this
challenge because (1) they expect many structural code similarities that are
not guaranteed in PDG-based SEPs or (2) they work on the basis of PDGs but are
limited to specific domains (e.g., API migrations).
  We present in this paper a general-purpose program transformation algorithm
for applying PDG-based SEPs. Our algorithm identifies a small transplantable
structural subtree for each PDG node, thereby adapting code changes from
PDG-based SEPs to other locations. We construct a program repair pipeline

upon solute addition, and depends on the solute concentration. We discuss two
prototypical aqueous salt solutions, NaI(aq) and tetrabutylammonium iodide,
TBAI(aq), with the latter being a strong surfactant. Considerably different
behavior is revealed: In the NaI(aq) solutions, water's 1b1 energy increases by
300 meV upon increasing the concentration near-saturation concentrations,
whereas for TBAI the energy decreases by about 0.7 eV upon formation of a
surface layer. The solute-induced effects on the solute binding energies are
quantified as well, as inferred from concentration-dependent energy shifts of
the I- 5p peak energy. For NaI(aq), an almost identical I- 5p shift is found as
for the water 1b1 binding energy, with a larger shift occurring in the opposite
direction for the TBAI(aq) solution. We show that this result in NaI(aq) can be
primarily assigned to a change of water's electronic structure in the solution
bulk. In contrast, apparent changes of the 1b1 energy for TBAI(aq) can be
related to changes of the solution work function which could arise from surface
molecular dipoles. Furthermore, for both of the solutions studied here, the
measured water 1b1 binding energies can be correlated with the extensive
solution molecular structure changes occurring at high salt concentrations,
where in the case of NaI(aq), too few water molecules exist to hydrate
individual ions and the solution adopts a crystalline-like phase. We also
comment on the concentration-dependent shape of the 3a1 orbital of liquid water

to shed light on the contribution of the disk to these changes, especially
those related to the long cycle, occurring on timescales of hundreds of days.
We studied I-band OGLE photometric times series spanning 18.5 years,
constructing disk models by analyzing the orbital light curve at 52 consecutive
epochs. An optimized simplex algorithm was used to solve the inverse problem by
adjusting the light curve with the best stellar-orbital-disk parameters for the
system. We applied principal components analysis to the parameters to evaluate
their dependence and variability. We constructed a description of the mass
transfer rate in terms of disk parameters. We find that the light variability
can be understood in terms of a variable mass transfer rate and variable
accretion disk. The system brightness at orbital phase 0.25 follows the long
cycle and is correlated with the mass transfer rate and the disk thickness. The
long-cycle brightness variations can be understood in terms of differential
occultation of the hotter star by a disk of variable thickness. Our model fits
the overall light curve during 18.5 years well, including epochs of reversal of
main and secondary eclipse depths. The disk radius cyclically change around the
tidal radius, decoupled from changes in the mass transfer rate or system
brightness, suggesting that viscous delay might explain the non-immediate

for automated scoring mechanisms. We use this to investigate the
oversensitivity i.e., large change in output score with a little change in
input essay content) and overstability i.e., little change in output scores
with large changes in input essay content) of AES. Our results indicate that
autoscoring models, despite getting trained as ""end-to-end"" models with rich
contextual embeddings such as BERT, behave like bag-of-words models. A few
words determine the essay score without the requirement of any context making
the model largely overstable. This is in stark contrast to recent probing
studies on pre-trained representation learning models, which show that rich
linguistic features such as parts-of-speech and morphology are encoded by them.
Further, we also find that the models have learnt dataset biases, making them
oversensitive. To deal with these issues, we propose detection-based protection
models that can detect oversensitivity and overstability causing samples with
high accuracies. We find that our proposed models are able to detect unusual
attribution patterns and flag adversarial samples successfully.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11728v3
"Multiscale mechanical model based on patient-specific geometry:
  application to early keratoconus development",2021-11-24T14:41:46Z,"ChloÃ© Giraudet, JÃ©rome Diaz, Patrick Le Tallec, Jean-Marc Allain","Keratoconus is a pathology of the cornea associated with a tissue thinning
and a weakening of its mechanical properties. However, it remains elusive which
aspect is the leading cause of the disease. To investigate this question, we
combined a multiscale model with a patient-geometry in order to simulate the
mechanical response of healthy and pathological corneas under intraocular
pressure. The constitutive behavior of the cornea is described through an
energy function which takes into account the isotropic matrix of the cornea,
the geometric structure of collagen lamellae and the quasi-incompressibility of
the tissue. A micro-sphere description is implemented to take into account the
typical features of the collagen lamellae as obtained experimentally, namely
their orientation, their stiffness and their dispersion, as well as the their
unfolding stretch, at which they start to provide a significant force. A set of
reference parameters is obtained to fit experimental inflation data of the
literature. We show that the most sensitive parameter is the unfolding stretch,
as a small variation of this parameter induces a major change in the corneal
apex displacement. The keratoconus case is then studied by separating the
impact of the geometry and the one of the mechanics. We computed the evolution
of the SimK (a clinical indicator of cornea curvature) and elevation maps: we
were able to reproduce the reported changes of SimK with pressure only by a
mechanical weakening, and not by a change in geomtry. More specifically, the
weakening has to target the lamellae and not the matrix. The mechanical
weakening leads to elevations close to early stage keratoconus, but our model
lacks the remodeling component to couple the change in mechanics with changes
in geometry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12520v1
Changing-look event in NGC 3516: continuum or obscuration variability?,2021-12-12T18:40:42Z,"Missagh Mehdipour, Gerard A. Kriss, Laura W. Brenneman, Elisa Costantini, Jelle S. Kaastra, Graziella Branduardi-Raymont, Laura Di Gesu, Jacobo Ebrero, Junjie Mao","The Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3516 has undergone major spectral changes in recent
years. In 2017 we obtained Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift observations during its
new low-flux state. Using these observations we model the spectral energy
distribution (SED) and the intrinsic X-ray absorption, and compare the results
with those from historical observations taken in 2006. We thereby investigate
the effects of the changing-look phenomenon on the accretion-powered radiation
and the ionized outflows. Compared to its normal high-flux state in 2006, the
intrinsic bolometric luminosity of NGC 3516 was lower by a factor of 4 to 8
during 2017. Our SED modeling shows a significant decline in the luminosity of
all the continuum components from the accretion disk and the X-ray source. As a
consequence, the reprocessed X-ray emission lines have also become fainter. The
Swift monitoring of NGC 3516 shows remarkable X-ray spectral variability on
short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We investigate whether this
variability is driven by obscuration or the intrinsic continuum. We find that
the new low-flux spectrum of NGC 3516, and its variability, do not require any
new or variable obscuration, and instead can be explained by changes in the
ionizing SED that result in lowering of the ionization of the warm-absorber
outflows. This in turn induces enhanced X-ray absorption by the warm-absorber
outflows, mimicking the presence of new obscuring gas. Using the response of
the ionized regions to the SED changes, we place constraints on their density
and location.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06297v1

systems, which must deal with the twin problems of appearance and viewpoint
change in an always changing world. This paper introduces Patch-NetVLAD, which
provides a novel formulation for combining the advantages of both local and
global descriptor methods by deriving patch-level features from NetVLAD
residuals. Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local
keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned
local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a
multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch
sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are
highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and
viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD outperforms both
global and local feature descriptor-based methods with comparable compute,
achieving state-of-the-art visual place recognition results on a range of
challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary
Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user
requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of
magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. By combining superior performance
with improved computational efficiency in a configurable framework,

intermolecular interactions across the lower critical solution temperature

However, Japan's experience during the 1990's changed the consensus view on
price of economists and central banks around the world. Facing deflation and
zero interest bound at the same time, Bank of Japan had difficulty in
conducting effective monetary policy. It made Japan's stagnation unusually
prolonged. Too low inflation which annoys central banks today is translated
into the ""Phillips curve puzzle"". In the US and Japan, in the course of
recovery from the Great Recession after the 2008 global financial crisis, the
unemployment rate had steadily declined to the level which was commonly
regarded as lower than the natural rate or NAIRU. And yet, inflation stayed
low. In this paper, we consider a minimal model of dual labor market to explore
what kind of change in the economy makes the Phillips curve flat. The level of
bargaining power of workers, the elasticity of the supply of labor to wage in
the secondary market, and the composition of the workforce are the main factors
in explaining the flattening of the Phillips curve. We argue that the changes
we consider in the model, in fact, has plausibly made the Phillips curve flat

studied for their phase stability for a wide temperature range (100 K to 2000
K). The equilibrium thermodynamic phases are determined by the changes in
enthalpy and entropy. The enthalpy changes at any temperature are simulated by
embedded atom method (EAM) potential based hybrid Monte Carlo molecular
dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. Configurational entropy was calculated by
quasichemical method. The EAM potentials were all calculated based on the
physical input parameters of elements like atomic volume, cohesive energy,
elastic constants etc. It was found that the MC/MD evolved equilibrium
structures and the degree of local chemical short-range order/clustering

The ordering transition temperature is close to 700 K, which is also
substantiated by the experimental powder X-ray diffractions done in synchrotron

Moreover, the modern rules of synaptic plasticity or interconnections weights
adaptation also do not provide grounding for the ability of neurons to adapt to
the ever-changing input signal intensity. While natural neuron synaptic growth
is precisely controlled and restricted by protein supply and recycling, weight
correction rules such as widely used STDP are efficiently unlimited in change
rate and scale. The present article introduces new mechanics of interconnection
between neuron firing rate homeostasis and weight change through STDP growth
bounded by abstract protein reserve, controlled by the intracellular

out the intense noise signals to help neurons keep a stable firing rate. We

Worst Smells and Their Worst Reasons,2021-03-17T09:45:08Z,"Davide Falessi, Rick Kazman","The aims of this paper are: 1) to identify ""worst smells"", i.e., bad smells
that never have a good reason to exist, 2) to determine the frequency,
change-proneness, and severity associated with worst smells, and 3) to identify
the ""worst reasons"", i.e., the reasons for introducing these worst smells in
the first place. To achieve these aims we ran a survey with 71 developers. We
learned that 80 out of 314 catalogued code smells are ""worst""; that is,
developers agreed that these 80 smells should never exist in any code base. We
then checked the frequency and change-proneness of these worst smells on 27
large Apache open-source projects. Our results show insignificant differences,
in both frequency and change proneness, between worst and non-worst smells.
That is to say, these smells are just as damaging as other smells, but there is
never any justifiable reason to introduce them. Finally, in follow-up phone
interviews with five developers we confirmed that these smells are indeed
worst, and the interviewees proposed seven reasons for why they may be
introduced in the first place. By explicitly identifying these seven reasons,
project stakeholders can, through quality gates or reviews, ensure that such

Coherence of oscillations in matter and supernova neutrinos,2021-03-18T10:31:44Z,"Yago P. Porto-Silva, Alexei Yu. Smirnov","We study the propagation coherence for neutrino oscillations in media with
different density profiles. For each profile, we find the dependence of the
coherence length, $L_{coh}$, on neutrino energy and address the issue of
correspondence of results in the distance and energy-momentum representations.
The key new feature in matter is existence of energy ranges with enhanced
coherence around the energies $E_0$ of ""infinite coherence"" at which $L_{coh}
\rightarrow \infty$. In the configuration space, the infinite coherence
corresponds to equality of the (effective) group velocities of the eigenstates.
In constant density medium, there is a unique $E_0$, which coincides with the
MSW resonance energy of oscillations of mass states and is close to the MSW
resonance energy of flavor states. In the case of massless neutrinos or
negligible masses in a very dense medium the coherence persists continuously.
In the adiabatic case, the infinite coherence is realized for periodic density
change. Adiabaticity violation changes the shape factors of the wave packets
(WPs) and leads to their spread. In a medium with sharp density changes
(jumps), splitting of the eigenstates occurs at crossing of each jump. We study
the increase of the coherence length in a single jump and periodic density
jumps - castle-wall (CW) profiles. For the CW profile, there are several $E_0$
corresponding to parametric resonances. We outlined applications of the results
for supernova neutrinos. In particular, we show that coherence between two
shock wave fronts leads to observable oscillation effects, and our analysis
suggests that the decoherence can be irrelevant for flavor transformations in
the central parts of collapsing stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10149v1

interference-aware pre-beamformer (analog beamformer) design for joint spatial
division and multiplexing (JSDM) which is a user-grouping based two-stage
beamforming method. Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) is
employed in uplink frequency-selective channels. First, unconstrained slowly
changing statistical analog beamformer of each group, namely, generalized
eigenbeamformer (GEB) which has strong interference suppression capability is
designed where the mutual information in reduced dimension is maximized. Then,
constant-modulus constrained approximations of unconstrained beamformer are
obtained by utilizing alternating minimization algorithms for fully connected
arrays and fixed subarrays. In addition, a dynamic subarray algorithm is
proposed where the connections between radio frequency (RF) chains and antennas
are changed with changing channel statistics. Convergence of the proposed
alternating minimization-based algorithms are provided along with their
complexity analysis. It is observed that additional complexity of proposed
algorithms is insignificant for the overall system design. Although most of the
interference is suppressed with the help of proposed constrained beamformers,
there may be some residual interference after the analog beamforming stage.
Therefore, linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) type digital beamformers,
which take the residual interference in reduced dimension into account, are
proposed instead of zero-forcing (ZF) type. Simulation results verify the
superiority of the proposed interference-aware constrained design over existing

countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly
by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a
substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with
mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media
sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated
lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media

the best overall performance, with the lowest insertion losses in both the
amorphous and crystalline states. We show that by growth crystallization tuning
at least four different coupling ratios can be reliably programmed into the
Sb$_2$S$_3$ directional couplers. We used this effect to design a 2-bit
tuneable Sb$_2$S$_3$ directional coupler with a dynamic range close to 32 dB.

Rectangular Flows for Manifold Learning,2021-06-02T18:30:39Z,"Anthony L. Caterini, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, Geoff Pleiss, John P. Cunningham","Normalizing flows are invertible neural networks with tractable
change-of-volume terms, which allow optimization of their parameters to be
efficiently performed via maximum likelihood. However, data of interest are
typically assumed to live in some (often unknown) low-dimensional manifold
embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. The result is a modelling
mismatch since -- by construction -- the invertibility requirement implies
high-dimensional support of the learned distribution. Injective flows, mappings
from low- to high-dimensional spaces, aim to fix this discrepancy by learning
distributions on manifolds, but the resulting volume-change term becomes more
challenging to evaluate. Current approaches either avoid computing this term
entirely using various heuristics, or assume the manifold is known beforehand
and therefore are not widely applicable. Instead, we propose two methods to
tractably calculate the gradient of this term with respect to the parameters of
the model, relying on careful use of automatic differentiation and techniques
from numerical linear algebra. Both approaches perform end-to-end nonlinear
manifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto this manifold.
We study the trade-offs between our proposed methods, empirically verify that
we outperform approaches ignoring the volume-change term by more accurately
learning manifolds and the corresponding distributions on them, and show
promising results on out-of-distribution detection. Our code is available at

  Tracking Under Wind Disturbances and In-Flight Dynamics Changes",2021-06-07T09:40:23Z,"Abdulaziz Y. Alkayas, Mohamad Chehadeh, Abdulla Ayyad, Yahya Zweiri","The demand for accurate and fast trajectory tracking for multirotor Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics
technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is
required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios
like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes.
In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on
identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks
with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a
linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback
linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of
different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the
non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between
performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for
the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We
demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of
experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite
significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application
of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to
obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is
beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based
planning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of $3.59 \; cm$ when
tracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on

observed at very high spatial resolution. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
has continuously observed the full Sun from space with multi-wavelength filters
since July 2010. In particular, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument takes high-cadence frames (45 seconds) of continuum intensity in
which solar granulation is visible. We aimed to follow the evolution of the
solar granules over an activity cycle and look for changes in their spatial
properties. We investigated the density of granules and their mean area derived
directly from the segmentation of deconvolved images from SDO/HMI. To perform
the segmentation, we define granules as convex elements of images. We measured
an approximately 2% variation in the density and the mean area of granules over
the cycle, the density of granules being greater at solar maximum with a
smaller granule mean area. The maximum density appears to be delayed by about
one year compared to classical activity indicators, such as the sunspot number.
We complemented this study with high-spatial-resolution observations obtained
with Hinode/SOTBFI (Solar Optical Telescope Broadband Filter Imager), which are
consistent with our results. The observed variations in solar granulation at
the disc centre reveal a direct insight into the change in the physical
properties that occur in the upper convective zone during a solar cycle. These
variations can be due to interactions between convection and magnetic fields,

criteria requires a new set of manually generated plans by planners to build a
new prediction model. In this work, we instead use consistent plans generated

consistent/unbiased plans by solving large-scale constrained optimization
problems sequentially. If the clinical criteria changes, a new training data

arbitrary time-dependent temperature and potential variation for a Brownian
particle is developed. It is shown that it is essential to consider the
underdamped dynamics for temperature-changing transitions. The ieq is
maintained by a time-dependent auxiliary position and momentum potential, which
can be calculated for given time-dependent transition protocols. Explicit
analytic results are derived for the work and heat statistics, energy, and
entropy changes for harmonic and non-harmonic trapping potential with arbitrary
time-dependent potential parameters and temperature protocols. Numerical
solutions of the corresponding Langevin dynamics are computed to confirm the
theoretical results. Although ieq transition of the reverse process is not the
time-reversal of the ieq transition of the forward process due to the
odd-parity of controlling parameters, their phase-space distribution functions
restore the time-reversal symmetry, and hence the energy and entropy changes of
the ieq of the reverse process are simply the negative of that of the forward
process. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to construct an ieq
transition that has zero entropy production at a finite transition rate, i.e.,
a fast ieq isentropic process, and is further demonstrated by explicit Langevin
dynamics simulations. Our theory provides fundamental building blocks for
designing controlled microscopic heat engine cycles. Implications for

early stages of Alzheimers disease. Detection and observation of the
hippocampus changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the onset of
Alzheimers disease leads to the faster preventive and therapeutic measures.
Objective: The aim of this study was the segmentation of the hippocampus in
magnetic resonance (MR) images of Alzheimers patients using deep machine
learning method. Methods: U-Net architecture of convolutional neural network
was proposed to segment the hippocampus in the real MRI data. The MR images of
the 100 and 35 patients available in Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative

performance of the proposed method was compared with manual segmentation by
measuring the similarity metrics. Results: The desired segmentation achieved
after 10 iterations. A Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 92.3%, sensitivity =

the one-loop level in the standard electroweak theory with on-shell

for on- and off-shell quarks and for all external and internal quark masses. We
show that there exist non-decoupling effects of the internal heavy top quark in
interactions with gravity. A naive argument taking account of the quark Yukawa
coupling suggests that the amplitude of the process d --> s + graviton in the
large top quark mass limit would possibly acquire an enhancement factor
$m_{t}^{2}/M_{W}^{2}$, where $m_{t}$ and $M_{W}$ are the top quark and the
W-boson masses, respectively. In practice this leading enhancement is absent in
the renormalized amplitude due to cancellation. Thus the non-decoupling of the
internal top quark takes place at the $O(1)$ level. The flavor-changing two-

which is used for a consistency-check of the aforementioned cancellation of the

look like a generalization of what we have in the case of pseudo-Riemannian

fixed by special gauge conditions on components of the metric tensor. The
problem is what boundary conditions should be imposed on the boundaries of
these regions and how they should be taken into account in the definition of

complex social environment towards a topic. Two factors often govern the
influence of stances in an online social network: endogenous influences driven
by an individual's innate beliefs through the agent's past stances and
exogenous influences formed by social network influence between users. Both
endogenous and exogenous influences offer important cues to user
susceptibility, thereby enhancing the predictive performance on stance changes
or flipping. In this work, we propose a stance flipping prediction problem to

influence each other through the social network structure.From data collected

further spin reorientation transitions at 15 K and 12 K. We observe a sizable
amount of low-temperature magnetocaloric effect in Ho$_5$Sn$_3$ with a maximum
value of entropy change $\Delta S$ = -9.5 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for an applied
field of $H$ = 50 kOe at around 30 K. The field hysteresis is almost zero above
15 K where magneto-caloric effect is important. Interestingly, $\Delta S$ is
found to change its sign from positive to negative as the temperature is
increased above about 8 K, which can be linked to the multiple spin
reorientation transitions. The signature of the metamagnetism is visible in the
$\Delta S$ versus $H$ plot. The magnetic ground-state, obtained from the
density functional theory based calculation, is susceptible to the effective
Coulomb interaction ($U_{\rm eff}$) between electrons. Depending upon the value
of $U_{\rm eff}$, the ground-state can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic.
The compound shows large relaxation (14\% change in magnetization in 60 min) in

Sequential Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks,2021-06-27T12:57:31Z,"Jianxin Chang, Chen Gao, Yu Zheng, Yiqun Hui, Yanan Niu, Yang Song, Depeng Jin, Yong Li","Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users' historical behaviors to
predict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main
challenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich
historical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they
cannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users'
dynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult
to capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we
propose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential
Recommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.
Specifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user
behaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences
into tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps
explicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the
interest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph
convolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It
dynamically fuses and extracts users' current activated core interests from
noisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public

significant performance gains of our proposed method compared to

satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework

the outcome of the multi-species streaming instability in detail, we perform a
large parameter study in terms of particle number, particle size distribution,
particle size range, initial metallicity and initial particle scale height. We
study vertically stratified systems and determine the metallicity threshold for
filament formation. We compare these with a system where the initial particle
distribution is unstratified and find that its evolution follows that of its
stratified counterpart. We find that change in particle number does not result
in significant variation in the efficiency and timing of filament formation. We
also see that there is no clear trend for how varying the size distribution in
combination with particle size range changes the outcome of the multi-species

the inclusion of a particle size distribution into streaming instability

The focus is on bilinear tensor product operators. A tensor product operator on

same pair of spaces to any Hilbert space factors into the composition of the
tensor product operator with a uniquely determined linear mapping on the target
space. There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type;
there is no ""the"" tensor product. Distinctly different tensor product operators
can be associated with different parts of a multipartite system without
difficulty. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables
is tensor product operator dependent. The same state in the target state space
can be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable
with respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished
relative to the others; the unitary operator used to construct a Bell state
from a pair of |0>'s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime
example. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type

NEUKONFIG: Reducing Edge Service Downtime When Repartitioning DNNs,2021-06-29T19:42:02Z,"Ayesha Abdul Majeed, Peter Kilpatrick, Ivor Spence, Blesson Varghese","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) may be partitioned across the edge and the cloud

determined based on operational conditions such as network speed. When
operational conditions change DNNs will need to be repartitioned to maintain
the overall performance. However, repartitioning using existing approaches,
such as Pause and Resume, will incur a service downtime on the edge. This paper
presents the NEUKONFIG framework that identifies the service downtime incurred
when repartitioning DNNs and proposes approaches for reducing edge service
downtime. The proposed approaches are based on 'Dynamic Switching' in which,
when the network speed changes and given an existing edge-cloud pipeline, a new
edge-cloud pipeline is initialised with new DNN partitions. Incoming inference
requests are switched to the new pipeline for processing data. Two dynamic
switching scenarios are considered: when a second edge-cloud pipeline is always
running and when a second pipeline is only initialised when the network speed
changes. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed to
demonstrate that Dynamic Switching reduces the downtime by at least an order of
magnitude when compared to a baseline using Pause and Resume that has a
downtime of 6 seconds. A trade-off in the edge service downtime and memory
required is noted. The Dynamic Switching approach that requires the same amount
of memory as the baseline reduces the edge service downtime to 0.6 seconds and
to less than 1 millisecond in the best case when twice the amount of memory as

persistent local change of state along the paths of the Compton recoil
electrons. Measurement of the individual scattering locations and angles,
deposited energies, and recoil electron directions allows using the kinematical
constraints of the 2-body Compton scattering process to perform a statistical
time-ordering of the scatterings, with a high probability of precisely
identifying where the gamma first interacted in the detector. In these cases
the Line-of-Response is measured with high resolution, determined by the
underlying physics processes and not the detector segmentation. There are
multiple such media that act through different mechanisms. As an example in
which the change of state is quantum-mechanical through a change in molecular
configuration, rather than thermodynamic, as in a bubble chamber, we present
simulations of a two-state photoswitchable organic dye, a `Switchillator', that
is activated to a fluorescent-capable state by the ionization of the recoil
electrons. The activated state is persistent, and can be optically excited
multiple times to image individual activated molecules. Energy resolution is
provided by counting the activated molecules. Location along the LOR is
implemented by large-area time-of-flight MCP-PMT photodetectors with single
photon time resolution in the tens of ps and sub-mm spatial resolution.

1A~0535+262, which underwent the brightest giant outburst ever recorded for
this source from November to December 2020 with a peak luminosity of $1.2$
$\times10^{38}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$. Thanks to the unprecedented energy coverage
and high cadence observations provided by Insight-HXMT, we were able to find
for the first time evidence for a transition of the accretion regime. At high
luminosity, above the critical luminosity $6.7\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the
cyclotron absorption line energy anti-correlates with luminosity. Below the
critical luminosity, a positive correlation is observed. The 1A~0535+262
becomes, therefore, the second source after V~0332+53, which clearly shows an
anti-correlation above and transition between correlation and anti-correlation
around the critical luminosity. The evolution of both the observed CRSF line
energy and broadband X-ray continuum spectrum throughout the outburst exhibits
significant differences during the rising and fading phases: that is, for a
similar luminosity the spectral parameters take different values which results
in hysteresis patterns for several spectral parameters including the cyclotron
line energy. We argue that, similarly to V~0332+53, these changes might be
related to different geometry of the emission region in rising and declining
parts of the outburst, probably due to changes in the accretion disk structure
and its interaction with the magnetosphere of the neutron star.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02485v2
OHPL: One-shot Hand-eye Policy Learner,2021-08-06T22:09:14Z,"Changjae Oh, Yik Lung Pang, Andrea Cavallaro","The control of a robot for manipulation tasks generally relies on object
detection and pose estimation. An attractive alternative is to learn control
policies directly from raw input data. However, this approach is time-consuming
and expensive since learning the policy requires many trials with robot actions
in the physical environment. To reduce the training cost, the policy can be
learned in simulation with a large set of synthetic images. The limit of this
approach is the domain gap between the simulation and the robot workspace. In
this paper, we propose to learn a policy for robot reaching movements from a
single image captured directly in the robot workspace from a camera placed on
the end-effector (a hand-eye camera). The idea behind the proposed policy
learner is that view changes seen from the hand-eye camera produced by actions
in the robot workspace are analogous to locating a region-of-interest in a
single image by performing sequential object localisation. This similar view
change enables training of object reaching policies using
reinforcement-learning-based sequential object localisation. To facilitate the
adaptation of the policy to view changes in the robot workspace, we further
present a dynamic filter that learns to bias an input state to remove
irrelevant information for an action decision. The proposed policy learner can
be used as a powerful representation for robotic tasks, and we validate it on
static and moving object reaching tasks.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03318v1

  Disease Diagnosis",2021-08-10T10:06:54Z,"Changhyun Park, Heung-Il Suk","The identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stages using
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been attracting the attention
of researchers. Various data-driven approaches have been introduced to capture
subtle and local morphological changes of the brain accompanied by the disease
progression. One of the typical approaches for capturing subtle changes is
patch-level feature representation. However, the predetermined regions to
extract patches can limit classification performance by interrupting the
exploration of potential biomarkers. In addition, the existing patch-level
analyses have difficulty explaining their decision-making. To address these
problems, we propose the BrainBagNet with a position-based gate
(PG-BrainBagNet), a framework for jointly learning pathological region
localization and AD diagnosis in an end-to-end manner. In advance, as all scans
are aligned to a template in image processing, the position of brain images can
be represented through the 3D Cartesian space shared by the overall MRI scans.
The proposed method represents the patch-level response from whole-brain MRI
scans and discriminative brain-region from position information. Based on the
outcomes, the patch-level class evidence is calculated, and then the
image-level prediction is inferred by a transparent aggregation. The proposed
models were evaluated on the ADNI datasets. In five-fold cross-validation, the
classification performance of the proposed method outperformed that of the
state-of-the-art methods in both AD diagnosis (AD vs. normal control) and mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction (progressive MCI vs. stable
MCI) tasks. In addition, changes in the identified discriminant regions and

Potter, James F. Steiner, John A. Paice","The black-hole X-ray transient MAXI J1820+07 (=ASSASN-18ey) discovered in
March 2018 was one of the optically brightest ever seen, which has resulted in
very detailed optical outburst light-curves being obtained. We combine them
here with X-ray and radio light-curves to show the major geometric changes the
source undergoes. We present a detailed temporal analysis that reveals the
presence of remarkably high amplitude (>0.5 mag) modulations, which evolve from
the superhump (16.87 h) period towards the presumed orbital (16.45 h) period.
These modulations appear ~87d after the outburst began, and follow the
Swift/BAT hard X-ray light-curve, which peaks 4 days before the radio flare and
jet ejection, when the source undergoes a rapid hard to soft state transition.
The optical modulation then moves closer to the orbital period, with a light
curve peak that drifts slowly in orbital phase from ~0.8 to ~0.3 during the
soft state. We propose that the unprecedentedly large amplitude modulation
requires a warp in the disc in order to provide a large enough radiating area,
and for the warp to be irradiation-driven. Its sudden turn-on implies a change
in the inner disc geometry that raises the hard X-ray emitting component to a
height where it can illuminate the warped outer disc regions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05447v2
Flow-Aware Platoon Formation of Connected Automated Vehicles,2021-08-12T04:45:26Z,"Soomin Woo, Alexander Skabardonis","Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) bring promise of increasing traffic
capacity and energy efficiency by forming platoons with short headways on the
road. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because
the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing
the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve
this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other
CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons.
However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon
organization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more
lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive
Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated
with field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the
capacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below
capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the
flow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization
strategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the
local traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the
Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that
the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic
flow.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05530v1

make predictions on data whose distribution changes gradually along time,
leading to a drift between the train and test distributions. Such models are
often re-trained on new data periodically, and they hence need to generalize to
data not too far into the future. In this context, there is much prior work on
enhancing temporal generalization, e.g. continuous transportation of past data,
kernel smoothed time-sensitive parameters and more recently, adversarial
learning of time-invariant features. However, these methods share several
limitations, e.g, poor scalability, training instability, and dependence on
unlabeled data from the future. Responding to the above limitations, we propose
a simple method that starts with a model with time-sensitive parameters but
regularizes its temporal complexity using a Gradient Interpolation (GI) loss.
GI allows the decision boundary to change along time and can still prevent
overfitting to the limited training time snapshots by allowing task-specific
control over changes along time. We compare our method to existing baselines on
multiple real-world datasets, which show that GI outperforms more complicated
generative and adversarial approaches on the one hand, and simpler gradient
regularization methods on the other.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06721v2
Task-Sensitive Concept Drift Detector with Constraint Embedding,2021-08-16T09:10:52Z,"Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Barbara Hammer","Detecting drifts in data is essential for machine learning applications, as
changes in the statistics of processed data typically has a profound influence
on the performance of trained models. Most of the available drift detection
methods are either supervised and require access to the true labels during
inference time, or they are completely unsupervised and aim for changes in
distributions without taking label information into account. We propose a novel
task-sensitive semi-supervised drift detection scheme, which utilizes label
information while training the initial model, but takes into account that
supervised label information is no longer available when using the model during
inference. It utilizes a constrained low-dimensional embedding representation
of the input data. This way, it is best suited for the classification task. It
is able to detect real drift, where the drift affects the classification
performance, while it properly ignores virtual drift, where the classification
performance is not affected by the drift. In the proposed framework, the actual
method to detect a change in the statistics of incoming data samples can be
chosen freely. Experimental evaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with
different types of drift, demonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably
detect drifts, and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection

Binary (HMXB) pulsar Vela X-1 over a period of 46 yr. Our analysis indicates
nearly periodic variations in the spin period of the pulsar on time-scales of

pulsar though it is noticed that the source appears to stay near its
equilibrium period 283.4 s since MJD 51000, with rather erratic
spin-up/spin-down episodes around this value. Our study suggests nearly cyclic
turnover in the spin behaviour of the pulsar from spin-up to spin-down regimes

periodic variation in the spin behaviour of a wind-fed accreting pulsar. We
also observe erratic episodes of spin-up and spin-down behaviour on relatively
shorter time-scales which is a well known archetype of this wind-fed X-ray
pulsar. We investigate whether nearly periodic long-term spin period changes in

pursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and
more complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters
and an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep
architecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing
parameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep
and efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the
numerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution
consisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel
shuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In
terms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream
UNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep
encoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep
siamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly
representative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.
Subsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale
change information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross
self-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local
similar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,
thus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to
tackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions
based on information entropy are presented. On two challenging CD datasets, our
approach outperforms other SOTA FCN-based methods, with only benchmark-level

the context and the changing dynamics of HIV/AIDS during COVID-19 among the
Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh. What we currently observe is the
worst crisis in the Rohingya refugee camps thus far. Firstly, because of being
displaced, Rohingya refugees have increased vulnerability to HIV, as well as to
STIs and other poor health outcomes. Secondly, for the same reason, they have
inadequate access to HIV testing treatment and care. Not only because of their
refugee status but also because of the poor capacity of the host country to

behavioural factors exacerbate their dire situation with access to HIV testing,
treatment and care. And finally, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has
changed priorities in all societies, including the refugee camps. In the
context of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis, more emphasis is placed on COVID-19

  Sufficient Statistics Approach",2021-08-23T07:32:19Z,Egor Malkov,"This paper develops a framework for assessing the welfare effects of labor
income tax changes on married couples. I build a static model of couples' labor
supply that features both intensive and extensive margins and derive a
tractable expression that delivers a transparent understanding of how labor
supply responses, policy parameters, and income distribution affect the
reform-induced welfare gains. Using this formula, I conduct a comparative
welfare analysis of four tax reforms implemented in the United States over the
last four decades, namely the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. I find that these reforms
created welfare gains ranging from -0.16 to 0.62 percent of aggregate labor
income. A sizable part of the gains is generated by the labor force
participation responses of women. Despite three reforms resulted in aggregate
welfare gains, I show that each reform created both winners and losers.
Furthermore, I uncover two patterns in the relationship between welfare gains
and couples' labor income. In particular, the reforms of 1986 and 2017 display
a monotonically increasing relationship, while the other two reforms
demonstrate a U-shaped pattern. Finally, I characterize the bias in welfare
gains resulting from the assumption about a linear tax function. I consider a
reform that changes tax progressivity and show that the linearization bias is
given by the ratio between the tax progressivity parameter and the inverse
elasticity of taxable income. Quantitatively, it means that linearization
overestimates the welfare effects of the U.S. tax reforms by 3.6-18.1%.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09981v2

shifted to the manipulation of the location of these Weyl nodes for non-Abelian
braiding. To accomplish this braiding it is necessary to drive significant Weyl
node motion using realistic experimental parameter changes. We show that a
family of phase transitions characterized by certain symmetry constraints
impose that the Weyl nodes have to reorganise by a large amount, shifting from
one high symmetry plane to another. Additionally, for a subset of pairs of
nodes with nontrivial Euler class topology, this reorganization can only occur
through a braiding process with adjacent nodes. As a result, the Weyl nodes are
forced to move a large distance across the Brillouin zone and to braid, all
driven by small temperature changes, a process we illustrate with
Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$. Our work opens up routes to readily manipulate Weyl nodes

The Case for Task Sampling based Learning for Cluster Job Scheduling,2021-08-24T01:18:00Z,"Akshay Jajoo, Y. Charlie Hu, Xiaojun Lin, Nan Deng","The ability to accurately estimate job runtime properties allows a scheduler
to effectively schedule jobs. State-of-the-art online cluster job schedulers
use history-based learning, which uses past job execution information to
estimate the runtime properties of newly arrived jobs. However, with fast-paced
development in cluster technology (in both hardware and software) and changing
user inputs, job runtime properties can change over time, which lead to
inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore the potential and limitation
of real-time learning of job runtime properties, by proactively sampling and
scheduling a small fraction of the tasks of each job. Such a
task-sampling-based approach exploits the similarity among runtime properties
of the tasks of the same job and is inherently immune to changing job behavior.
Our study focuses on two key questions in comparing task-sampling-based
learning (learning in space) and history-based learning (learning in time): (1)
Can learning in space be more accurate than learning in time? (2) If so, can
delaying scheduling the remaining tasks of a job till the completion of sampled
tasks be more than compensated by the improved accuracy and result in improved
job performance? Our analytical and experimental analysis of 3 production
traces with different skew and job distribution shows that learning in space
can be substantially more accurate. Our simulation and testbed evaluation on
Azure of the two learning approaches anchored in a generic job scheduler using
3 production cluster job traces shows that despite its online overhead,
learning in space reduces the average Job Completion Time (JCT) by 1.28x,
1.56x, and 1.32x compared to the prior-art history-based predictor.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10464v2

of fields, from physics and chemistry to material science and biology. However,
a shortcoming of conventional pump-probe spectroscopy is that photoinduced

contribute to the measured differential spectra, leading to ambiguities in
assigning the origin of spectral signatures and ruling out quantitative
interpretation of the spectra. Ideally, these methods would measure the
underlying dielectric function (or the complex refractive index) which would
then directly provide quantitative information on the transient excited state
dynamics free of these ambiguities. Here we present and test a model
independent route to transform differential transmission or reflection spectra,
measured via conventional optical pump-probe spectroscopy, to changes in the
quantitative transient dielectric function. We benchmark this method against
changes in the real refractive index measured using time-resolved Frequency
Domain Interferometry in prototypical inorganic and organic semiconductor

glasses (MGs). The present understanding of how a small amount of alloying
element changes strength is that the additions lead to more efficient packing
of atoms and increased local topological order, which then increases the
barrier for shear transformations and the resistance to plastic deformation.
Here, we discover that minor alloying can improve the strength of MGs by
increasing the chemical bond strength alone and show that this strengthening is
distinct from changes in topological order. The results were obtained using
Al-Sm based MGs minor alloyed with transition metals (TMs). The addition of TMs
led to an increase in the hardness of the MGs which, however, could not be
explained based on changes in the topological ordering in the structure.
Instead we found that it was the strong bonding between TM and Al atoms which
led to a higher resistance to shear transformation that resulted in higher
strength and hardness, while the topology around the TM atoms had no influence
on their mechanical response. This finding demonstrates that the effects of
topology and chemistry on mechanical properties of MGs are independent of each
other and that they should be understood as separate, sometimes competing
mechanisms of strengthening. This understanding lays a foundation for design of
MGs with improved mechanical properties.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12028v1

model based on a higher-order network, and the effects of the regulation on
national economies and trade are estimated with an integrated shipping cost and
computable general equilibrium modeling framework. Then we use the Lorenz curve
to examine if the regulation generates risk or economic inequality among

which proves the effectiveness of the Convention. The Gini coefficient of 0.66
shows the inequality in risk changes relative to income levels among regions,
but risk reductions across all nations vary without particularly high risks for
SIDS and LDCs than for large economies. Similarly, we reveal inequality in
economic impacts relative to income levels (the Gini coefficient is 0.58), but
there is no evidence that SIDS and LDCs are disproportionately impacted
compared to more developed regions. Most changes in GDP, real exports, and real
imports of studied regions are minor (smaller than 0.1%). However, there are
more noteworthy changes for select sectors and trade partners including Togo,
Bangladesh, and Dominican Republic, whose exports may decrease for textiles and
metal and chemicals. We conclude the Convention decreases biological invasion
risk and does not generate disproportionate negative impacts on SIDS and LDCs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13315v1
"On the Origins and Relevance of the Equal Transit Time Fallacy to
  Explain Lift",2021-10-02T00:06:58Z,Graham Wild,"Recently, aerodynamics syllabi have changed in high schools, pilot ground
training, and even undergraduate physics. In contrast, there has been no change
in the basic theory taught to aeronautical or aerospace engineers. What has
changed is technology, both experimentally and computationally. The internet
and social media have also empowered citizen science such that the deficiencies
in the legacy physics education around flight and lift are well known. The
long-standing equal transit time (ETT) theory to explain lift has been proven
false. If incorrect, why was it ever taught? Through a historical analysis of
relevant fluid and aerodynamics literature, this study attempts to explain why
ETT theory is part of our collectively lower-level cognitive understanding of
lift and flight. It was found that in 1744 D'Alembert himself assumed this to
be a feature of moving fluids, and while this initial intuition (ETT 1.0) was
incorrect, the property of ETT (ETT 2.0) was derived in 1752 when applying
Newton's laws of motion to fluids. This incorrect result was independently
confirmed in 1757 by Euler! The conclusion is that an over simplified treatment
of fluids predicts ETT, along with no lift and drag. This then leads to the
open question, can ETT be taught at an appropriately low level as an
explanation for lift?",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00690v1
A slim disc approach to external photoevaporation of discs,2021-10-04T18:00:02Z,"James E Owen, Noumahn Altaf","The photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs by nearby massive stars present
in their birth cluster plays a vital role in their evolution. Previous
modelling assumes that the disc behaves like a classical Keplerian accretion
disc out to a radius where the photoevaporative outflow is launched. There is
then an abrupt change in the angular velocity profile, and the outflow is
modelled by forcing the fluid parcels to conserve their specific angular
momenta. Instead, we model externally photoevaporating discs using the slim
disc formalism. The slim disc approach self consistently includes the advection
of radial and angular momentum as well as angular momentum redistribution by
internal viscous torques. Our resulting models produce a smooth transition from
a rotationally supported Keplerian disc to a photoevaporative driven outflow,
where this transition typically occurs over ~4-5 scale heights. The penetration
of UV photons predominately sets the radius of the transition and the
viscosity's strength plays a minor role. By studying the entrainment of dust
particles in the outflow, we find a rapid change in the dust size and surface
density distribution in the transition region due to the steep gas density
gradients present. This rapid change in the dust properties leaves a
potentially observable signature in the continuum spectral index of the disc at
mm wavelengths. Using the slim disc formalism in future evolutionary
calculations will reveal how both the gas and dust evolves in their outer
regions and the observable imprints of the external photoevaporation process.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01630v1
"Design and Characterization of a 3D-printed Pneumatically-driven
  Bistable Valve with Tunable Characteristics",2021-10-04T23:25:10Z,"Sihan Wang, Liang He, Perla Maiolino","Although research studies in pneumatic soft robots develop rapidly, most
pneumatic actuators are still controlled by rigid valves and conventional
electronics. The existence of these rigid, electronic components sacrifices the
compliance and adaptability of soft robots.} Current electronics-free valve
designs based on soft materials are facing challenges in behaviour consistency,
design flexibility, and fabrication complexity. Taking advantages of soft
material 3D printing, this paper presents a new design of a bi-stable pneumatic
valve, which utilises two soft, pneumatically-driven, and
symmetrically-oriented conical shells with structural bistability to stabilise
and regulate the airflow. The critical pressure required to operate the valve
can be adjusted by changing the design features of the soft bi-stable
structure. Multi-material printing simplifies the valve fabrication, enhances
the flexibility in design feature optimisations, and improves the system
repeatability. In this work, both a theoretical model and physical experiments
are introduced to examine the relationships between the critical operating
pressure and the key design features. Results with valve characteristic tuning
via material stiffness changing show better effectiveness compared to the
change of geometry design features (demonstrated largest tunable critical
pressure range from 15.3 to 65.2 kPa and fastest response time $\leq$ 1.8 s.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01743v1
"Distribution Mismatch Correction for Improved Robustness in Deep Neural
  Networks",2021-10-05T11:36:25Z,"Alexander Fuchs, Christian Knoll, Franz Pernkopf","Deep neural networks rely heavily on normalization methods to improve their
performance and learning behavior. Although normalization methods spurred the
development of increasingly deep and efficient architectures, they also
increase the vulnerability with respect to noise and input corruptions. In most
applications, however, noise is ubiquitous and diverse; this can often lead to
complete failure of machine learning systems as they fail to cope with
mismatches between the input distribution during training- and test-time. The
most common normalization method, batch normalization, reduces the distribution
shift during training but is agnostic to changes in the input distribution
during test time. This makes batch normalization prone to performance
degradation whenever noise is present during test-time. Sample-based
normalization methods can correct linear transformations of the activation
distribution but cannot mitigate changes in the distribution shape; this makes
the network vulnerable to distribution changes that cannot be reflected in the
normalization parameters. We propose an unsupervised non-parametric
distribution correction method that adapts the activation distribution of each
layer. This reduces the mismatch between the training and test-time
distribution by minimizing the 1-D Wasserstein distance. In our experiments, we
empirically show that the proposed method effectively reduces the impact of
intense image corruptions and thus improves the classification performance
without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01955v1
"Runtime Interchange for Adaptive Re-use of Intelligent Cyber-Physical
  System Controllers",2021-09-24T01:08:25Z,"Hammond Pearce, Xin Yang, Srinivas Pinisetty, Partha S. Roop","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) such as those found within autonomous vehicles
are increasingly adopting Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based controllers. To
ensure the safety of these controllers, there is a spate of recent activity to
formally verify the ANN-based designs. There are two challenges with these
approaches: (1) The verification of such systems is difficult and time
consuming. (2) These verified controllers are not able to adapt to frequent
requirements changes, which are typical in situations like autonomous driving.
This raises the question: how can trained and verified controllers, which have
gone through expensive training and verification processes, be re-used to deal
with requirement changes? This paper addresses this challenge for the first
time by proposing a new framework that is capable of dealing with requirement
changes at runtime through a mechanism we term runtime interchange. Our
approach functions via a continual exchange and selection process of multiple
pre-verified controllers. It represents a key step on the way to
component-oriented engineering for intelligent designs, as it preserves the
behaviours of the original controllers while introducing additional
functionality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach we utilise an
existing autonomous driving case study as well as a set of smaller benchmarks.
These show that introduced overheads are extremely minimal and that the
approach is very scalable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01974v1
Haemodynamic analysis using multiphase flow dynamics in tubular lesions,2021-10-05T20:55:49Z,"Konstantinos G. Lyras, Jack Lee","Background and Objective: The role of red blood cell dynamics is emphasised
in certain cardiovascular diseases, and thus needs to be closely studied. A
multiphase model of blood flow allows the resolution of locally varying density
of red blood cells within a complex vessel geometrical domain, and haemodynamic
consequences of such build up. Methods: A novel computational fluid dynamics
solver for simulating multiphase flows is used for modelling blood flow using
level set for a sharp interface representation. Single-phase simulations and
reduced order models are used for pressure comparisons. The new solver is used
for numerically studying AHA type B lesions. The impact of hematocrit and
degree of stenosis on the haemodynamics of coronary arteries is investigated.
Results: The comparisons with single-phase flow simulations indicate
differences in pressure when considering red blood cell aggregation. Multiphase
simulations provide slightly lower pressure drop for the same stenosis severity
compared to the single-phase simulations. Secondary flow patterns and the
interactions between the two phases leads to the red blood cell aggregation at
the end of the diastole cycle, which significantly changes the red blood cell
distribution, the shear stresses and velocity in tubular lesions. Conclusions:
Neither pressure drop nor mean velocity are not strongly changed in the
multiphase modelling, but particle buildup significantly changes which is only
revealed by the multiphase approach.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02356v1
8-bit Optimizers via Block-wise Quantization,2021-10-06T15:43:20Z,"Tim Dettmers, Mike Lewis, Sam Shleifer, Luke Zettlemoyer","Stateful optimizers maintain gradient statistics over time, e.g., the
exponentially smoothed sum (SGD with momentum) or squared sum (Adam) of past
gradient values. This state can be used to accelerate optimization compared to
plain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be
allocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models
trained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use
8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit
optimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and
stability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise
quantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently
quantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster
optimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and
performance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes:
(1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for
both large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to
reduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of
input tokens in language models. As a result, our 8-bit optimizers maintain
32-bit performance with a small fraction of the memory footprint on a range of
tasks, including 1.5B parameter language modeling, GLUE finetuning, ImageNet
classification, WMT'14 machine translation, MoCo v2 contrastive ImageNet
pretraining+finetuning, and RoBERTa pretraining, without changes to the
original optimizer hyperparameters. We open-source our 8-bit optimizers as a
drop-in replacement that only requires a two-line code change.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02861v2

knowledge stored in the LMs can quickly become outdated as the world changes,
but it is non-trivial to avoid catastrophic forgetting and reliably acquire new
knowledge while preserving invariant knowledge. To push the community towards
better maintenance of ever-changing LMs, we formulate a new continual learning

strong baselines. Through extensive experiments, we find that CKL exhibits
unique challenges that are not addressed in previous CL setups, where parameter
expansion is necessary to reliably retain and learn knowledge simultaneously.
By highlighting the critical causes of knowledge forgetting, we show that CKL

  quarks",2021-10-11T17:59:53Z,Shyam Balaji,"Vector-like quarks have been of interest for a plethora of experimentally
motivated reasons and have come under increased investigation recently due to
their inclusion to the Standard Model (SM) appreciably improving global fits to
several flavour physics and precision electroweak measurements. The addition of
vector-like quark singlets breaks the unitarity of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and enables tree-level flavour changing
neutral (FCN) vertices. The resulting radiative flavour changing decays of
these particles through the electromagnetic transition dipole moment are a key
means to study their properties and search for them at experiments like the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Despite these radiative decays providing such a
clean experimental signature, an explicit analytical study of the branching
ratios and $CP$ violation resulting from these loop level processes has thus
far evaded attention. We provide the formulation for the decay rates and $CP$
asymmetry resulting from a combination of the imaginary components of the loop
integrals and complex phases in the quark mixing matrix. We then apply our
analytical results to study phenomenology of these states for several global
fits pertaining to vector-like isosinglets $t'$ and $b'$. We find that clean
collider signatures and polarisation observables can be generated for both $t'$
and $b'$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05473v2

this challenge, much work has studied automatically processing geospatial data
sources such as GPS trajectories and satellite images to reduce the cost of
maintaining digital maps. An end-to-end map update system would first process
geospatial data sources to extract insights, and second leverage those insights
to update and improve the map. However, prior work largely focuses on the first
step of this pipeline: these map extraction methods infer road networks from
scratch given geospatial data sources (in effect creating entirely new maps),
but do not address the second step of leveraging this extracted information to
update the existing digital map data. In this paper, we first explain why
current map extraction techniques yield low accuracy when extended to update
existing maps. We then propose a novel method that leverages the progression of
satellite imagery over time to substantially improve accuracy. Our approach
first compares satellite images captured at different times to identify
portions of the physical road network that have visibly changed, and then
updates the existing map accordingly. We show that our change-based approach

  Guarantees",2021-10-14T19:40:40Z,"Feisi Fu, Wenchao Li","We present a novel methodology for repairing neural networks that use ReLU
activation functions. Unlike existing methods that rely on modifying the
weights of a neural network which can induce a global change in the function
space, our approach applies only a localized change in the function space while
still guaranteeing the removal of the buggy behavior. By leveraging the
piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, our approach can efficiently
construct a patch network tailored to the linear region where the buggy input
resides, which when combined with the original network, provably corrects the
behavior on the buggy input. Our method is both sound and complete -- the
repaired network is guaranteed to fix the buggy input, and a patch is
guaranteed to be found for any buggy input. Moreover, our approach preserves
the continuous piecewise linear nature of ReLU networks, automatically
generalizes the repair to all the points including other undetected buggy
inputs inside the repair region, is minimal in terms of changes in the function
space, and guarantees that outputs on inputs away from the repair region are
unaltered. On several benchmarks, we show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing methods in terms of locality and limiting negative side

"Effect of Dust Size on the Near-Infrared Spectra (1.0-5.0 $Î¼$m) of
  Brown Dwarf Atmospheres",2021-10-19T02:41:11Z,"Satoko Sorahana, Hiroshi Kobayashi, Kyoko K. Tanaka","In this study, we demonstrate the dependence of atmospheric dust size on the
near-infrared spectra of ten L dwarfs, and constrain the sizes of dust grains
in each L dwarf atmosphere. In previous studies, by comparing observed and
modeled spectra, it was suggested that the deviations of their spectral shapes
from theoretical prediction are general characteristics. Here, we focus on the
dust size in brown dwarf atmospheres to understand the observed spectra. We
confirm that changing the dust size changes the temperature-pressure structure
of the atmosphere, with the shape of the spectrum changing accordingly. At the
wavelength at which dust is the main absorber of radiation (the dust-dominated
regime), a large dust opacity combined with a medium grain size, e.g., 0.1
$\mu$m, results in a low photospheric temperature, and thus a small flux.
Conversely, for the wavelength at which gas absorption is dominant (the
gas-dominated regime), a large dust opacity modifies the temperature-pressure
structure, resulting in a high photospheric temperature, which corresponds to
large flux emissions. Taking into account the size effect, we compare the model
spectral fluxes in the wavelength range 1-5 $\mu$m with the observational ones
to constrain the main dust size in the atmosphere of each of the ten L dwarfs
observed with AKARI and SpeX or CGS4. Ultimately, we reveal that the observed
data are reproduced with higher fidelity by models based on a medium dust size
of 0.1-3.0 $\mu$m for six of these L dwarfs; therefore, we suggest that such
atmospheric dust sizes apply to the majority of L dwarfs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09700v1
Hosting Capacity Approach Implications,2021-10-20T13:16:37Z,"Narayan Bhusal, Andrija Sadikovic, Mohammed Ben-Idris","This paper revisits the generation hosting capacity (HC) calculation approach
to account for grid operational flexibility--the ability to reconfigure the
system safely. In essence, the generation hosting capacity is determined
against the set of limiting factors--voltage, thermal (conductor loading),
reverse flow (at the feeder head, station transformer, or substation), and
change in the voltage (due to sudden change in generation output)). Not that
long ago, California Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) added a new criterion that
does not allow reverse flow at the supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) points that can change the system configuration, aiming to prevent the
potential transfer of reverse flow to an adjacent feeder. This new criterion
intended to capture operational constraints as part of hosting capacity-known
as hosting capacity with operational flexibility (OpFlex). This paper explores
the shortfalls of such an approach and proposes performing actual transfer
analysis when determining hosting capacity rather than implementing the OpFlex
approach. Furthermore, we discuss the need for transition to determining
hosting capacity profile (all intervals) rather than a flat line (one, worst
performing interval) hosting capacity. A hosting capacity profile would inform
the developers of interval-by-interval limits and opportunities, creating new
opportunities to reach higher penetration of DERs at a lower cost. With
technological and computational advancements, such an approach is neither out
of implementation reach nor that computationally expensive. In return, far more
DER can be interconnected once programmed not to violate certain generation
profiles as part of the interconnection requirement, and utilities would be
better informed of their actual operational flexibility, benefiting society

Flavor probes of axion-like particles,2021-10-20T18:00:03Z,"Martin Bauer, Matthias Neubert, Sophie Renner, Marvin Schnubel, Andrea Thamm","Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated low-energy relics
of high-energy extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We investigate the
phenomenology of an ALP with flavor-changing couplings, and present a
comprehensive analysis of quark and lepton flavor-changing observables within a
general ALP effective field theory. Observables studied include rare meson
decays, flavor oscillations of neutral mesons, rare lepton decays, and dipole
moments. We derive bounds on the general ALP couplings as a function of its
mass, consistently taking into account the ALP lifetime and branching ratios.
We further calculate quark flavor-changing effects that are unavoidably induced
by running and matching between the new physics scale and the scale of the
measurements. This allows us to derive bounds on benchmark ALP models in which
only a single (flavorless or flavor-universal) ALP coupling to SM particles is
present at the new physics scale, and in this context we highlight the
complementarity and competitiveness of flavor bounds with constraints derived
from collider, beam dump and astrophysical measurements. We find that searches
for ALPs produced in meson decays provide some of the strongest constraints in
the MeV-GeV mass range, even for the most flavorless of ALP models. Likewise,
we discuss the interplay of flavor-conserving and flavor-violating couplings of
the ALP to leptons, finding that constraints from lepton flavor-violating
observables generally depend strongly on both. Additionally, we analyze whether
an ALP can provide an explanation for various experimental anomalies including
those observed in rare B-meson decays, measurements at the ATOMKI and KTeV

observed X-ray spectrum, encoding important information about the disc
structure and density. A Type I X-ray burst will strongly irradiate the
accretion disc and alter its properties. Previous numerical simulations
predicted the evolution of the accretion disc due to an X-ray burst. Here, we
process time-averaged simulation data of six time intervals to track changes in
the reflection spectrum from the burst onset to just past its peak. We divide
the reflecting region of the disc within $r\lesssim50$ km into 6-7 radial zones
for every time interval and compute the reflection spectra for each zone. We
integrate these reflection spectra to obtain a total reflection spectrum per
time interval. The burst ionizes and heats the disc, which gradually weakens
all emission lines. Compton scattering and bremsstrahlung rates increase in the
disc during the burst rise, and the soft excess at $<$3 keV rises from
$\approx4$% to $\approx38$% of the total emission at the burst peak. A soft
excess is expected to be ubiquitous in the reflection spectra of X-ray bursts.
Structural disc changes such as inflation because of heating or drainage of the
inner disc due to Poynting-Robertson drag affect the strength of the soft
excess. Further studies on the dependence of the reflection spectrum
characteristics to changes in the accretion disc during an X-ray burst may lead
to probes of the disc geometry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11931v1

captures the spatial structures in images by identifying semantic regions (SRs)
and their spatial distributions, and is proved to be the key to modelling
subtle changes in images. We automatically identify these SRs by grouping the
detected keypoints in a given image. The ``usefulness'' of these SRs for image
recognition is measured using our innovative attentional mechanism focusing on

  Arena Game",2021-10-27T17:59:22Z,"Yuzi He, Christopher Tran, Julie Jiang, Keith Burghardt, Emilio Ferrara, Elena Zheleva, Kristina Lerman","The popularity of online gaming has grown dramatically, driven in part by
streaming and the billion-dollar e-sports industry. Online games regularly
update their software to fix bugs, add functionality that improve the game's
look and feel, and change the game mechanics to keep the games fun and
challenging. An open question, however, is the impact of these changes on
player performance and game balance, as well as how players adapt to these
sudden changes. To address these questions, we use causal inference to measure
the impact of software patches to League of Legends, a popular team-based
multiplayer online game. We show that game patches have substantially different
impacts on players depending on their skill level and whether they take breaks
between games. We find that the gap between good and bad players increases
after a patch, despite efforts to make gameplay more equal. Moreover, longer
between-game breaks tend to improve player performance after patches. Overall,
our results highlight the utility of causal inference, and specifically
heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, as a tool to quantify the complex
mechanisms of game balance and its interplay with players' performance.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14632v1
"Amplification of Primordial Perturbations from the Rise or Fall of the
  Inflaton",2021-10-27T18:00:00Z,"Keisuke Inomata, Evan McDonough, Wayne Hu","The next generation of cosmic microwave background, gravitational wave, and
large scale structure, experiments will provide an unprecedented opportunity to
probe the primordial power spectrum on small scales. An exciting possibility
for what lurks on small scales is a sharp rise in the primordial power
spectrum: This can lead to the formation of primordial black holes, providing a
dark matter candidate or the black holes observed by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration. In this work we develop a mechanism for the amplification of the
small-scale primordial power spectrum, in the context of single-field inflation
with a step-like feature in the inflaton potential. Specifically, we consider
both the upward and the downward step in the potential. We also discuss the
possibility of the strong coupling between perturbations because the rapid
changes of the potential derivatives with the time-dependent field value,
caused by the step-like feature, could make the coupling stronger. As a result,
we find that the perturbations can remain weakly coupled yet sufficiently
enhanced if the step realizes the rapid changes of the potential derivatives in
some fraction of an e-fold, $\mathcal O(\mathcal P_{\mathcal R}^{1/2}) \lesssim
\Delta N < 1$, where $\mathcal P_\mathcal R$ is the power spectrum of the
curvature perturbation at that time. We also discuss the PBH formation rate
from the inflaton trapping at the local minimum, which can occur in the
potential with an upward step.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14641v2

Nambu-Goldstone boson when the long-distance symmetry-breaking scales are
depleted controllably. We achieve this by studying the valence Parton
Distribution Function (PDF) of pion in 2+1 dimensional two-color QCD, with the
number $N$ of massless quarks as the tunable parameter that slides the theory
from being strongly broken for $N=0$ to the conformal window for $N>4$, where
the theory is gapped by the fixed finite volume. We perform our study
non-perturbatively using lattice simulations with $N=0,2,4,8$ flavors of nearly
massless two-component Wilson-Dirac sea quarks and employ the leading-twist
formalism (LaMET/SDF) to compute the PDF of pion at a fixed valence mass. We
find that the relative variations in the first few PDF moments are only mild
compared to the changes in decay constant, but the shape of the reconstructed
$x$-dependent PDF itself dramatically changes from being broad in the
scale-broken sector to being sharply peaked in the near-conformal region, best
reflected in PDF shape observables such as the cumulants.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02224v3

form of applications in future wireless networks. With the advancement of the
machine learning algorithms, the transmission scheme providing the best

equipped with self-decision mechanisms, where the interactions between each
agent are modeled in terms of service quality, security, and cost dimensions.
In this work, first, we provide network utility as a reliability metric, which
is a weighted sum of the individual utility values of the CCPS agents. The
individual utilities are calculated by mixing the quality of service (QoS),
security, and cost dimensions with the proportions determined by the
individualized user requirements. By changing the proportions, the CCPS network
can be tuned for different applications of next-generation wireless networks.
Then, we propose a secure transmission policy selection (STPS) mechanism that
maximizes the network utility by using the Markov-decision process (MDP). In
STPS, the CCPS network jointly selects the best performing physical layer
security policy and the parameters of the selected secure transmission policy
to adapt to the changing environmental effects. The proposed STPS is realized
by reinforcement learning (RL), considering its real-time decision mechanism

Bootstrapping Non-Stationary Stochastic Volatility,2021-01-10T15:04:28Z,"H. Peter Boswijk, Giuseppe Cavaliere, Anders Rahbek, Iliyan Georgiev","In this paper we investigate how the bootstrap can be applied to time series
regressions when the volatility of the innovations is random and
non-stationary. The volatility of many economic and financial time series
displays persistent changes and possible non-stationarity. However, the theory
of the bootstrap for such models has focused on deterministic changes of the
unconditional variance and little is known about the performance and the
validity of the bootstrap when the volatility is driven by a non-stationary
stochastic process. This includes near-integrated volatility processes as well
as near-integrated GARCH processes. This paper develops conditions for
bootstrap validity in time series regressions with non-stationary, stochastic
volatility. We show that in such cases the distribution of bootstrap statistics
(conditional on the data) is random in the limit. Consequently, the
conventional approaches to proving bootstrap validity, involving weak
convergence in probability of the bootstrap statistic, fail to deliver the
required results. Instead, we use the concept of `weak convergence in
distribution' to develop and establish novel conditions for validity of the
wild bootstrap, conditional on the volatility process. We apply our results to
several testing problems in the presence of non-stationary stochastic
volatility, including testing in a location model, testing for structural
change and testing for an autoregressive unit root. Sufficient conditions for
bootstrap validity include the absence of statistical leverage effects, i.e.,
correlation between the error process and its future conditional variance. The
results are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations, which indicate that the
wild bootstrap leads to size control even in small samples.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03562v1
Learn-n-Route: Learning implicit preferences for vehicle routing,2021-01-11T14:57:46Z,"Rocsildes Canoy, VÃ­ctor Bucarey, Jayanta Mandi, Tias Guns","We investigate a learning decision support system for vehicle routing, where
the routing engine learns implicit preferences that human planners have when
manually creating route plans (or routings). The goal is to use these learned
subjective preferences on top of the distance-based objective criterion in
vehicle routing systems. This is an alternative to the practice of
distinctively formulating a custom VRP for every company with its own routing
requirements. Instead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions
over similar sets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The learning
approach is based on the concept of learning a Markov model, which corresponds
to a probabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance
matrix. This nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in
creating the actual routings, and to optimize over both distances and
preferences at the same time. For the learning, we explore different schemes to
construct the probabilistic transition matrix that can co-evolve with changing
preferences over time. Our results on a use-case with a small transportation
company show that our method is able to generate results that are close to the
manually created solutions, without needing to characterize all constraints and
sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of changes in the customer sets,
our method is able to find solutions that are closer to the actual routings
than when using only distances, and hence, solutions that require fewer manual
changes when transformed into practical routings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03936v1

were made through the medium-band SED500 ({\lambda}5019/246 {\AA}) and
broadband r-sdss ({\lambda}6200/1200 {\AA}) filters with the multimode focal
reducer SCORPIO-2 at the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory (Russia). Dust in comet 2P/Encke was mainly concentrated in the
near-nucleus region of the coma: the maximum dust/gas ratios were 1.5 and 2.9
in the SED500 and the r-sdss filters near the nucleus but dropped sharply to
~0.2 and ~1 at the distance ~2500 km, respectively. Then these ratios began to
increase at distances ~12000 km from the nucleus, the ratio was ~0.3 (SED500)
and ~1.3 (r-sdds). There were significant variations of polarization over the
coma, which correlated with the variations in the dust color and dust/gas
ratio. Changes in polarization and color across the 2P/Encke coma indicate
changes in physical properties of the dust particles with the distance from the
nucleus. Our Sh-matrix computer simulations of light scattering by Gaussian
particles allow us to suggest that the observed trends in color and

narrow-line Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC 4748 using observations in the year 2017 and
2014 performed with AstroSat and XMM-Newton, respectively. Both observations
show extremely variable soft and hard X-ray emission that are correlated with
each other. In the 2014 data set, the source retains its general behaviour of
""softer when brighter"" while the 2017 observation exhibits a ""harder when
brighter"" nature. Such changing behaviour is rare in AGNs and is usually
observed in the black hole binary systems. The ""harder when brighter"" is
confirmed with the anti-correlation between the photon index and the 0.3-10 keV
power-law flux. This suggests a possible change in the accretion mode from
standard to the advection-dominated flow. Additionally, both the observations
show soft X-ray excess below 2 keV over the power-law continuum. This excess
was fitted with a single or multiple blackbody component(s). The origin of soft
excess during the 2017 observation is likely due to the cool Comptonization as
the photon index changes with time. On the other hand, the broad iron line and
delayed UV emission during the 2014 observation strongly suggest that X-ray
illumination onto the accretion disk and reflection and reprocessing play a
significant role in this AGN.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04546v1

changed the way many software development teams collaborate and communicate. To
investigate how team culture and team productivity may also have been affected,
we conducted two surveys at a large software company. The first, an exploratory
survey during the early months of the pandemic with 2,265 developer responses,
revealed that many developers faced challenges reaching milestones and that
their team productivity had changed. We also found through qualitative analysis
that important team culture factors such as communication and social connection
had been affected. For example, the simple phrase ""How was your weekend?"" had
become a subtle way to show peer support.
  In our second survey, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the team
cultural factors that emerged from our first survey to understand the
prevalence of the reported changes. From 608 developer responses, we found that
74% of these respondents missed social interactions with colleagues and 51%
reported a decrease in their communication ease with colleagues. We used data
from the second survey to build a regression model to identify important team
culture factors for modeling team productivity. We found that the ability to
brainstorm with colleagues, difficulty communicating with colleagues, and
satisfaction with interactions from social activities are important factors
that are associated with how developers report their software development

"Coarse Temporal Attention Network (CTA-Net) for Driver's Activity
  Recognition",2021-01-17T10:15:37Z,"Zachary Wharton, Ardhendu Behera, Yonghuai Liu, Nik Bessis","There is significant progress in recognizing traditional human activities
from videos focusing on highly distinctive actions involving discriminative
body movements, body-object and/or human-human interactions. Driver's
activities are different since they are executed by the same subject with
similar body parts movements, resulting in subtle changes. To address this, we
propose a novel framework by exploiting the spatiotemporal attention to model
the subtle changes. Our model is named Coarse Temporal Attention Network
(CTA-Net), in which coarse temporal branches are introduced in a trainable
glimpse network. The goal is to allow the glimpse to capture high-level
temporal relationships, such as 'during', 'before' and 'after' by focusing on a
specific part of a video. These branches also respect the topology of the
temporal dynamics in the video, ensuring that different branches learn
meaningful spatial and temporal changes. The model then uses an innovative
attention mechanism to generate high-level action specific contextual
information for activity recognition by exploring the hidden states of an LSTM.
The attention mechanism helps in learning to decide the importance of each
hidden state for the recognition task by weighing them when constructing the
representation of the video. Our approach is evaluated on four publicly
accessible datasets and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by a
considerable margin with only RGB video as input.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06636v1

in time-varying complex multipath environments, such as dense urban areas and
indoors, where GPS and model-based localization techniques come short. We
consider the angle-delay profile (ADP), a linear transformation of channel
state information (CSI), in massive MIMO systems and show that ADPs preserve
users' motion when stacked temporally. We discuss that given a static
environment, future frames of ADP time-series are predictable employing a video
frame prediction algorithm. We express that a deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) can be employed to learn the background static scattering environment.
To detect foreground changes in the environment, corresponding to path blockage
or addition, we introduce an algorithm taking advantage of the trained DCNN.
Furthermore, we present DyLoc, a data-driven framework to recover distorted
ADPs due to foreground changes and to obtain precise location estimations. We
evaluate the performance of DyLoc in several dynamic scenarios employing
DeepMIMO dataset to generate geo-tagged CSI datasets for indoor and outdoor
environments. We show that previous DCNN-based techniques fail to perform with
desirable accuracy in dynamic environments, while DyLoc pursues localization
precisely. Moreover, simulations show that as the environment gets richer in
terms of the number of multipath, DyLoc gets more robust to foreground changes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07848v2
Influence Estimation for Generative Adversarial Networks,2021-01-20T23:55:54Z,"Naoyuki Terashita, Hiroki Ohashi, Yuichi Nonaka, Takashi Kanemaru","Identifying harmful instances, whose absence in a training dataset improves
model performance, is important for building better machine learning models.
Although previous studies have succeeded in estimating harmful instances under
supervised settings, they cannot be trivially extended to generative
adversarial networks (GANs). This is because previous approaches require that
(1) the absence of a training instance directly affects the loss value and that
(2) the change in the loss directly measures the harmfulness of the instance
for the performance of a model. In GAN training, however, neither of the
requirements is satisfied. This is because, (1) the generator's loss is not
directly affected by the training instances as they are not part of the
generator's training steps, and (2) the values of GAN's losses normally do not
capture the generative performance of a model. To this end, (1) we propose an
influence estimation method that uses the Jacobian of the gradient of the
generator's loss with respect to the discriminator's parameters (and vice
versa) to trace how the absence of an instance in the discriminator's training
affects the generator's parameters, and (2) we propose a novel evaluation
scheme, in which we assess harmfulness of each training instance on the basis
of how GAN evaluation metric (e.g., inception score) is expect to change due to
the removal of the instance. We experimentally verified that our influence
estimation method correctly inferred the changes in GAN evaluation metrics.
Further, we demonstrated that the removal of the identified harmful instances
effectively improved the model's generative performance with respect to various
GAN evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08367v3
Customer Price Sensitivities in Competitive Automobile Insurance Markets,2021-01-21T11:07:20Z,Robert Matthijs Verschuren,"Insurers are increasingly adopting more demand-based strategies to
incorporate the indirect effect of premium changes on their policyholders'
willingness to stay. However, since in practice both insurers' renewal premia
and customers' responses to these premia typically depend on the customer's
level of risk, it remains challenging in these strategies to determine how to
properly control for this confounding. We therefore consider a causal inference
approach in this paper to account for customers' price sensitivity and to
deduce optimal, multi-period profit maximizing premium renewal offers. More
specifically, we extend the discrete treatment framework of Guelman and
Guill\'en (2014) by Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, and by multiple
imputation to better account for the uncertainty in the counterfactual
responses. We additionally introduce the continuous treatment framework with
XGBoost to the insurance literature to allow identification of the exact
optimal renewal offers and account for any competition in the market by
including competitor offers. The application of the two treatment frameworks to
a Dutch automobile insurance portfolio suggests that a policy's competitiveness
in the market is crucial for a customer's price sensitivity and that XGBoost is
more appropriate to describe this than the traditional logistic regression.
Moreover, an efficient frontier of both frameworks indicates that substantially
more profit can be gained on the portfolio than realized, also already with
less churn and in particular if we allow for continuous rate changes. A
multi-period renewal optimization confirms these findings and demonstrates that
the competitiveness enables temporal feedback of previous rate changes on
future demand.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08551v2

"Enhancing the formation of ionic defects to study the ice Ih/XI
  transition with molecular dynamics simulations",2021-01-22T19:49:43Z,"Pablo M. Piaggi, Roberto Car","Ice Ih, the common form of ice in the biosphere, contains proton disorder.
Its proton-ordered counterpart, ice XI, is thermodynamically stable below 72 K.
However, even below this temperature the formation of ice XI is kinetically
hindered and experimentally it is obtained by doping ice with KOH. Doping
creates ionic defects that promote the migration of protons and the associated
change in proton configuration. In this article, we mimic the effect of doping
in molecular dynamics simulations using a bias potential that enhances the
formation of ionic defects. The recombination of the ions thus formed proceeds
through fast migration of the hydroxide and results in the jump of protons
along a hydrogen bond loop. This provides a physical and expedite way to change
the proton configuration, and to accelerate diffusion in proton configuration
space. A key ingredient of this approach is a machine learning potential
trained with density functional theory data and capable of modeling molecular
dissociation. We exemplify the usefulness of this idea by studying the
order-disorder transition using an appropriate order parameter to distinguish
the proton environments in ice Ih and XI. We calculate the changes in free
energy, enthalpy, and entropy associated with the transition. Our estimated
entropy agrees with experiment within the error bars of our calculation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09308v2

Human Inference in Changing Environments With Temporal Structure,2021-01-27T00:31:46Z,"Arthur Prat-Carrabin, Robert C. Wilson, Jonathan D. Cohen, Rava Azeredo da Silveira","To make informed decisions in natural environments that change over time,
humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies
exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have
focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are
history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields
history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes
depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We
investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point
inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine
aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans
behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away
from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that
their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this
variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To
elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a
broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of
suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with 'output
noise' that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates,
human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which
the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented
through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes
to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning
in humans.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11143v1

the exponential function. It was observed that the distributions contain
several $p_T$ regions similar to the cases with the charged particles, $\pi^0$-
and $\eta$- mesons produced in the same events. These regions could be
characterized using three variables: the length of the region $L^{c}_K $ and
free fitting parameters $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $. It was observed that the
values of the parameters as a function of energy grouped around certain lines
and there are jump-like changes. These observations together with the effect of
existing the several $p_T$ regions can say on discrete energy dependencies for
the $L^{c}_K $ , $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $. The lengths of the regions increase
with the mass of the particles. This increase gets stronger with energy. The
mass dependencies of the parameters $a^{c}_K $ and $b^{c}_K $ show a regime
change at a mass $\simeq 500 MeV/c^2$. According to the phenomenology of string
theory, these results could be explained by two processes occurring
simultaneously: string hadronization and string breaking. In the experiment we
can only measure the spectrum of the hadronized particles, since we cannot
access the spectrum of the strings themselves. The string breaking effect could
be a signal of string formations and the reason behind the observation of

typically the later algorithms have almost the same performance as the optimal

and to mimic the surroundings in short time. However, much research has not
been done on the entire mimicry mechanism in which the octopus recognizes the
surrounding landscape and changes the skin pattern. It seems that there is no
hypothetical model to explain the whole mimicry mechanism yet. In this study,
the mechanism of octopus skin pattern formation was assumed to be based on the
Turing model. Here, the pattern formation by the Turing model was realized by
the equivalent filter calculation model using the cellular automaton, instead
of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model
can create various patterns with two feature parameters. Furthermore, for the
eyes recognition part where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern
image, our study proposed a method that can be calculated back with small
amount of calculation using the characteristics of the cellular Turing pattern
model. These two calculations can be expressed in the same mathematical frame
based on the cellular automaton model using the convolution filter. As a
result, it can be created a model which is capable of extracting features from
patterns and reconstructing patterns in a short time, the model is considered
to be a basic model for considering the mimicry mechanism of octopus. Also, in
terms of application to machine learning, it is considered that it shows the
possibility of leading to a model with a small amount of learning calculation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01512v2
"Stochastic kinetic treatment of protein aggregation and the effects of
  macromolecular crowding",2021-02-02T15:51:34Z,"John Bridstrup, John S Schreck, Jesse L Jorgenson, Jian-Min Yuan","Investigation of protein self-assembly processes is important for the
understanding of the growth processes of functional proteins as well as
disease-causing amyloids. Inside cells, intrinsic molecular fluctuations are so
high that they cast doubt on the validity of the deterministic rate equation
approach. Furthermore, the protein environments inside cells are often crowded
with other macromolecules, with volume fractions of the crowders as high as
40%. We study protein self-aggregation at the cellular level using Gillespie's
stochastic algorithm and investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding
using models built on scaled-particle and transition-state theories. The
stochastic kinetic method can be formulated to provide information on the
dominating aggregation mechanisms in a method called reaction frequency (or
propensity) analysis. This method reveals that the change of scaling laws
related to the lag time can be directly related to the change in the
frequencies of reaction mechanisms. Further examination of the time evolution
of the fibril mass and length quantities unveils that maximal fluctuations
occur in the periods of rapid fibril growth and the fluctuations of both
quantities can be sensitive functions of rate constants. The presence of
crowders often amplifies the roles of primary and secondary nucleation and
causes shifting in the relative importance of elongation, shrinking,
fragmentation and coagulation of linear aggregates. Comparison of the results
of stochastic simulations with those of rate equations gives us information on
the convergence relation between them and how the roles of reaction mechanisms
change as the system volume is varied.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01569v1

  Science Text Analysis",2021-02-03T15:41:20Z,Sandra WankmÃ¼ller,"Transformer-based models for transfer learning have the potential to achieve
high prediction accuracies on text-based supervised learning tasks with
relatively few training data instances. These models are thus likely to benefit
social scientists that seek to have as accurate as possible text-based measures

scientists to leverage these potential benefits for their research, this paper
explains how these methods work, why they might be advantageous, and what their
limitations are. Additionally, three Transformer-based models for transfer
learning, BERT (Devlin et al. 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019), and the
Longformer (Beltagy et al. 2020), are compared to conventional machine learning
algorithms on three applications. Across all evaluated tasks, textual styles,

  agents",2021-02-04T02:58:32Z,"Yueying Zhu, Jian Jiang, Wei Li","The Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model allows one to characterize the continuous
change of agents' opinions with the bounded confidence threshold $\varepsilon$.
To consider the heterogeneity of agents in characteristics, we study the HK
model on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks by introducing a kind of smart
agent. Different from the averaging rule in opinion update of HK model, smart
agents will consider, in updating their opinions, the environmental influence
following the fact that an agent's behavior is often coupled with environmental
changes. The environment is characterized by a parameter that represents the
biased resource allocation between different cliques. We focus on the critical
behavior of the underlying system. A phase transition point separating a
complete consensus from the coexistence of different opinions is identified,
which occurs at a critical value $\varepsilon_c$ for the bounded confidence
threshold. We state analytically that $\varepsilon_c$ can take only one of two
possible values, depending on the behavior of the average degree $k_a$ of a
social graph, when agents are homogeneous in characteristics. Results also
suggest that the phase transition point weakly depends on the network structure
but is strongly correlated with the fraction of smart agents and the
environmental parameter. We finally establish the finite size scaling law that
stresses the role that the system size has in the underlying opinion dynamics.
Meanwhile, introducing smart agents does not change the functional dependence
between the time to reach a complete consensus and the system size. However, it
can drive a complete consensus to be reached faster, for homogeneous networks
that are far from the mean field limit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02385v1

  Requiring students to show evidence of understanding",2021-02-15T01:37:02Z,"Emily Marshman, Ryan Sayer, Charles Henderson, Edit Yerushalmi, Chandralekha Singh","Teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading in introductory
physics courses at large research universities. Their grading practices can
shape students' approaches to problem solving and learning. Physics education
research recommends grading practices that encourage students to provide
evidence of understanding via explication of the problem-solving process.
However, TAs may not necessarily grade in a manner that encourages students to
provide evidence of understanding in their solutions. Within the context of a
semester-long TA professional development course, we investigated whether
encouraging TAs to use a grading rubric that appropriately weights the
problem-solving process and having them reflect upon the benefits of using such
a rubric prompts TAs to require evidence of understanding in student solutions.
We examined how the TAs graded realistic student solutions to introductory
physics problems before they were provided a rubric, whether TAs used the
rubric as intended, whether they were consistent in grading similar solutions,
and how TAs' grading criteria changed after discussing the benefits of a
well-designed rubric. We find that many TAs typically applied the rubric
consistently when grading similar student solutions but did not require
students to provide evidence of understanding. TAs' written responses, class
discussions, and individual interviews suggest that the instructional
activities involving the grading rubrics in this study were not sufficient to
change their grading practices. Interviews and class discussions suggest that
helping TAs value a rubric that appropriately weights the problem-solving
process may be challenging partly due to the TAs past educational experiences

  Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images",2021-02-16T09:26:31Z,"Junzheng Wu, Biao Li, Yao Qin, Weiping Ni, Han Zhang, Yuli Sun","Change detection (CD) in remote sensing images has been an ever-expanding
area of research. To date, although many methods have been proposed using
various techniques, accurately identifying changes is still a great challenge,
especially in the high resolution or heterogeneous situations, due to the
difficulties in effectively modeling the features from ground objects with
different patterns. In this paper, a novel CD method based on the graph
convolutional network (GCN) and multiscale object-based technique is proposed
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous images. First, the object-wise high
level features are obtained through a pre-trained U-net and the multiscale
segmentations. Treating each parcel as a node, the graph representations can be
formed and then, fed into the proposed multiscale graph convolutional network
with each channel corresponding to one scale. The multiscale GCN propagates the
label information from a small number of labeled nodes to the other ones which
are unlabeled. Further, to comprehensively incorporate the information from the
output channels of multiscale GCN, a fusion strategy is designed using the
father-child relationships between scales. Extensive Experiments on optical,
SAR and heterogeneous optical/SAR data sets demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms some state-of the-art methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Besides, the Influences of some factors are also

credibility was influenced by changing the perceived race. We evaluate the
effect of showing a still image of a Black person versus a still image of a
White person using the same audio clip for each survey. We also test the effect
of showing either an original video or an altered video where the appearance of
the person in the original video is modified to appear more White. We measure
credibility as the percent of participant responses who believed the speaker
was telling the truth. We found that changing the race of a person in a static
image has negligible impact on credibility. However, the same manipulation of
race on a video increases credibility significantly (61\% to 73\% with p $<$

fundamentally different depending on whether the emission is from the
chromosphere or the corona. At some point between the two regions, there must
be a change between the two modelling regimes. Recent extensions to the coronal
modelling for carbon and oxygen lines in the solar transition region have shown
improvements in the emission of singly- and doubly-charged ions, along with
Li-like ions. However, discrepancies still remain, particularly for
singly-charged ions and intercombination lines. The aim of this work is to
explore additional atomic processes that could further alter the charge state
distribution and the level populations within ions, in order to resolve some of
the discrepancies. To this end, excitation and ionisation caused by both the
radiation field and by atom-ion collisions have been included, along with
recombination through charge transfer. The modelling is carried out using
conditions which would be present in the quiet Sun, which allows an assessment
of the part atomic processes play in changing coronal modelling, separately
from dynamic and transient events taking place in the plasma. The effect the
processes have on the fractional ion populations are presented, as well as the
change in level populations brought about by the new excitation mechanisms.
Contribution functions of selected lines from low charge states are also shown,

Person Re-identification based on Robust Features in Open-world,2021-02-22T06:49:28Z,"Yaguan Qian, Anlin Sun","Deep learning technology promotes the rapid development of person
re-identifica-tion (re-ID). However, some challenges are still existing in the
open-world. First, the existing re-ID research usually assumes only one factor
variable (view, clothing, pedestrian pose, pedestrian occlusion, image
resolution, RGB/IR modality) changing, ignoring the complexity of multi-factor
variables in the open-world. Second, the existing re-ID methods are over depend
on clothing color and other apparent features of pedestrian, which are easily
disguised or changed. In addition, the lack of benchmark datasets containing
multi-factor variables is also hindering the practically application of re-ID
in the open-world. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and high-efficiency
method to solve shortcomings of the existing re-ID research, such as unreliable
feature selection, low efficiency of feature extraction, single research
variable, etc. Our approach based on pose estimation model improved by group
convolution to obtain the continuous key points of pedestrian, and utilize
dynamic time warping (DTW) to measure the similarity of features between
different pedestrians. At the same time, to verify the effectiveness of our
method, we provide a miniature dataset which is closer to the real world and
includes pedestrian changing clothes and cross-modality factor variables

  Double Direct Spatial Isometries",2021-02-25T05:52:00Z,"Lubin Chang, Fangjun Qin, Jiangning Xu","The task of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) initial alignment is
to calculate the attitude transformation matrix from body frame to navigation
frame. In this paper, such attitude transformation matrix is divided into two
parts through introducing the initial inertially fixed navigation frame as
inertial frame. The attitude changes of the navigation frame corresponding to
the defined inertial frame can be exactly calculated with known velocity and
position provided by GNSS. The attitude from body frame to the defined inertial
frame is estimated based on the SINS mechanization in inertial frame. The
attitude, velocity and position in inertial frame are formulated together as
element of the group of double direct spatial isometries.It is proven that the
group state model in inertial frame satisfies a particular ""group affine""
property and the corresponding error model satisfies a ""log linear"" autonomous
differential equation on the Lie algebra. Based on such striking property, the
attitude from body frame to the defined inertial frame can be estimated based
on the linear error model with even extreme large misalignments. Two different
error state vectors are extracted based on right and left matrix
multiplications and the detailed linear state space models are derived based on
the right and left errors for SINS mechanization in inertial frame. With the
derived linear state space models, the explicit initial alignment procedures
have been presented. Extensive simulation and field tests indicate that the
initial alignment based on the left error model can perform quite well within a
wide range of initial attitude errors, although the used filter is still a type
of linear Kalman filter. This method is promising in practical products
abandoning the traditional coarse alignment stage.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12697v1

  Many studies investigated the evolution of design patterns and design
anti-patterns and their impact on software development. However, they
investigated design patterns or design anti-patterns in isolation and did not

Therefore, we report our study of bidirectional mutations between design

"Bayesian Functional Principal Components Analysis via Variational
  Message Passing",2021-04-01T17:42:15Z,"Tui H. Nolan, Jeff Goldsmith, David Ruppert","Functional principal components analysis is a popular tool for inference on
functional data. Standard approaches rely on an eigendecomposition of a
smoothed covariance surface in order to extract the orthonormal functions
representing the major modes of variation. This approach can be a
computationally intensive procedure, especially in the presence of large
datasets with irregular observations. In this article, we develop a Bayesian
approach, which aims to determine the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition directly
without the need to smooth and estimate a covariance surface. More
specifically, we develop a variational Bayesian algorithm via message passing
over a factor graph, which is more commonly referred to as variational message
passing. Message passing algorithms are a powerful tool for compartmentalizing
the algebra and coding required for inference in hierarchical statistical
models. Recently, there has been much focus on formulating variational
inference algorithms in the message passing framework because it removes the
need for rederiving approximate posterior density functions if there is a
change to the model. Instead, model changes are handled by changing specific
computational units, known as fragments, within the factor graph. We extend the
notion of variational message passing to functional principal components
analysis. Indeed, this is the first article to address a functional data model
via variational message passing. Our approach introduces two new fragments that
are necessary for Bayesian functional principal components analysis. We present
the computational details, a set of simulations for assessing accuracy and
speed and an application to United States temperature data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00645v1

cable) could perhaps be modeled as an approximately one dimensional system. In
this paper we rigorously explore the validity of such intuition from the
perspective of a localized probe coupling to a quantum field inside a cavity
(e.g., an atom or an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector in a fiber optic cable). To
do so, we introduce the notion of subfield decomposition in which a $D+1$
dimensional quantum field in an axially-symmetric cavity can be reduced to an
infinite collection of uncoupled, massive $1+1$ dimensional fields. We show
that the ability to approximate a higher-dimensional scenario by a $1+1$
dimensional model is equivalent to making a certain change of the probe's shape
in the higher-dimensional space. The approximation is justified whenever this
change of shape is ""small enough"". In this light, we identify the dynamically
relevant norm by which the magnitude of these changes in probe shape ought to
be judged. Finally, we explore this approximation in particular setups

distribution grids raises various reliability issues due to DER's uncertain and
complex behaviors. With a large-scale DER penetration in distribution grids,
traditional outage detection methods, which rely on customers report and smart
meters' last gasp signals, will have poor performance, because the renewable
generators and storages and the mesh structure in urban distribution grids can
continue supplying power after line outages. To address these challenges, we
propose a data-driven outage monitoring approach based on the stochastic time
series analysis with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we prove via power
flow analysis that the dependency of time-series voltage measurements exhibits
significant statistical changes after line outages. This makes the theory on
optimal change-point detection suitable to identify line outages. However,
existing change point detection methods require post-outage voltage
distribution, which is unknown in distribution systems. Therefore, we design a
maximum likelihood estimator to directly learn the distribution parameters from
voltage data. We prove that the estimated parameters-based detection also
achieves the optimal performance, making it extremely useful for fast
distribution grid outage identifications. Furthermore, since smart meters have
been widely installed in distribution grids and advanced infrastructure (e.g.,
PMU) has not widely been available, our approach only requires voltage
magnitude for quick outage identification. Simulation results show highly
accurate outage identification in eight distribution grids with 14

On Adaptive Fairness in Software Systems,2021-04-06T10:44:28Z,"Ali Farahani, Liliana Pasquale, Amel Bennaceur, Thomas Welsh, Bashar Nuseibeh","Software systems are increasingly making decisions on behalf of humans,
raising concerns about the fairness of such decisions. Such concerns are
usually attributed to flaws in algorithmic design or biased data, but we argue
that they are often the result of a lack of explicit specification of fairness
requirements. However, such requirements are challenging to elicit, a problem
exacerbated by increasingly dynamic environments in which software systems
operate, as well as stakeholders' changing needs. Therefore, capturing all
fairness requirements during the production of software is challenging, and is
insufficient for addressing software changes post deployment. In this paper, we
propose adaptive fairness as a means for maintaining the satisfaction of
changing fairness requirements. We demonstrate how to combine
requirements-driven and resource-driven adaptation in order to address
variabilities in both fairness requirements and their associated resources.
Using models for fairness requirements, resources, and their relations, we show
how the approach can be used to provide systems owners and end-users with
capabilities that reflect adaptive fairness behaviours at runtime. We
demonstrate our approach using an example drawn from shopping experiences of

numerical simulations are employed to describe the effects of welding position,
sulphur concentration (60-300 ppm) and travel speed (1.25-5 mm/s) on molten
metal flow dynamics in fully-penetrated melt-pools. A wavelet transform is
implemented to obtain time-resolved frequency spectra of the oscillation
signals, which overcomes the shortcomings of the Fourier transform in rendering
time resolution of the frequency spectra. Comparing the results of the present
numerical calculations with available analytical and experimental datasets, the
robustness of the proposed approach in predicting melt-pool oscillations is
demonstrated. The results reveal that changes in the surface morphology of the
pool resulting from a change in welding position alter the spatial distribution
of arc forces and power-density applied to the molten material, and in turn
affect flow patterns in the pool. Under similar welding conditions, changing
the sulphur concentration affects the Marangoni flow pattern, and increasing
the travel speed decreases the size of the pool and increases the offset
between top and bottom melt-pool surfaces, affecting the flow structures
(vortex formation) on the surface. Variations in the internal flow pattern

the overall shape of the ionization time distribution resembles the
XUV-envelope, its detail shows dependence on the emission direction of the
electron and the carrier-envelope phase of the pulse, which mainly results from
the low-energy interference structure. It is further found that the electron
from the counter-rotating term plays an important role in the interference. In
the case of the two-color pulse, both the time-energy distributions and the
ionization time distributions change with varying IR field. Our analysis
demonstrates that the IR field not only modifies the final electron kinetic

focus on the change in representations of observed data that arises when

"Breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence and dynamical generation
  of entanglement",2021-04-14T03:09:24Z,"Chushun Tian, Kun Yang","The {\it exchange} interaction arising from the particle indistinguishability
is of central importance to physics of many-particle quantum systems. Here we
study analytically the dynamical generation of quantum entanglement induced by
this interaction in an isolated system, namely, an ideal Fermi gas confined in
a chaotic cavity, which evolves unitarily from a non-Gaussian pure state. We
find that the breakdown of the quantum-classical correspondence of particle
motion, via dramatically changing the spatial structure of many-body
wavefunction, leads to profound changes of the entanglement structure.
Furthermore, for a class of initial states, such change leads to the approach
to thermal equilibrium everywhere in the cavity, with the well-known Ehrenfest
time in quantum chaos as the thermalization time. Specifically, the quantum
expectation values of various correlation functions at different spatial scales
are all determined by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. In addition, by using the
reduced density matrix (RDM) and the entanglement entropy (EE) as local probes,
we find that the gas inside a subsystem is at equilibrium with that outside,
and its thermal entropy is the EE, even though the whole system is in a pure
state. As a by-product of this work, we provide an analytical solution
supporting an important conjecture on thermalization, made and numerically
studied by Garrison and Grover in: Phys. Rev. X \textbf{8}, 021026 (2018), and
strengthen its statement.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06605v1
"Temporal Adaptation of BERT and Performance on Downstream Document
  Classification: Insights from Social Media",2021-04-16T13:48:53Z,"Paul RÃ¶ttger, Janet B. Pierrehumbert","Language use differs between domains and even within a domain, language use
changes over time. For pre-trained language models like BERT, domain adaptation
through continued pre-training has been shown to improve performance on
in-domain downstream tasks. In this article, we investigate whether temporal
adaptation can bring additional benefits. For this purpose, we introduce a
corpus of social media comments sampled over three years. It contains
unlabelled data for adaptation and evaluation on an upstream masked language
modelling task as well as labelled data for fine-tuning and evaluation on a
downstream document classification task. We find that temporality matters for
both tasks: temporal adaptation improves upstream and temporal fine-tuning
downstream task performance. Time-specific models generally perform better on
past than on future test sets, which matches evidence on the bursty usage of
topical words. However, adapting BERT to time and domain does not improve
performance on the downstream task over only adapting to domain. Token-level
analysis shows that temporal adaptation captures event-driven changes in
language use in the downstream task, but not those changes that are actually
relevant to task performance. Based on our findings, we discuss when temporal
adaptation may be more effective.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08116v2
Editing Factual Knowledge in Language Models,2021-04-16T15:24:42Z,"Nicola De Cao, Wilker Aziz, Ivan Titov","The factual knowledge acquired during pre-training and stored in the
parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g.,
question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be
incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a
method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or
unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or
fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not
require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning).
In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to
modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained
hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show
KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and
knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and
ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method,
changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a
consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this
can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated)
paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded
as a 'probe' revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate
factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated
on a small subset of components. Source code available at

  Graph Completion",2021-04-17T01:40:46Z,"Jiapeng Wu, Yishi Xu, Yingxue Zhang, Chen Ma, Mark Coates, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung","Reasoning in a temporal knowledge graph (TKG) is a critical task for
information retrieval and semantic search. It is particularly challenging when
the TKG is updated frequently. The model has to adapt to changes in the TKG for
efficient training and inference while preserving its performance on historical
knowledge. Recent work approaches TKG completion (TKGC) by augmenting the
encoder-decoder framework with a time-aware encoding function. However, naively
fine-tuning the model at every time step using these methods does not address
the problems of 1) catastrophic forgetting, 2) the model's inability to
identify the change of facts (e.g., the change of the political affiliation and
end of a marriage), and 3) the lack of training efficiency. To address these
challenges, we present the Time-aware Incremental Embedding (TIE) framework,
which combines TKG representation learning, experience replay, and temporal
regularization. We introduce a set of metrics that characterizes the
intransigence of the model and propose a constraint that associates the deleted
facts with negative labels. Experimental results on Wikidata12k and YAGO11k
datasets demonstrate that the proposed TIE framework reduces training time by
about ten times and improves on the proposed metrics compared to vanilla
full-batch training. It comes without a significant loss in performance for any
traditional measures. Extensive ablation studies reveal performance trade-offs

metallic glass rejuvenated by high pressure torsion performed at cryogenic

relaxations ({\alpha}-, {\beta}- and {\gamma}-transition) in glassy materials.
The results suggest that the structural footprint of the {\beta}-transition is
related to entropic relaxation with characteristics of a first-order
transition. Dynamic mechanical analysis data shows that in the range of the
{\beta}-transition, non-reversible structural rearrangements are preferentially
activated. The low-temperature {\gamma}-transition is mostly triggering

An Efficient Approach for Anomaly Detection in Traffic Videos,2021-04-20T04:43:18Z,"Keval Doshi, Yasin Yilmaz","Due to its relevance in intelligent transportation systems, anomaly detection
in traffic videos has recently received much interest. It remains a difficult
problem due to a variety of factors influencing the video quality of a
real-time traffic feed, such as temperature, perspective, lighting conditions,
and so on. Even though state-of-the-art methods perform well on the available
benchmark datasets, they need a large amount of external training data as well
as substantial computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient
approach for a video anomaly detection system which is capable of running at
the edge devices, e.g., on a roadside camera. The proposed approach comprises a
pre-processing module that detects changes in the scene and removes the
corrupted frames, a two-stage background modelling module and a two-stage
object detector. Finally, a backtracking anomaly detection algorithm computes a
similarity statistic and decides on the onset time of the anomaly. We also
propose a sequential change detection algorithm that can quickly adapt to a new
scene and detect changes in the similarity statistic. Experimental results on
the Track 4 test set of the 2021 AI City Challenge show the efficacy of the

we show that this reset energy can be reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude
by minimizing the pulse width. We utilize a high-speed measurement setup to
probe the energy consumption in PCM cells with varying pulse width (0.3 to 40

the switching power (P) remains unchanged for pulses wider than a short thermal
time constant of the PCM ($\tau$$_t$$_h$ < 1 ns in 50 nm diameter device),
resulting in a decrease of energy (E=P$\tau$) as the pulse width $\tau$ is
reduced in that range. In other words, thermal confinement during short pulses
is achieved by limiting the heat diffusion time. Our improved programming
scheme reduces reset energy density below 0.1 nJ/$\mu$m$^2$, over an order of

hydride ion migration is blocked by slow oxygen diffusion. In this study, we
investigate the hydride-ion migration mechanism using a kinetic Monte Carlo

The difficulties in applying the method to hydride and oxygen ion migration

predict the temperature-dependent ionic-migration behavior. We found that our
simulation results with respect to the activation barrier for hydride ion

hydride ion migration is affected by slow oxygen diffusion and that oxygen
diffusion is accelerated by changes in the ionic migration barriers. The

First, correlations between nodal voltages are derived from nodal voltage

weakly-coupled voltage control zones based on nodal voltage correlations. IBR
are used in the first stage to regulate voltage changes continuously and VR are
used in the second stage to regulate large voltage deviations. An online VR
voltage setpoint tuning strategy is developed to reduce excessive tap changes
and avoid large voltage fluctuations without retrofitting existing VR
controllers. In addition, the proposed algorithm uses real-time voltage
measurements only from the critical nodes (typically less than 4% of total
nodes) to reduce the sensing and communication needs. Actual distribution
feeder topologies and load and PV time-series data are used to verify the
performance of the algorithm. Because the method is a rule-based approach, it
runs extremely fast, requires fewer measurements, and requires no retrofit to

larger than that of the near-UV flux. However, the correlated variability seen
between different BAL components cannot be explained solely by photoionization

changes in operational and environmental conditions. Conventional methods for
anomalous sound detection face practical challenges because the distribution of
features changes between the training and operational phases (called domain
shift) due to various real-world factors. To check the robustness against
domain shifts, we need a dataset that actually includes domain shifts, but such
a dataset does not exist so far. The new dataset we created consists of the
normal and abnormal operating sounds of five different types of industrial
machines under two different operational/environmental conditions (source
domain and target domain) independent of normal/abnormal, with domain shifts
occurring between the two domains. Experimental results showed significant
performance differences between the source and target domains, indicating that
the dataset contains the domain shifts. These findings demonstrate that the

The dynamics of spatially confined oscillations,2021-05-05T18:00:01Z,"Till Stadtler, Pavel Kroupa, Manfred Schmid","The possible relation of the wave nature of particles to gravitation as an
emergent phenomenon is addressed. Hypothetical particles are considered as
spatially confined oscillations (SCOs) and are constructed through the
superposition of plane waves. The effect of a continuously changing refractive
index (speed of propagation field) on SCOs is calculated and the continuous
Ibn-Sahl--Snell law of refraction is derived. Refracted plane wave constituents
of SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium cause the oscillation as a whole to
accelerate as an entity. This acceleration is described by a geodesic equation,
in much the same way as in general relativity. The proper time of an SCO can be
defined via its oscillation frequency. The proper time and its change along the
trajectory are equivalent to a particle in general relativity as described by
the 0th component of its geodesic equation. An SCO in an inhomogeneous
refractive index field exhibits general relativistic properties based on basic
wave mechanics. Properties derived from direct calculations are length
contraction, gravitational red- and blueshift and Thomas precession. The
presented theory is an approximation for oscillations which are small compared
to changes in the refractive index field. SCOs in an inhomogeneous medium may
thus yield a naturally emerging particle-field interaction with general
relativistic properties and may allow a useful vantage point on the nature of
gravitation using classical-wave experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03230v1
"Systematic search for long-term transit duration changes in Kepler
  transiting planets",2021-05-10T12:55:31Z,"Sahar Shahaf, Tsevi Mazeh, Shay Zucker, Daniel Fabrycky","Holczer, Mazeh, and collaborators (HM+16) used the Kepler four-year
observations to derive a transit-timing catalog, identifying 260 Kepler objects
of interest (KOI) with significant transit timing variations (TTV). For KOIs
with high enough SNRs, HM+16 also derived the duration and depth of their
transits. In the present work, we use the duration measurements of HM+16 to
systematically study the duration changes of 561 KOIs and identify 15 KOIs with
a significant long-term linear change of transit durations and another 16 KOIs
with an intermediate significance. We show that the observed linear trend is
probably caused by a precession of the orbital plane of the transiting planet,
induced in most cases by another planet. The leading term of the precession
rate depends on the mass and relative inclination of the perturber, and the
period ratio between the two orbits, but not on the mass and period of the
transiting planet itself. Interestingly, our findings indicate that, as a
sample, the detected time derivatives of the durations get larger as a function
of the planetary orbital period, probably because short-period planetary
systems display small relative inclinations. The results might indicate that
short-period planets reside in relatively flattened planetary systems,
suggesting these systems experienced stronger dissipation either when formed or
when migrated to short orbits. This should be used as a possible clue for the
formation of such systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04318v1

  with Power Reserves and Fast Frequency Response Capabilities",2021-05-11T19:53:51Z,"Victor Paduani, Hui Yu, Bei Xu, Ning Lu","This paper presents a fast power-setpoint tracking algorithm to enable
utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems to provide high quality grid services

maximum power-point estimation (MPPE) with flexible power-point tracking (FPPT)
control to improve the performance of both algorithms, achieving fast and
accurate PV power-setpoint tracking even under rapid solar irradiance changes.
The MPPE is developed using a real-time, nonlinear curve-fitting approach based
on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. A modified adaptive FPPT based on the
Perturb and Observe technique is developed for the power-setpoint tracking. By
using MPPE to decouple the impact of irradiance changes on the measured PV
output power, we develop a fast convergence technique for tracking
power-reference changes within three FPPT iterations. Furthermore, to limit the
maximum output power ripple, a new design is introduced for the steady-state
voltage step size of the adaptive FPPT. The proposed algorithm is implemented
on a testbed consisting of a 500 kVA three-phase, single-stage, utility-scale

peculiarities. An average centenary warming effect deltaT = (1.08+/-0.29) C is
observed in Poland and in Tbilisi for 1881-2016. A warming effect is larger in
winter season (deltaT = ~1.15 C) than in other seasons (average warming effect
for these seasons deltaT = ~0.95 C). We show that a centenary warming is mainly
related to the change of solar activity (estimated by sunspot numbers (SSN) and
total solar irradiance (TSI)); particularly, a time interval about ~70 years
(1890-1960), when a correlation coefficients between 11 years smoothed SSN and
T, and TSI and T are high, r = 0.66+/-0.07 and r = 0.73+/-0.07 for Poland and r
= 0.82+/-0.05 and r = 0.90+/-0.05 for Tbilisi, respectively; in this period
solar activity contributes decisively in the global warming. We show that a
global warming effect equals zero based on the temperature T data in Poland for
period 1781-1880, when human activities were relatively less than in 1881-2016.
We recognize a few feeble ~20+/-3 years disturbances in the temperature changes

healthcare with models reaching, or even surpassing, expert accuracy levels.
However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of

sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of
these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations
are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the
classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about
trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models
capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious
correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that
the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary
significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how
the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency
which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We
find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a
low consistency: $\approx$ 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are

The existing works fall into three categories: assessing facial appearance

However, (1) appearance changes are easily affected by subjective factors which
impedes objective pain recognition. Besides, the appearance-based approaches
ignore long-range spatial-temporal dependencies that are important for modeling

sensors on human body, which is inconvenient and uncomfortable. In this paper,
we present a novel multi-task learning framework which encodes both appearance

The framework is able to capture both local and long-range dependencies via the
proposed attention mechanism for the learned appearance representations, which
are further enriched by temporally attended physiological cues (remote

choices in tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography.
Such detectors offer high resolution and high efficiency at reasonable cost for
large sizes, however, one of the drawbacks is that the gaseous detection medium
must be prevented from contamination by outside air or internal outgassing.
Standard systems work with a constant gas flow, leading to regular maintenance
in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an issue for remote field
applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to reduce
gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas
density change from daily temperature cycling limits the input flow. Such

imposed as terms in a loss function or used to formulate a neural ansatz. In
the present case study, we calculate the induced field inside and outside a
dielectric cube placed in a uniform electric field, wherein the dielectric
mismatch at edges and corners of the cube makes accurate calculations
numerically challenging. The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz
incorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries

that both Laplace's equation and boundary conditions are satisfied everywhere

"Individual risk-aversion responses tune epidemics to critical
  transmissibility ($R=1$)",2021-05-21T21:05:38Z,"Susanna Manrubia, DamiÃ¡n H. Zanette","Changes in human behavior are increasingly recognized as a major determinant
of epidemic dynamics. Although collective activity can be modified through
imposed measures to control epidemic progression, spontaneous changes can also
arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk
of contagion. Here we introduce a stochastic epidemic model that implements
population responses driven by individual- and time-dependent risk-taking
propensity. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of
multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude without the need to consider
external modulation of parameters. Successive waves tune the effective
reproduction number to its critical value $R=1$. This process is a consequence
of the interplay of the fractions of susceptible and infected population and
the average risk-taking propensity, as shown by a mean-field approach. The
proposed mechanism also shows how, under the threat of contagion, the
distribution of individual risk propensities evolves towards a well-defined
profile. Successive waves trigger selective sweeps of risk-taking propensity at
a pace determined by individual risk reaction rates. This kind of collective,
self-generated pressure, may therefore shape risk-aversion profiles associated
to epidemics in human groups. The final state is self-organized and generic,
independent of the parameter values. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in
human behavior can, by themselves, explain major qualitative and quantitative
features of the epidemic process, as the emergence of multiple waves and the
tendency to remain around $R=1$ observed worldwide after the first few waves of
COVID-19.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10572v1

Measuring Financial Advice: aligning client elicited and revealed risk,2021-05-25T12:55:03Z,"John R. J. Thompson, Longlong Feng, R. Mark Reesor, Chuck Grace, Adam Metzler","Financial advisors use questionnaires and discussions with clients to
determine a suitable portfolio of assets that will allow clients to reach their

to choose an investment portfolio risk that suits their stated risk tolerance.
This paper compares client Know Your Client (KYC) profile risk allocations to
their investment portfolio risk selections using a value-at-risk discrepancy
methodology. Value-at-risk is used to measure elicited and revealed risk to
show whether clients are over-risked or under-risked, changes in KYC risk lead
to changes in portfolio configuration, and cash flow affects a client's

re-optimizing solutions dynamically rather than from scratch, especially if

what extent dynamic algorithms can be used to speed up fundamental tasks in

  Robustness of the Fair Proportion Index",2021-07-01T21:29:30Z,"Mareike Fischer, Andrew Francis, Kristina Wicke","Planning for the protection of species often involves difficult choices about
which species to prioritize, given constrained resources. One way of
prioritizing species is to consider their ""evolutionary distinctiveness"", i.e.
their relative evolutionary isolation on a phylogenetic tree. Several
evolutionary isolation metrics or phylogenetic diversity indices have been
introduced in the literature, among them the so-called Fair Proportion index
(also known as the ""evolutionary distinctiveness"" score). This index apportions
the total diversity of a tree among all leaves, thereby providing a simple
prioritization criterion for conservation.
  Here, we focus on the prioritization order obtained from the Fair Proportion
index and analyze the effects of species extinction on this ranking. More
precisely, we analyze the extent to which the ranking order may change when
some species go extinct and the Fair Proportion index is re-computed for the
remaining taxa. We show that for each phylogenetic tree, there are edge lengths
such that the extinction of one leaf per cherry completely reverses the
ranking. Moreover, we show that even if only the lowest ranked species goes
extinct, the ranking order may drastically change. We end by analyzing the
effects of these two extinction scenarios (extinction of the lowest ranked
species and extinction of one leaf per cherry) for a collection of empirical
and simulated trees. In both cases, we can observe significant changes in the
prioritization orders, highlighting the empirical relevance of our theoretical
findings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00748v1

contact with the ground to support the long body, which impedes
maneuverability. To improve the locomotion maneuverability of such robots, the
present study focuses on dynamic instability, which induces rapid and large
movement changes, and uses a 12-legged robot with a flexible body axis. Our
previous work found that the straight walk of the robot becomes unstable
through Hopf bifurcation when the body axis flexibility is changed, which
induces body undulations. Furthermore, we developed a simple controller based
on the Hopf bifurcation and showed that the instability facilitates the turning
of the robot. In this study, we newly found that the straight walk becomes
unstable through pitchfork bifurcation when the body-axis flexibility is
changed in a way different from that in our previous work. In addition, the
pitchfork bifurcation induces a transition into a curved walk, whose curvature
can be controlled by the body-axis flexibility. We developed a simple
controller based on the pitchfork-bifurcation characteristics and demonstrated
that the robot can perform a turning maneuver superior to that with the

Detecting Concept Drift With Neural Network Model Uncertainty,2021-07-05T08:56:36Z,"Lucas Baier, Tim SchlÃ¶r, Jakob SchÃ¶ffer, Niklas KÃ¼hl","Deployed machine learning models are confronted with the problem of changing
data over time, a phenomenon also called concept drift. While existing
approaches of concept drift detection already show convincing results, they

Especially in many real-world application scenarios-like the ones covered in
this work-true labels are scarce, and their acquisition is expensive.
Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm for drift detection, Uncertainty Drift
Detection (UDD), which is able to detect drifts without access to true labels.
Our approach is based on the uncertainty estimates provided by a deep neural
network in combination with Monte Carlo Dropout. Structural changes over time
are detected by applying the ADWIN technique on the uncertainty estimates, and
detected drifts trigger a retraining of the prediction model. In contrast to
input data-based drift detection, our approach considers the effects of the
current input data on the properties of the prediction model rather than
detecting change on the input data only (which can lead to unnecessary
retrainings). We show that UDD outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies on

global decisions, instead, involve whole traffic flows. Such decisions are made
at different time scales by different entities, which are integrated within an

Santander-Syro","In matter, any spontaneous symmetry breaking induces a phase transition
characterized by an order parameter, such as the magnetization vector in
ferromagnets, or a macroscopic many-electron wave-function in superconductors.
Phase transitions with unknown order parameter are rare but extremely
appealing, as they may lead to novel physics. An emblematic, and still
unsolved, example is the transition of the heavy fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$
(URS) into the so-called hidden-order (HO) phase when the temperature drops
below $T_0 = 17.5$K. Here we show that the interaction between the heavy
fermion and the conduction band states near the Fermi level has a key role in
the emergence of the HO phase. Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy,
we find that while the Fermi surfaces of the HO and of a neighboring
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of well-defined order parameter have the same
topography, they differ in the size of some, but not all, of their electron
pockets. Such a non-rigid change of the electronic structure indicates that a
change in the interaction strength between states near the Fermi level is a
crucial ingredient for the HO-to-AFM phase transition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03872v1

universities move to restrict campus activities, reduce indoor gatherings and
move instruction online. These changes required that students adapt and alter
their daily routines accordingly. To investigate patterns associated with these
behavioral changes, we collected smartphone sensing data using the Beiwe
platform from two groups of undergraduate students at a major North American
university, one from January to March of 2020 (74 participants), the other from
May to August (52 participants), to observe the differences in students' daily

focus on the mobility patterns evidenced by GPS signal tracking from the

including principal component analysis, circadian rhythm analysis, and
predictive modeling of perceived sadness levels using mobility-based digital

the mid-COVID group generally (1) registered a greater amount of midday
movement than movement in the morning (8-10am) and in the evening (7-9pm), as

FedAdapt: Adaptive Offloading for IoT Devices in Federated Learning,2021-07-09T07:29:55Z,"Di Wu, Rehmat Ullah, Paul Harvey, Peter Kilpatrick, Ivor Spence, Blesson Varghese","Applying Federated Learning (FL) on Internet-of-Things devices is
necessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of
data privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to
make FL efficient: (i) execution on devices with limited computational
capabilities, (ii) accounting for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity
of devices, and (iii) adaptation to the changing network bandwidths. This paper
presents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the
aforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in
computationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep
neural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement
learning based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers
of the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to
tackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network
bandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed and it
is demonstrated that by offloading a DNN from the device to the server FedAdapt
reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half compared to
classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall training
time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network bandwidth,
FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40% when compared
to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04271v5
Cosmic Web-Halo Connection Between Twin Universes,2021-07-12T19:00:05Z,"Hou-Zun Chen, Xi Kang, Peng Wang, Noam I. Libeskind, Yu Luo","Both simulation and observational data have shown that the spin and shape of
dark matter halos are correlated with their nearby large-scale environment. As
structure formation on different scales is strongly coupled, it is trick to
disentangle the formation of halo with the large-scale environment, making it
difficult to infer which is the driving force for the correlation between halo
spin/shape with the large-scale structure. In this paper, we use N-body
simulation to produce twin Universes that share the same initial conditions on
small scales but different on large scales. This is achieved by changing the
random seeds for the phase of those k modes smaller than a given scale in the
initial conditions. In this way, we are able to disentangle the formation of
halo and large-scale structure, making it possible to investigate how halo spin
and shape correspond to the change of environment on large scales. We identify
matching halo pairs in the twin simulations as those sharing the maximum number
of identical particles within each other. Using these matched halo pairs, we
study the cross match of halo spin and their correlation with the large-scale
structure. It is found that when the large-scale environment changes
(eigenvector) between the twin simulations, the halo spin has to rotate
accordingly, although not significantly, to maintain the universal correlation
seen in each simulation. Our results suggest that the large-scale structure is
the main factor to drive the correlation between halo properties and their
environment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05689v1

  topological crystalline insulator SnTe",2021-07-14T09:00:27Z,"Ayanesh Maiti, Ram Prakash Pandeya, Bahadur Singh, Kartik K Iyer, A Thamizhavel, Kalobaran Maiti","Discovery of topologically protected surface states, believed to be immune to
weak disorder and thermal effects, opened up a new avenue to reveal exotic
fundamental science and advanced technology. While time-reversal symmetry plays
the key role in most such materials, the bulk crystalline symmetries such as
mirror symmetry preserve the topological properties of topological crystalline
insulators (TCIs). It is apparent that any structural change may alter the
topological properties of TCIs. To investigate this relatively unexplored
landscape, we study the temperature evolution of the Dirac fermion states in an
archetypical mirror-symmetry protected TCI, SnTe employing high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory
studies. Experimental results reveal a perplexing scenario; the bulk bands
observed at 22 K move nearer to the Fermi level at 60 K and again shift back to
higher binding energies at 120 K. The slope of the surface Dirac bands at 22 K
becomes smaller at 60 K and changes back to a larger value at 120 K. Our
results from the first-principles calculations suggest that these anomalies can
be attributed to the evolution of the hybridization physics with complex
structural changes induced by temperature. In addition, we discover drastically
reduced intensity of the Dirac states at the Fermi level at high temperatures
may be due to complex evolution of anharmonicity, strain, etc. These results
address robustness of the topologically protected surface states due to thermal
effects and emphasize importance of covalency and anharmonicity in the
topological properties of such emerging quantum materials.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06562v1
"Polarization and coherence in mean field games driven by private and
  social utility",2021-07-13T15:13:09Z,"Dai Pra Paolo, Sartori Elena, Tolotti Marco","We study a mean field game in continuous time over a finite horizon, T, where
the state of each agent is binary and where players base their strategic
decisions on two, possibly competing, factors: the willingness to align with
the majority (conformism) and the aspiration of sticking with the own type
(stubbornness). We also consider a quadratic cost related to the rate at which
a change in the state happens: changing opinion may be a costly operation.
Depending on the parameters of the model, the game may have more than one Nash
equilibrium, even though the corresponding N-player game does not. Moreover, it
exhibits a very rich phase diagram, where polarized/unpolarized,
coherent/incoherent equilibria may coexist, except for T small, where the
equilibrium is always unique. We fully describe such phase diagram in closed
form and provide a detailed numerical analysis of the N-player counterpart of
the mean field game. In this finite dimensional setting, the equilibrium
selected by the population of players is always coherent (favoring the
subpopulation whose type is aligned with the initial condition), but it does
not necessarily minimize the cost functional. Rather, it seems that, among the
coherent ones, the equilibrium prevailing is the one that most benefits the
underdog subpopulation forced to change opinion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06667v1
"A Multi-stage Stochastic Programming Model for Adaptive Biomass
  Processing Operation under Uncertainty",2021-07-16T18:51:31Z,"Berkay Gulcan, Yongjia Song, Sandra D. Eksioglu","Variations of physical and chemical characteristics of biomass reduce
equipment utilization and increase operational costs of biomass processing.
Biomass processing facilities use sensors to monitor the changes in biomass
characteristics. Integrating sensory data into the operational decisions in
biomass processing will increase its flexibility to the changing biomass
conditions. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage stochastic programming
model that minimizes the expected operational costs by identifying the initial
inventory level and creating an operational decision policy for equipment speed
settings. These policies take the sensory information data and the current
biomass inventory level as inputs to dynamically adjust inventory levels and
equipment settings according to the changes in the biomass' characteristics. We
ensure that a prescribed target reactor utilization is consistently achieved by
penalizing the violation of the target reactor feeding rate. A case study is
developed using real-world data collected at Idaho National Laboratory's
biomass processing facility. We show the value of multi-stage stochastic
programming from an extensive computational experiment. Our sensitivity
analysis indicates that updating the infeed rate of the system, the processing
speed of equipment, and bale sequencing based on the moisture level of biomass
improves the processing rate of the reactor and reduces operating costs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08078v1
The bluest changing-look QSO SDSS J224113-012108,2021-07-20T01:14:38Z,Zhang XueGuang,"In this manuscript, we report a new changing-look QSO (CLQSO) SDSS J2241 at

ratio of broad H$\alpha$ to broad H$\beta$ has been changed from 7\ in 2011 to
2.7\ in 2017, leading SDSS J2241 with spectral index
$\alpha_\lambda\sim-5.21\pm0.02$ ($\lambda< 4000$\AA) in 2017 to be so-far the
bluest CLQSO. Based on the SDSS spectrum in 2011, the host galaxy contributions
with stellar velocity dispersion $\sim86{\rm km/s}$ can be well determined,
leading to the M-sigma relation expected central BH mass $\sim3\times10^6{\rm
M_\odot}$. However, through properties of the broad H$\alpha$, the virial BH
mass is $\sim10^8{\rm M_\odot}$, about two magnitudes larger than the mass
through the M-sigma relation. The different BH masses through different methods
indicate SDSS J2241 is one unique CLQSO. Meanwhile, the long-term photometric
light curve shows interesting variability properties, not expected by DRW
process commonly applied in AGN but probably connected to a central TDE.
Furthermore, based on continuum emission properties in 2017 with no dust
obscurations, only considering the moving dust clouds cannot be preferred to
explain the CLQSO SDSS J2241, because the expected intrinsic reddening
corrected continuum emissions were unreasonably higher than the unobscured
continuum emissions in 2017.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09214v1

A Real Time Monitoring Approach for Bivariate Event Data,2021-07-26T05:51:51Z,"Inez Maria Zwetsloot, Tahir Mahmood, Funmilola Mary Taiwo, Zezhong Wang","Early detection of changes in the frequency of events is an important task,
in, for example, disease surveillance, monitoring of high-quality processes,
reliability monitoring and public health. In this article, we focus on
detecting changes in multivariate event data, by monitoring the
time-between-events (TBE). Existing multivariate TBE charts are limited in the
sense that, they only signal after an event occurred for each of the individual
processes. This results in delays (i.e., long time to signal), especially if it
is of interest to detect a change in one or a few of the processes. We propose
a bivariate TBE (BTBE) chart which is able to signal in real time. We derive
analytical expressions for the control limits and average time-to-signal
performance, conduct a performance evaluation and compare our chart to an
existing method. The findings showed that our method is a realistic approach to
monitor bivariate time-between-event data, and has better detection ability
than existing methods. A large benefit of our method is that it signals in
real-time and that due to the analytical expressions no simulation is needed.
The proposed method is implemented on a real-life dataset related to AIDS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11971v1

magnetic transitions of the orthorhombic Haldane-spin chain compound Tb2BaNiO5
an exotic multiferroic material. This parent compound is known to undergo
N\'eel ordering at TN1= 63 K and another magnetic transition at TN2= 25K at
which ferroelectricity sets in, however, without any change in the magnetic
symmetry, but with only a sharp change in the canting angle of Tb 4f and Ni 3d
magnetic moments. There is a subtle difference in the antiferromagnetic state
above and below TN2, which is supported by the fact that there is a
metamagnetic transition below TN2only (for 5 K, at about 60 kOe). We report
here that, with the application of external pressure, there is an upward shift
of TN1, while TN2 shifts towards lower temperatures. It is interesting that the
two magnetic transitions in the same compound behave differently under pressure
and the opposite behavior at TN2 is attributed to local distortion leading to
ferroelectricity. The results are augmented by temperature dependent x-ray
diffraction and positive chemical pressure studies. The chemical pressure
caused by the isoelectronic doping at Ba site by Sr reduces both the transition
temperatures. Clearly, the external pressure favors antiferromagnetic coupling
(that is, leading to TN1 enhancement), whereas the chemical pressure reduces
TN1, suggesting important role of the changes in local hybridization induced by
doping on magnetism in this material.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12729v1
The Robustness of Graph k-shell Structure under Adversarial Attacks,2021-07-29T13:51:17Z,"B. Zhou, Y. Q. Lv, Y. C. Mao, J. H. Wang, S. Q. Yu, Q. Xuan","The k-shell decomposition plays an important role in unveiling the structural
properties of a network, i.e., it is widely adopted to find the densest part of
a network across a broad range of scientific fields, including Internet,
biological networks, social networks, etc. However, there arises concern about
the robustness of the k-shell structure when networks suffer from adversarial
attacks. Here, we introduce and formalize the problem of the k-shell attack and
develop an efficient strategy to attack the k-shell structure by rewiring a
small number of links. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to
study the robustness of graph k-shell structure under adversarial attacks. In
particular, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA) based k-shell attack method
and testify it on four real-world social networks. The extensive experiments
validate that the k-shell structure of a network is robust under random
perturbation, but it is quite vulnerable under adversarial attack, e.g., in
Dolphin and Throne networks, more than 40% nodes change their k-shell values
when only 10% links are changed based on our SA-based k-shell attack. Such
results suggest that a single structural feature could also be significantly
disturbed when only a small fraction of links are changed purposefully in a
network. Therefore, it could be an interesting topic to improve the robustness
of various network properties against adversarial attack in the future.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13962v1
Tiny Machine Learning for Concept Drift,2021-07-30T17:02:04Z,"Simone Disabato, Manuel Roveri","Tiny Machine Learning (TML) is a new research area whose goal is to design
machine and deep learning techniques able to operate in Embedded Systems and
IoT units, hence satisfying the severe technological constraints on memory,
computation, and energy characterizing these pervasive devices. Interestingly,
the related literature mainly focused on reducing the computational and memory
demand of the inference phase of machine and deep learning models. At the same
time, the training is typically assumed to be carried out in Cloud or edge
computing systems (due to the larger memory and computational requirements).
This assumption results in TML solutions that might become obsolete when the
process generating the data is affected by concept drift (e.g., due to
periodicity or seasonality effect, faults or malfunctioning affecting sensors
or actuators, or changes in the users' behavior), a common situation in
real-world application scenarios. For the first time in the literature, this
paper introduces a Tiny Machine Learning for Concept Drift (TML-CD) solution
based on deep learning feature extractors and a k-nearest neighbors classifier
integrating a hybrid adaptation module able to deal with concept drift
affecting the data-generating process. This adaptation module continuously
updates (in a passive way) the knowledge base of TML-CD and, at the same time,
employs a Change Detection Test to inspect for changes (in an active way) to
quickly adapt to concept drift by removing the obsolete knowledge. Experimental
results on both image and audio benchmarks show the effectiveness of the
proposed solution, whilst the porting of TML-CD on three off-the-shelf
micro-controller units shows the feasibility of what is proposed in real-world
pervasive systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14759v1
"A mechanistic model for the asymmetric torque-speed relationships of a
  bacterial flagellar motor",2021-09-04T08:16:18Z,"Biswajit Das, Hao Ge","A tiny bacterial flagellar motor rotates in both counter-clockwise (CCW) and
clockwise (CW) rotational directions. The most important measurable
characteristic of the flagellar motor is its torque versus angular speed
relationship in CCW or CW modes, which is found to be non-symmetrical with each
other, and still, such a phenomenon is not clearly understood.Here, we explain
this asymmetry through a mechanistic model based on the detailed torque
analysis for the rotation of the motor and the revolutionary as well as
spinning motion of the filament and bead. We find out that the asymmetry
results from the conformational changing of the hook due to rotational
switching, rather than any non-symmetric changes in the potential of mean force
generated by the stator-rotor interactions. In CCW mode, when the hook remains
bend and flexible, the revolution motion predominates and the restoring torque
in this motion, originated due to drag, governs the shape of the torque-speed
curve. However, in CW mode, spinning motion dominates as the hook becomes
straight and rigid, and the linear torque-speed relation arises due to the
restoring torque for the drag corresponding to this motion. Our study indicates
the significant role of the hook's conformational change upon the biological
functions of the motor and paves the way for further experimental exploration
on the structural origin of such asymmetry.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01813v1
"The Emotional Roller Coaster of Responding to Requirements Changes in

practitioners respond to requirements changes(RCs) with different emotions, and
that their emotions vary at stages of the RC handling life cycle, such as
receiving, developing, and delivering RCs. Objective: We wanted to study more
comprehensively how practitioners emotionally respond to RCs. Method: We
conducted a world-wide survey with the participation of 201 software
practitioners. In our survey, we used the Job-related Affective Well-being
Scale (JAWS) and open-ended questions to capture participants emotions when
handling RCs in their work and query about the different circumstances when
they feel these emotions. We used a combined approach of statistical analysis,
JAWS, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) for Data Analysis to analyse
our survey data. Findings: We identified (1) emotional responses to RCs, i.e.,
the most common emotions felt by practitioners when handling RCs; (2) different
stimuli -- such as the RC, the practitioner, team, manager, customer -- that
trigger these emotions through their own different characteristics; (3)emotion
dynamics, i.e., the changes in emotions during the project and RC handling life
cycles; (4) distinct events where particular emotions are triggered:project
milestones, and RC stages; (5) and time related matters that regulate the
emotion dynamics. Conclusion: Practitioners are not pleased with receiving RCs
all the time. Last minute RCs introduced closer to a deadline especially
violate emotional well-being of practitioners. We present some practical
recommendations for practitioners to follow, including a dual-purpose
emotion-centric decision guide to help decide when to introduce or accept an

Maxwellian distribution of electrons and protons and dust particles charged by
inelastic collisions and by photoionization, we analyse the dispersion relation
considering the case where waves and radiation propagate exactly parallel to
the ambient magnetic field. The investigation emphasizes the changes that the
photoionization process brings to the propagation and damping of the waves in a
stellar wind environment, since Alfv\'en waves are believed to play a
significant role in the heating and acceleration processes that take place in
the wind. The results show that, in the presence of dust with negative
equilibrium electrical charge, the Alfv\'en mode decouples into the whistler
and ion cyclotron modes for all values of wavenumber, but when dust particles
acquire neutral or positive values of electrical charge, these modes may couple
for certain values of wavenumber. It is also seen that the whistler and ion
cyclotron modes present null group velocity in a interval of small wavenumber,
and that the maximum value of wavenumber for which the waves are
non-propagating is reduced in the presence of the photoionization process. For
very small values of wavenumber, the damping rates of the modes could change
significantly from very small to very high values if the sign of the dust
electrical charge is changed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06320v1
Can Edge Probing Tasks Reveal Linguistic Knowledge in QA Models?,2021-09-15T06:16:12Z,"Sagnik Ray Choudhury, Nikita Bhutani, Isabelle Augenstein","There have been many efforts to try to understand what grammatical knowledge
(e.g., ability to understand the part of speech of a token) is encoded in large
pre-trained language models (LM). This is done through `Edge Probing' (EP)
tests: supervised classification tasks to predict the grammatical properties of
a span (whether it has a particular part of speech) using only the token
representations coming from the LM encoder. However, most NLP applications
fine-tune these LM encoders for specific tasks. Here, we ask: if an LM is
fine-tuned, does the encoding of linguistic information in it change, as
measured by EP tests? Specifically, we focus on the task of Question Answering
(QA) and conduct experiments on multiple datasets. We find that EP test results
do not change significantly when the fine-tuned model performs well or in
adversarial situations where the model is forced to learn wrong correlations.
From a similar finding, some recent papers conclude that fine-tuning does not
change linguistic knowledge in encoders but they do not provide an explanation.
We find that EP models themselves are susceptible to exploiting spurious
correlations in the EP datasets. When this dataset bias is corrected, we do see
an improvement in the EP test results as expected.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07102v3

evolution is dominated by episodes of spin-down with $n > 10$, punctuated by
step changes in the spin-down rate at the time of a large glitch. The step
changes are such that, averaged over the glitches, the long-term $n$ is small.

according to various road accident records. Thus, reliably predicting such
manoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of
automated driving systems. The majority of previous studies rely on detecting a
manoeuvre that has been already started, rather than predicting the manoeuvre
in advance. Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key
timings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more
useful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these
shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously
estimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In
both tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a
shared feature extractor from a bird's eye view representation of the driving

allowing these resources to be allocated for other navigation tasks. In this
work, our goal is to provide an algorithm of extreme compactness and efficiency
while achieving state-of-the-art robustness to appearance changes and small
point-of-view variations. Our first contribution is DrosoNet, an exceptionally
compact model inspired by the odor processing abilities of the fruit fly,
Drosophyla melanogaster. Our second and main contribution is a voting mechanism
that leverages multiple small and efficient classifiers to achieve more robust
and consistent VPR compared to a single one. We use DrosoNet as the baseline
classifier for the voting mechanism and evaluate our models on five benchmark
datasets, assessing moderate to extreme appearance changes and small to
moderate viewpoint variations. We then compare the proposed algorithms to
state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of precision-recall AUC results and
computational efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10986v1
"Intermediate spin state and the B1-B2 transition in ferropericlase at
  tera-Pascal pressures",2021-09-22T19:55:28Z,"Tianqi Wan, Yang Sun, Renata M. Wentzcovitch","Ferropericlase (fp), (Mg$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)O, the second most abundant mineral in
the Earth's lower mantle, is expected to be an essential component of
super-Earths' mantles. Here we present an ab initio investigation of the
structure and magnetic ground state of fp up to $\sim$ 3 TPa with iron
concentrations (x$_{Fe}$) varying from 0.03 to 0.12. Calculations were
performed using LDA+U$_{sc}$ and PBE exchange-correlation functionals to
elucidate the pressure range for which the Hubbard U (U$_{sc}$) is required.
Similar to the end-members FeO and MgO, fp also undergoes a B1 to B2 phase
transition that should be essential for modeling the structure and dynamics of
super-Earths' mantles. This structural transition involves a simultaneous
change in magnetic state from a low spin (LS) B1 phase with iron total spin S=0
to an intermediate spin (IS) B2 phase with S=1. This is a rare form of
pressure/strain-induced magnetism produced by local cation coordination
changes. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of the iron B2-IS
state. Free energy calculations are then carried out including vibrational
effects and electronic and magnetic entropy contributions. The phase diagram is
then obtained for low concentration fp using a quasi-ideal solid solution
model. For x$_{Fe}$ > 0.12 this approach is no longer valid. At ultra-high
pressures, there is an IS to LS spin state change in Fe in the B2 phase, but
the transition pressure depends sensitively on thermal electronic excitations
and on x$_{Fe}$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11008v2
"Longitudinal change in language behaviour during protests: A case study
  of Euromaidan in Ukraine",2021-09-23T20:18:42Z,"Ivan Slobozhan, Tymofii Brik, Rajesh Sharma","In the last decade, online social media has become the primary platform for
protesters to organize and express their agenda in various parts of the world.
Nevertheless, scholars still debate whether online tools induce offline
protests or facilitate them. Unfortunately, studies of protests often lack
panel data and cannot address how particular users change their behaviour over
time in line with the protest agenda. To this end, we analyze a new dataset of
the Facebook page EuroMaydan that was explicitly created to facilitate the
protest in Ukraine from November 2013 to February 2014. Moreover, our analysis
follows this page even after the end of the protest till June 2014. In total,
the dataset includes 26,631 posts and 1,470,593 comments that were generated by
124,790 users during and after the protests. We use this panel data to test how
particular users switch between the two most popular languages of this page:
Ukrainian and Russian. Previous studies have puzzled with language behaviour
during the Ukrainian protest. Although researchers expected to see more
Ukrainian language due to national mobilization, studies discovered that
Ukrainian protesters frequently used Russian, especially after the end of the
protest. A hypothesis was suggested that protesters use language strategically
depending on circumstances (e.g., to maximize outreach). However, previous
studies relied on aggregated data and did not explore the within-subject
variation of language behaviour. Our study adds to this scholarship by adding a
longitudinal analysis of language behaviour. Considering the broader
contribution of this paper, we add to the literature on protests by validating
previous findings derived from surveys that activists change their behaviour to
reflect prior preferences and situational goals rather than modify their
preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11623v1
Modeling Dynamic Attributes for Next Basket Recommendation,2021-09-23T21:31:17Z,"Yongjun Chen, Jia Li, Chenghao Liu, Chenxi Li, Markus Anderle, Julian McAuley, Caiming Xiong","Traditional approaches to next item and next basket recommendation typically
extract users' interests based on their past interactions and associated static
contextual information (e.g. a user id or item category). However, extracted
interests can be inaccurate and become obsolete. Dynamic attributes, such as
user income changes, item price changes (etc.), change over time. Such dynamics
can intrinsically reflect the evolution of users' interests. We argue that
modeling such dynamic attributes can boost recommendation performance. However,
properly integrating them into user interest models is challenging since
attribute dynamics can be diverse such as time-interval aware, periodic
patterns (etc.), and they represent users' behaviors from different
perspectives, which can happen asynchronously with interactions. Besides
dynamic attributes, items in each basket contain complex interdependencies
which might be beneficial but nontrivial to effectively capture. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Attentive network to model Dynamic
attributes (named AnDa). AnDa separately encodes dynamic attributes and basket
item sequences. We design a periodic aware encoder to allow the model to
capture various temporal patterns from dynamic attributes. To effectively learn
useful item relationships, intra-basket attention module is proposed.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11654v1

  Inner Heliosphere Observed by Parker Solar Probe",2021-09-27T02:34:14Z,"Jiansen He, Ying Wang, Xingyu Zhu, Die Duan, Daniel Verscharen, Guoqing Zhao","The solar wind in the inner heliosphere has been observed by Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) to exhibit abundant wave activities. The cyclotron wave modes in
the sense of ions or electrons are among the most crucial wave components.
However, their origin and evolution in the inner heliosphere close to the Sun
remain mysteries. Specifically, it remains unknown whether it is an emitted
signal from the solar atmosphere or an eigenmode growing locally in the
heliosphere due to plasma instability. To address and resolve this controversy,
we must investigate the key quantity of the energy change rate of the wave
mode. We develop a new technique to measure the energy change rate of plasma
waves, and apply this technique to the wave electromagnetic fields measured by
PSP. We provide the wave Poynting flux in the solar wind frame, identify the
wave nature to be the outward propagating fast-magnetosonic/whistler wave mode
instead of the sunward propagating waves. We provide the first evidence for
growth of the fast-magnetosonic/whistler wave mode in the inner heliosphere
based on the derived spectra of the real and imaginary parts of the wave
frequencies. The energy change rate rises and stays at a positive level in the
same wavenumber range as the bumps of the electromagnetic field power spectral
densities, clearly manifesting that the observed fast-magnetosonic/whistler
waves are locally growing to a large amplitude.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12768v1

schools, and it is likely to remain an important part of our lives in the
post-pandemic world. Despite its significance, there has not been any
systematic study characterizing the user-perceived performance of existing
videoconferencing systems other than anecdotal reports. In this paper, we
present a detailed measurement study that compares three major
videoconferencing systems: Zoom, Webex and Google Meet. Our study is based on
48 hours' worth of more than 700 videoconferencing sessions, which were created
with a mix of emulated videoconferencing clients deployed in the cloud, as well
as real mobile devices running from a residential network. We find that the
existing videoconferencing systems vary in terms of geographic scope, which in
turns determines streaming lag experienced by users. We also observe that
streaming rate can change under different conditions (e.g., number of users in
a session, mobile device status, etc), which affects user-perceived streaming
quality. Beyond these findings, our measurement methodology can enable
reproducible benchmark analysis for any types of comparative or longitudinal

"The effects of random and seasonal environmental fluctuations on optimal
  harvesting and stocking",2021-09-27T16:30:25Z,"Alexandru Hening, Ky Q. Tran, Sergiu C. Ungureanu","We analyze the harvesting and stocking of a population that is affected by
random and seasonal environmental fluctuations. The main novelty comes from
having three layers of environmental fluctuations. The first layer is due to
the environment switching at random times between different environmental
states. This is similar to having sudden environmental changes or catastrophes.
The second layer is due to seasonal variation, where there is a significant
change in the dynamics between seasons. Finally, the third layer is due to the
constant presence of environmental stochasticity -- between the seasonal or
random regime switches, the species is affected by fluctuations which can be
modelled by white noise. This framework is more realistic because it can
capture both significant random and deterministic environmental shifts as well
as small and frequent fluctuations in abiotic factors. Our framework also
allows for the price or cost of harvesting to change deterministically and
stochastically, something that is more realistic from an economic point of
view.
  The combined effects of seasonal and random fluctuations make it impossible
to find the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy analytically. We get around
this roadblock by developing rigorous numerical approximations and proving that
they converge to the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy. We apply our methods
to multiple population models and explore how prices, or costs, and
environmental fluctuations influence the optimal harvesting-stocking strategy.
We show that in many situations the optimal way of harvesting and stocking is
not of threshold type.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13169v2
Merger-induced galaxy transformations in the ARTEMIS simulations,2021-09-27T18:00:00Z,"Adam M. Dillamore, Vasily Belokurov, Andreea S. Font, Ian G. McCarthy","Using the ARTEMIS set of 45 high-resolution cosmological simulations, we
investigate a range of merger-induced dynamical transformations of Milky
Way-like galaxies. We first identify populations of accreted stars on highly
radial orbits, similar to the 'Gaia Sausage' in the Milky Way. We show that
$\approx1/3$ of the ARTEMIS galaxies contain a similar feature, and confirm
that they usually comprise stellar debris from the most massive accreted
satellite. Selecting 15 galaxies with discs at the present-day, we study their
changes around the times of the GS-like mergers. Dark matter haloes of many of
these exhibit global changes in shape and orientation, with almost half
becoming significantly more spherical when the mergers occur. Focusing on the
galaxies themselves, we find that 4/15 have stellar discs which experience
large changes in the orientation of their angular momentum (AM) axes, at rates
of up to $\sim60$ degrees Gyr$^{-1}$. By calculating the orbital angular
momentum axes of the satellites before they are accreted, we show that there is
a tendency for the disc's AM to become more aligned with this axis after the
merger. We also investigate the origin of in situ retrograde stars, analogous
to the 'Splash' in the Milky Way. Tracing them back to earlier snapshots, we
demonstrate that they were often disrupted onto their extreme orbits by
multiple early mergers. We also find that the total mass of these stars outside
the central regions positively correlates with the total accreted stellar mass.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13244v2
Designing Counterfactual Generators using Deep Model Inversion,2021-09-29T08:40:50Z,"Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan, Vivek Narayanaswamy, Deepta Rajan, Jason Liang, Akshay Chaudhari, Andreas Spanias","Explanation techniques that synthesize small, interpretable changes to a
given image while producing desired changes in the model prediction have become
popular for introspecting black-box models. Commonly referred to as
counterfactuals, the synthesized explanations are required to contain
discernible changes (for easy interpretability) while also being realistic
(consistency to the data manifold). In this paper, we focus on the case where
we have access only to the trained deep classifier and not the actual training
data. While the problem of inverting deep models to synthesize images from the
training distribution has been explored, our goal is to develop a deep
inversion approach to generate counterfactual explanations for a given query
image. Despite their effectiveness in conditional image synthesis, we show that
existing deep inversion methods are insufficient for producing meaningful
counterfactuals. We propose DISC (Deep Inversion for Synthesizing
Counterfactuals) that improves upon deep inversion by utilizing (a) stronger
image priors, (b) incorporating a novel manifold consistency objective and (c)
adopting a progressive optimization strategy. We find that, in addition to
producing visually meaningful explanations, the counterfactuals from DISC are
effective at learning classifier decision boundaries and are robust to unknown

Application-Platform Co-Design for Serverless Data Processing,2021-10-29T14:41:50Z,"Sebastian Werner, Stefan Tai","""Application-platform co-design"" refers to the phenomenon of new platforms
being created in response to changing application needs, followed by
application design and development changing due to the emergence (and the
specifics, limitations) of the new platforms, therefore creating, again, new
application and platform requirements. This continuous process of application
and platform (re-)design describes an engineering and management responsibility
to constantly evaluate any given platform for application fit and
platform-specific application design, and to consider a new or evolutionary
platform development project due to evolving and changing application needs.
  In this paper, we study this phenomenon in the context of serverless
computing and (big) data processing needs, and thus, for application-platform
co-design for serverless data processing (SDP). We present an analysis of the
state-of-the-art of function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms, which reveals
several configuration, deployment, execution, and measurement differences
between popular platforms happening at-speed. These differences indicate
already ongoing platform (re-)design processes resulting in more specialized
serverless platforms and new, platform-specific challenges for application
design. We discuss data processing needs of applications using the serverless
model and present common initial (and undesirable) workaround solutions on the
application level, giving additional argument to the creation of new SDP
platforms. We present critical SDP requirements and possible new platform
augmentations, but identify the need for engineering methods and tooling to
better guide application-platform co-design. We argue to pay appropriate
attention to the phenomenon of continuous application-platform co-design to
better anticipate and to control future platform and application developments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00933v1
Anisotropic magnetocaloric effect of CrI$_{3}$: A theoretical study,2021-11-03T08:29:19Z,"Hung Ba Tran, Hiroyoshi Momida, Yu-ichiro Matsushita, Koun Shirai, Tamio Oguchi","CrI$_{3}$ is considered to be a promising candidate for spintronic devices
and data storage. We derived the Heisenberg Hamiltonian for CrI$_{3}$ from
density functional calculations using the Liechtenstein formula. Moreover, the
Monte--Carlo simulations with the Sucksmith--Thompson method were performed to
analyze the effect of magnetic anisotropy energy on the thermodynamic
properties. Our method successfully reproduced the negative sign of isothermal
magnetic entropy changes when a magnetic field was applied along the hard
plane. We found that the temperature dependence of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy is not negligible at temperatures slightly above the Curie
temperature. We clarified that the origin of this phenomenon is attributed to
anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and magnetization anisotropy. The
difference between the entropy change of the easy axis and the hard plane is
proportional to the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy,
implying that the anisotropic entropy term is the main source of the
temperature dependence of the free energy difference when magnetizing in a
specific direction other than the easy axis. We also investigated the magnetic
susceptibility that can be used for the characterization of the negative sign
of the entropy change in the case of a hard plane. The competition of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and external magnetic field at low
temperature and low magnetic field region causes a high magnetic susceptibility
as the fluctuation of magnetization. Meanwhile, the anisotropy energy is
suppressed at a sufficient magnetic field applied along the hard axis, the
magnetization is fully rotated to the direction of the external magnetic field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02063v1

  system",2021-11-03T11:14:13Z,"Zhaoyuan Xu, Wei Gong","Recent advances in backscatter open a promising direction for ultra-low power
communication. However, the state-of-art ZigBee backscatter system,
Interscatter, has several drawbacks to deploy. Its backscatter tag and exciting
source, Bluetooth, can hardly decode packets from other ZigBee nodes, which
left Interscatter one-way communication. Besides, it adopts instantaneous phase
change to modulate information, producing obvious sidelobes and interfering
devices working on neighboring channels severely. To address the problems
mentioned above, we introduce Homoscatter, a novel ZigBee backscatter system
that adopts specific ZigBee devices to generate a single tone and leverages
continuous phase change to modulate information, which eliminates spectral
leakage. It also does codeword translation on the packet header of exciting
packets, improving the utilization of ambient signal.
  The prototype of Homoscatter consists of a microchip radio, a backscatter
tag, and a commodity receiver. The evaluations show that the occupied bandwidth
of Homoscatter achieves 3x smaller than Interscatter. When the channel capacity
is 17.5 kbps, the continuous phase change modulation achieves 13 kbps with the
codeword translation on the excitation header. Based on the widely spread IoT
devices, Homoscatter is a practical way to build an efficient connection
between IoT devices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02140v2

epidemiological framework for the systematic mathematical modelling of future
pandemics. Here we stress that we do not have a specific model in mind, but a
whole collection of models which can be transformed into each other, or
represent different aspects of a pandemic, and these aspects can change during
the course of the emergency, as happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. As
conditions for outbreaks in the modern world change on different time-scales,
some rapidly, epidemiology has few 'laws', besides perhaps the fundamental
infection process described by Kermack-McKendrick. Each single of our variety
of models, called framework, is based on a mathematical formulation that we
call a rule-based system. They have several advantages, for example that they
can be both interpreted stochastically and deterministically, without changing
the model structure. Rule-based systems should be easier to communicate to
non-specialists, when compared to differential equations. Due to their
combinatorial nature, the rule-based model framework we propose is ideal for
systematic mathematical modelling, systematic links to statistics, data
analysis in general and also machine learning leading to artificial

the role of magnetic field in the variable emission process in their
relativistic jets. We present here results of our systematic investigation on
the correlation between optical flux and polarization variations for eight
flat-spectrum radio quasars on various timescales using data from the Steward
Observatory that covers a period of $\sim$10 years. On long time scales
($\sim$several months), from a total of 79 observing cycles, in 34 observing
cycles, we found a significant positive correlation between optical flux and
optical polarization degree (PD), negative correlation in 3 cycles and no
correlation in 42 cycles. On short time scales ($\sim$few days), in 47 out of a
total of 55 epochs, we found a positive correlation between optical flux and
PD, while, on the remaining 8 epochs, an anti-correlation was detected between
the two quantities. Moreover, we noticed a significant positive correlation
between optical and $\gamma-$ray fluxes on 14 epochs and a negative correlation
between the two on one epoch. While the observed optical flux changes well fit
in the shock-in-jet model, the observed changes in PD are not explainable by
changes in the power-law spectral index of the relativistic electrons in the
jet. Instead, the observed varied correlations between optical flux and PD
could be due to multi-zone emission regions or the enhanced flux coinciding
with the emergence of a new emission knot with its magnetic field either

changes in pedestrian stress, under different road crossing scenarios in
immersive virtual reality. To measure the stress level of pedestrians, we used
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensors. To collect the required data for the

us to measure participants' stress levels in a controlled environment. The
results suggested that the density of vehicles has a positive effect, meaning
as the density of vehicles increases, so does the stress level for pedestrians.
It was noted that younger pedestrians have a lower amount of stress when
crossing as compared to older pedestrians which have higher amounts of stress.
Geometric variables have an impact on the stress level of pedestrians. The
greater the number of lanes the greater the observed stress, which is due to
the crossing distance increasing, while the walking speed remains the same.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11492v2
A bifurcation threshold for contact-induced language change,2021-11-23T18:21:12Z,Henri Kauhanen,"One proposed mechanism of language change concerns the role played by
second-language (L2) learners in situations of language contact. If
sufficiently many L2 speakers are present in a speech community in relation to
the number of first-language (L1) speakers, then those features which present a
difficulty in L2 acquisition may be prone to disappearing from the language.
This paper presents a mathematical account of such contact situations based on
a stochastic model of learning and nonlinear population dynamics. The
equilibria of a deterministic reduction of the model, describing a mixed
population of L1 and L2 speakers, are fully characterized. Whether or not the
language changes in response to the introduction of L2 learners turns out to
depend on three factors: the overall proportion of L2 learners in the
population, the strength of the difficulty speakers face in acquiring the
language as an L2, and the language-internal utilities of the competing
linguistic variants. These factors are related by a mathematical formula
describing a phase transition from retention of the L2-difficult feature to its
loss from both speaker populations. This supplies predictions that can be
tested against empirical data. Here, the model is evaluated with the help of
two case studies, morphological levelling in Afrikaans and the erosion of null
subjects in Afro-Peruvian Spanish; the model is found to be broadly in
agreement with the historical development in both cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12061v2
Hanson-Wright Inequality for Random Tensors under Einstein Product,2021-11-23T21:54:55Z,Shih Yu Chang,"The Hanson-Wright inequality is an upper bound for tails of real quadratic
forms in independent subgaussian random variables. In this work, we extend the
Hanson-Wright inequality for the maximum eigenvalue of the quadratic sum of
random Hermitian tensors under Einstein product. We first prove Weyl inequality
for tensors under Einstein product and apply this fact to separate the
quadratic form of random Hermitian tensors into diagonal sum and coupling
(non-diagonal) sum parts. For the diagonal part, we can apply Bernstein
inequality to bound the tail probability of the maximum eigenvalue of the sum
of independent random Hermitian tensors directly. For coupling sum part, we
have to apply decoupling method first, i.e., decoupling inequality to bound
expressions with dependent random Hermitian tensors with independent random
Hermitian tensors, before applying Bernstein inequality again to bound the tail
probability of the maximum eigenvalue of the coupling sum of independent random
Hermitian tensors. Finally, the Hanson-Wright inequality for the maximum
eigenvalue of the quadratic sum of random Hermitian tensors under Einstein
product can be obtained by the combination of the bound from the diagonal sum
part and the bound from the coupling (non-diagonal) sum part. In Appendix of

Model systematics in time domain tests of binary black hole evolution,2021-11-26T18:44:29Z,"Shilpa Kastha, Collin D. Capano, Julian Westerweck, Miriam Cabero, Badri Krishnan, Alex B. Nielsen","We perform several consistency tests between different phases of binary black
hole dynamics; the inspiral, the merger, and the ringdown on the gravitational
wave events GW150914 and GW170814. These tests are performed explicitly in the
time domain, without any spectral leakage between the different phases. We
compute posterior distributions on the mass and spin of the initial black holes
and the final black hole. We also compute the initial areas of the two
individual black holes and the final area from the parameters describing the
remnant black hole. This facilitates a test of Hawking's black hole area
theorem. We use different waveform models to quantify systematic waveform
uncertainties for the area increase law with the two events. We find that these
errors may lead to overstating the confidence with which the area theorem is
confirmed. For example, we find $>99\%$ agreement with the area theorem for
GW150914 if a damped sinusoid consisting of a single-mode is used at merger to
estimate the final area. This is because this model overestimates the final
mass. Including an overtone of the dominant mode decreases the confidence to
$\sim94\%$; using a full merger-ringdown model further decreases the confidence
to $\sim 85-90\%$. We find that comparing the measured change in the area to
the expected change in area yields a more robust test, as it also captures over
estimates in the change of area. We find good agreement with GR when applying
this test to GW150914 and GW170814.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13664v1
Method of distinguishing between black holes and wormholes,2021-11-25T05:00:53Z,"Wei Hong, Jun Tao, Tong-Jie Zhang","Beginning with a brief review of the regular space-time with asymptotically
Minkowski core, we can consider two copies of the space-time connected through
a short-throat wormhole whose radius of mouth is equal to or larger than an
extremal regular black hole with asymptotically Minkowski core's event horizon
radius. If the wormhole is traversable and smooth, fluxes in these two
space-times will interact with and flow into each other. On the cosmological
scale, gravity is a candidate for the flux. As the gravitational field changes
in one space-time, the behaviours of stars around the wormhole will be affected
by the other space-time since we assume there exists enough exotic matter to
keep the wormhole open. The changes in a gravitational field can be quantized
through the gauge invariant perturbations. The variances in orbits of stars can
be reflected by changes in the kinematic shifts of photon frequencies. Then, we
use this to distinguish between the black hole and wormhole generated by the
same space-time line element, since black hole can not connect two space-times

static reduction, and in discrete-time classical stochastic control Borkar has
considered this method for partially observed Markov Decision processes

applicable, an absolute continuity condition is necessary. This raises the
following question: can we perturb any discrete-time sequential stochastic
control problem by adding some arbitrarily small additive (e.g. Gaussian or
otherwise) noise to the measurements to make the system measurements absolutely
continuous, so that a change-of-measure (or static reduction) can be applicable
with arbitrarily small error in the optimal cost? That is, are all sequential
stochastic (single-agent or decentralized multi-agent) problems $\epsilon$-away
from being static reducible as far as optimal cost is concerned, for any
$\epsilon > 0$? We show that this is possible when the cost function is bounded

Neptune in the mid-infrared. Dating between 2003 and 2020, the images reveal
changes in Neptune's mid-infrared ($\sim 8-25\mu$m) emission over time in the
years surrounding Neptune's 2005 southern summer solstice. Images sensitive to
stratospheric ethane ($\sim12\mu$m), methane ($\sim8\mu$m), and CH$_3$D
($\sim9\mu$m) display significant sub-seasonal temporal variation on regional
and global scales. Comparison with H$_2$ S(1) hydrogen-quadrupole
($\sim17.035\mu$m) spectra suggests these changes are primarily related to
stratospheric temperature changes. The stratosphere appears to have cooled
between 2003 and 2009 across multiple filtered wavelengths, followed by a
dramatic warming of the south pole between 2018 and 2020. Conversely,
upper-tropospheric temperatures -- inferred from $\sim 17-25$-micron imaging --
appear invariant during this period, except for the south pole, which appeared
warmest between 2003 and 2006. We discuss the observed variability in the
context of seasonal forcing, tropospheric meteorology, and the solar cycle.
Collectively, these data provide the strongest evidence to date that processes
produce sub-seasonal variation on both global and regional scales in Neptune's
stratosphere.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00033v2
PreViTS: Contrastive Pretraining with Video Tracking Supervision,2021-12-01T19:49:57Z,"Brian Chen, Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju, Shih-Fu Chang, Juan Carlos Niebles, Nikhil Naik","Videos are a rich source for self-supervised learning (SSL) of visual
representations due to the presence of natural temporal transformations of
objects. However, current methods typically randomly sample video clips for
learning, which results in an imperfect supervisory signal. In this work, we
propose PreViTS, an SSL framework that utilizes an unsupervised tracking signal
for selecting clips containing the same object, which helps better utilize
temporal transformations of objects. PreViTS further uses the tracking signal
to spatially constrain the frame regions to learn from and trains the model to
locate meaningful objects by providing supervision on Grad-CAM attention maps.
To evaluate our approach, we train a momentum contrastive (MoCo) encoder on
VGG-Sound and Kinetics-400 datasets with PreViTS. Training with PreViTS
outperforms representations learnt by contrastive strategy alone on video
downstream tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on action
classification. PreViTS helps learn feature representations that are more
robust to changes in background and context, as seen by experiments on datasets
with background changes. Learning from large-scale videos with PreViTS could
lead to more accurate and robust visual feature representations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00804v2
Changepoint Analysis of Topic Proportions in Temporal Text Data,2021-11-29T17:20:51Z,"Avinandan Bose, Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee","Changepoint analysis deals with unsupervised detection and/or estimation of
time-points in time-series data, when the distribution generating the data
changes. In this article, we consider \emph{offline} changepoint detection in
the context of large scale textual data. We build a specialised temporal topic
model with provisions for changepoints in the distribution of topic
proportions. As full likelihood based inference in this model is
computationally intractable, we develop a computationally tractable approximate
inference procedure. More specifically, we use sample splitting to estimate
topic polytopes first and then apply a likelihood ratio statistic together with
a modified version of the wild binary segmentation algorithm of Fryzlewicz et
al. (2014). Our methodology facilitates automated detection of structural
changes in large corpora without the need of manual processing by domain
experts. As changepoints under our model correspond to changes in topic
structure, the estimated changepoints are often highly interpretable as marking
the surge or decline in popularity of a fashionable topic. We apply our
procedure on two large datasets: (i) a corpus of English literature from the
period 1800-1922 (Underwoodet al., 2015); (ii) abstracts from the High Energy
Physics arXiv repository (Clementet al., 2019). We obtain some historically

"Linking Solar Minimum, Space Weather, and Night Sky Brightness",2021-12-03T01:22:05Z,"Albert D. Grauer, Patricia A. Grauer","This paper presents time series observations and analysis of broadband night
sky airglow intensity 4 September 2018 through 30 April 2020. Data were
obtained at 5 sites spanning more than 8500 km during the historically deep
minimum of Solar Cycle 24 into the beginning of Solar Cycle 25. New time series
observations indicate previously unrecognized significant sources of broadband
night sky brightness variations, not involving corresponding changes in the
Sun's 10.7cm solar flux, occur during deep solar minimum. Even during a deep
solar minimum the natural night sky is rarely, if ever, constant in brightness.
Changes with time scales of minutes, hours, days, and months are observed.
Semiannual night sky brightness variations are coincident with changes in the
orientation of Earth's magnetic field relative to the interplanetary magnetic
field. Solar wind plasma streams from solar coronal holes arriving at Earth's
bow shock nose are coincident with major night sky brightness increase events.
Sites more than 8500 km along the Earth's surface experience nights in common
with either very bright or very faint night sky airglow emissions. The reason
for this observational fact remains an open question. It is plausible,
terrestrial night airglow and geomagnetic indices have similar responses to the
solar energy input into Earth's magnetosphere. Our empirical results contribute
to a quantitative basis for understanding and predicting broadband night sky
brightness variations. They are applicable in astronomical, planetary science,
space weather, light pollution, biological, and recreational studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01664v1
The Three Hundred: Cluster Dynamical States and Relaxation Time Scale,2021-12-03T13:51:11Z,"Bowei Zhang, Weiguang Cui, Romeel Dave, Marco De Petris","Using the galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project, we define a new
parameter: $\lambda_{DS}$ to describe the dynamical state of clusters, which
assumes a double-Gaussian distribution in logarithm scale for our mass-complete
cluster sample at $z=0$ from the dark-matter-only (DMO) run. Therefore, the
threshold for distinguishing relaxed and unrelaxed clusters is naturally
determined by the crossing point of the double-Gaussian fitting which has a
value of $\lambda_{DS} = 3.424$. By applying $\lambda_{DS}$ with the same
parameters from the DMO run to the hydro-dynamically simulated clusters
(Gadget-X run and GIZMO-SIMBA run), we investigate the effect of baryons on the
cluster dynamical state. We find a weak baryon-model dependence for the
$\lambda_{DS}$ parameter. Finally, we study the evolution of $\lambda_{DS}$
along with clusters mass accretion history. We notice an upper limit of halo
mass change $\frac{\Delta M_{200}}{M_{200}} \sim 0.12$ that don't alter the
cluster dynamical state, i.e. from relaxed to unrelaxed. We define relaxation
period (from the most relaxed state to disturb and relaxed again) which
reflects how long the dynamical state of a cluster restores its relaxation
state, and propose a correlation between this relaxation period and the
strength of halo mass change $\frac{\Delta M_{200}}{M_{200}}$. With the
proposed fitting to such correlation, we verify the relaxation period can be
estimated from $\frac{\Delta M_{200}}{M_{200}}$ (including multi mass change
peaks) with considerably small error.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01909v2
"Energy transfer mechanisms in adverse pressure gradient turbulent
  boundary layers",2021-12-06T12:50:15Z,"Taygun R. Gungor, Yvan Maciel, Ayse G. Gungor","The energy transfer mechanisms and structures playing a role in these
mechanisms in adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs)
with small and large velocity defects are investigated. We examine the
wall-normal and spectral distributions of energy, production and
pressure-strain in APG TBLs and compare these distributions with those in
canonical flows. It is found that the spectral distributions of production and
pressure-strain are not profoundly affected by an increase of the velocity
defect, although the energy spectra drastically change in the inner layer of
the large defect APG TBL. In the latter, the signature of the inner layer
streaks is absent from the energy spectra. However, the production and
pressure-strain spectra suggest that the near-wall cycle or another energy
transfer mechanism with similar spectral features still exist in large defect
TBLs. In the outer layer, energetic, production and pressure-strain structures
appear to change from wall-attached to wall-detached structures with increasing
velocity defect. Despite this, the 2D spectral distributions have similar
shapes and wavelength aspect ratios of the peaks in all these flows. These
observations suggest that outer layer energy transfer mechanisms may be the
same in wall-bounded flows, no matter if dynamically relevant structures are
attached or detached to the wall. Therefore, the conclusion is that the
mechanisms responsible for turbulence production and inter-component energy
transfer may remain the same within each layer in all these flows. It is the
intensity of these mechanisms within one layer that changes with velocity
defect, because of the local mean shear variation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02980v1
Understanding Distributed Tutorship in Online Language Tutoring,2021-12-07T05:19:35Z,"Meng Xia, Yankun Zhao, Mehmet Hamza Erol, Jihyeong Hong, Juho Kim","With the rise of the gig economy, online language tutoring platforms are

tutors and learners from building long-term trust. ""Distributed tutorship"" --
temporally discontinuous learning experience with different tutors -- has been
underexplored yet has many implications for modern learning platforms. In this
paper, we analyzed tutorship sequences of 15,959 learners and found that around
40% of learners change to new tutors every session; 44% learners change to new
tutors while reverting to previous tutors sometimes; only 16% learners change
to new tutors and then fix on one tutor. We also found suggestive evidence that
higher distributedness -- higher diversity and lower continuity in tutorship --
is correlated to slower improvements in speaking performance scores with a
similar number of sessions. We further surveyed 519 and interviewed 40 learners
and found that more learners preferred fixed tutorship while some do not have
it due to various reasons. Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews
with three tutors and one product manager to discuss the implications for
improving the continuity in learning under distributed tutorship.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03500v4
"The activity of the dwarf nova RU Pegasi with rapidly changing outburst
  types",2021-12-07T10:37:07Z,Vojtech Simon,"RU Peg is a dwarf nova (DN) of the U Gem type. Our analysis of its long-term
optical activity uses the data from the AAVSO database. It concentrates on
investigating the properties of the individual outbursts and the time evolution
of the ensemble of these events. No significant irradiation of the disc by the
white dwarf was detected. In the interpretation, a variable steepness of the
rising branches of the individual outbursts shows that the start of outbursts
of RU Peg can occur at various distances from the disc centre without
remarkable changes of the outburst recurrence time $T_{\rm C}$. The disc
overflow of the inflowing mass stream, varying with time, could contribute to
the changes in the starting position of the heating front, hence the variations
of the outburst types. A typical length of $T_{\rm C}$ was 90 days. The
segments of the relatively stable length of $T_{\rm C}$ were accompanied by the
primarily little variable and small values of the fluence (the energy radiated
in the optical band in the individual outbursts). Jumps of $T_{\rm C}$,
accompanied by the big scatter of the fluences, sometimes replaced them. In the
interpretation, a combination of variations of $T_{\rm C}$ with the unstable
properties of the outbursts, including an unstable mass transfer rate between
the components, shows the influence of several mechanisms on the state of the
disc in various time segments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03620v1

strong spin-orbit coupling and show some properties characteristic of linearly
polarized light. We consider a $t_{2g}$-orbital Hubbard model driven by
circularly or linearly polarized light with strong spin-orbit coupling and
derive its effective Hamiltonian in the strong-interaction limit for a
high-frequency case. We show that linearly polarized light can change not only
the magnitudes and signs of the exchange interactions, but also their bond
anisotropy even without the bond-anisotropic hopping integrals. Because of this
property, the honeycomb-network spin system could be transformed into weakly
coupled zigzag or step spin chains for the light field polarized along the $b$-
or $a$-axis, respectively. Then, analyzing how the light fields affect several
magnetic states in a mean-field approximation, we show that linearly polarized
light can change the relative stability of the competing magnetic states,
whereas such a change is absent for circularly polarized light. We also analyze
the effects of both the bond anisotropy of nearest-neighbor hopping integrals
and a third-neighbor hopping integral on the magnetic states and show that the
results obtained in a simple model, in which the bond-averaged nearest-neighbor
hopping integrals are considered, remain qualitatively unchanged except for the
stability of zigzag states in the non-driven case and the degeneracy lifting of
the zigzag or stripy states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04690v1

proposed [Klushin et al, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 074904 (2021)] where the
brush-forming chains have an affinity to the substrate. For sufficiently strong
surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a near-surface layer,
while the remaining ones form the outer brush with a reduced grafting density.
The dense layer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting
microphases. The effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by
the adsorption strength and can be changed reversibly as a response to changes
in environmental parameters.
  In this paper we use numerical self-consistent field calculations and
theoretical considerations to study this phenomenon in polydisperse brushes.
Our results reveal an unexpected effect: Although all chains are chemically
identical, shorter chains are adsorbed preferentially. Hence, with the increase
in the surface affinity parameter, a reduction in the surface grafting density
of the residual brush is accompanied by a change in the shape of its molecular
mass distribution. In particular, an originally bidisperse brush can be
effectively transformed into a nearly monodisperse one containing only the

AI-Empowered Persuasive Video Generation: A Survey,2021-12-17T09:24:12Z,"Chang Liu, Han Yu","Promotional videos are rapidly becoming a popular medium for persuading

video generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is
interdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to

understanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs)
relevant to the target of promotion; 2) visual storyline generation, which
shortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a
storyline with persuasive power; and 3) post-production, which involves
background music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing

Dynamics-aware Adversarial Attack of 3D Sparse Convolution Network,2021-12-17T10:53:35Z,"An Tao, Yueqi Duan, He Wang, Ziyi Wu, Pengliang Ji, Haowen Sun, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","In this paper, we investigate the dynamics-aware adversarial attack problem

recently proposed networks, e.g. 3D sparse convolution network, which contains
input-dependent execution to improve computational efficiency. It results in a
serious issue of lagged gradient, making the learned attack at the current step
ineffective due to the architecture changes afterward. To address this issue,
we propose a Leaded Gradient Method (LGM) and show the significant effects of
the lagged gradient. More specifically, we re-formulate the gradients to be
aware of the potential dynamic changes of network architectures, so that the
learned attack better ""leads"" the next step than the dynamics-unaware methods

Tracing Accretion onto Herbig Ae/Be Stars Using the BrÎ³ Line,2021-12-20T10:16:54Z,"Sierra L. Grant, Catherine C. Espaillat, Sean Brittain, Caleb Scott-Joseph, Nuria Calvet","Accretion plays an important role in protoplanetary disk evolution, and it is
thought that the accretion mechanism changes between low- and high-mass stars.
Here, we characterize accretion in intermediate-mass, pre-main-sequence Herbig
Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars to search for correlations between accretion and system
properties. We present new high-resolution, near-infrared spectra from the
Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph for 102 HAeBes and analyze the
accretion-tracing Br$\gamma$ line at 2.166 $\mu$m. We also include the samples
of Fairlamb et al. and Donehew & Brittain, for a total of 155 targets. We find
a positive correlation between the Br$\gamma$ and stellar luminosity, with a
change in the slope between the Herbig Aes and Herbig Bes. We use
$L_{Br\gamma}$ to determine the accretion luminosity and accretion rate. We
find that the accretion luminosity and rate depend on stellar mass and age;
however, the trend disappears when normalizing the accretion luminosity by the
stellar luminosity. We classify the objects into flared (Group I) or flat
(Group II) disks and find that there is no trend with accretion luminosity or
rate, indicating that the disk dust structure is not impacting accretion. We
test for Br$\gamma$ variability in objects that are common to our sample and
previous studies. We find that the Br$\gamma$ line equivalent width is largely
consistent between the literature observations and those that we present here,

Comments on the Aharonov-Bohm Effect,2021-12-21T13:09:07Z,"Kazuyasu Shigemoto, Kunihiko Uehara","In the original setting of the Aharonov-Bohm, the gauge invariant physical
longitudinal mode of the vector potential, which is written by the gauge
invariant physical current $(-e)\bar{\psi}{\boldsymbol \gamma} \psi$, gives the
desired contribution to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. While the scalar mode of the
vector potential, which changes under the gauge transformation so that it is
the unphysical mode, give no contribution to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Then
Aharonov-Bohm effect really occurs by the physical longitudinal mode in the
original Aharonov-Bohm's setting. In the setting of Tonomura {\it et al.},
where the magnet is shielded with the superconducting material, not only the
magnetic field but also the longitudinal mode of the vector potential become
massive by the Meissner effect. Then not only the magnetic field but also the
physical longitudinal mode does not come out to the region where the electron
travels. In such setting, only the scalar mode of the vector potential exists
in the region where the electron travels, but there is no contribution to the
Aharonov-Bohm effect from that mode. Then, theoretically, the Aharonov-Bohm
effect does not occur in the Tonomura {\it et al.}'s setting. In the quantum
theory, the electron is treated as the wave, and the longitudinal mode give the
change of the phase, which gives the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In the classical
theory, the electron is treated as the particle, and the only existing
longitudinal mode gives the change of the angular momentum. For the particle,
there is no concept of the phase, so that there is no Aharonov-Bohm effect.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11171v2
Dynamical impact of the Mekong River plume in the South China Sea,2021-12-21T14:27:14Z,"Xiyuan Zeng, Annalisa Bracco, Filippos Tagklis","Near the ocean surface, river plumes influence stratification, buoyancy and
transport of tracers, nutrients and pollutants. The extent to which river
plumes influence the overall circulation, however, is generally poorly
constrained. This work focuses on the South China Sea (SCS) and quantifies the
dynamical impacts of the Mekong River plume, which is bound to significantly
change in strength and seasonality in the next 20 years if the construction of
over hundred dams moves ahead as planned. The dynamic impact of the freshwater
fluxes on the SCS circulation are quantified by comparing submesoscale
permitting and mesoscale resolving simulations with and without riverine input
between 2011 and 2016. In the summer and early fall, when the Mekong discharge
is at its peak, the greater stratification causes a residual mesoscale
circulation through enhanced baroclinic instability. The residual circulation
is shaped as an eddy train of positive and negative vorticity. Submesoscale
fronts are responsible for transporting the freshwater offshore, shifting
eastward the development of the residual mesoscale circulation, and further
strengthening the residual eddy train in the submesoscale permitting case.
Overall, the northward transport near the surface is intensified in the
presence of riverine input. The significance of the mesoscale-induced and
submesoscale-induced transport associated with the river plume is especially
important in in the second half of the summer monsoon season, when primary
productivity has a secondary maximum. Circulation changes, and therefore
productivity changes, should be anticipated if human activities modify the
intensity and seasonality of the Mekong River plume.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11252v1
Ab initio investigation of H-bond disordering in $Î´$-AlOOH,2021-12-21T17:18:37Z,"Chenxing Luo, Koichiro Umemoto, Renata M. Wentzcovitch","$\delta$-AlOOH ($\delta$) is a high-pressure hydrous phase that participates
in the deep geological water cycle. At 0 GPa, $\delta$ has asymmetric hydrogen
bonds (H-bonds). Under pressure, it exhibits H-bond disordering, tunneling, and
finally, H-bond symmetrization at ~18 GPa. This study investigates these 300 K
pressure-induced state changes in $\delta$ with ab initio calculations. H-bond
disordering in $\delta$ was modeled using supercell multi-configuration
quasiharmonic calculations. We examine: (a) energy barriers for proton jumps,
(b) the pressure dependence of phonon frequencies, (c) 300 K compressibility,
(d) neutron diffraction pattern anomalies, and (e) compare ab initio bond
lengths with measured ones. Such thorough and systematic comparisons indicate
that: (a) proton ""disorder"" has a restricted meaning when applied to $\delta$.
Nevertheless, H-bonds are disordered between 0 and 8 GPa, and a gradual change
in H-bond configuration results in enhanced compressibility. (b) several
structural and vibrational anomalies at ~8 GPa are consistent with the
disappearance of a particular (HOC-12) H-bond configuration and its change into
another one (HOC-11*). (c) between 8-11 GPa, H-bond configuration (HOC-11*) is
generally ordered, at least in short- to mid-range scale. (d) between 11.5-18
GPa, H-bond lengths approach a critical value that impedes compression,
resulting in decreased compressibility. In this pressure range, especially
approaching H-bond symmetrization at ~18 GPa, anharmonicity and tunneling
should play an essential role in the proton dynamics. Further simulations
accounting for these effects are desirable to clarify the protons' state in

archaeological inferences for a large sample of ""red and dead"" Elliptical

their 2D stellar light and mass maps, we explore the differences between the
radial mass and light distributions in the rest-frame bands $g,$ $r,$ and $i$
as functions of look-back time, $t_{\rm lb}$, or redshift, $z$. We characterize
these differences through the ratios between the following mass- and
light-derived global properties: sizes, concentrations, and effective surface
densities. We find that the mass-to-light ratios of these properties change
with $t_{\rm lb}$, more the more massive the galaxies are. The CLE galaxy
archaeological progenitors are, on average, less compact, concentrated, and
dense in light than in mass as $z$ decreases. However, at later times, when
also the evolution of the progenitors becomes passive at all radii, there is an
upturn in these trends and the differences between mass and light in
compactness/concentration decrease towards $z\sim 0$. The trends in the ratios
of mass to light sizes agree qualitatively with results from direct
observations in galaxy surveys at different redshifts. We discuss the caveats
and interpretations of our results, and speculate that the strong structural
evolution found in some previous studies for early-type galaxies could be
explained partially by photometric changes rather than by intrinsic structural

anisotropy of V$_2$O$_3$/Ni bilayers. This is caused by the rhombohedral to
monoclinic structural phase transition of V$_2$O$_3$ at $T_C$ = 160 K. The
in-plane magnetic anisotropy is uniaxial above $T_C$, but as the bilayer is
cooled through the structural phase transition, a secondary magnetic easy axis
emerges. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements show that this change in magnetic
anisotropy is reversible with temperature. We identify two structural
properties of the V$_2$O$_3$/Ni bilayers affecting the in-plane magnetic
anisotropy: (1) a growth-induced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy associated with
step-like terraces in the bilayer microstructure and (2) a low-temperature
strain-induced biaxial anisotropy associated with the V$_2$O$_3$ structural
phase transition. Magnetoresistance measurements corroborate the change in
magnetic anisotropy across the structural transition and suggest that the
negative magnetostriction of Ni leads to the emergence of a strain-induced

the unusual change in the $c/a$ ratio of the trigonal lattice. The large
compressibility and observed Raman anomalies indicate to a soft material with
strong electron-phonon coupling. The observed below bandgap broadband emission
in the photoluminescence measurement indicates the recombination of
self-trapped excitons. The initial blueshift of the photoluminescence peak
reinforces itself to the redshift at around 3 GPa due to the change in the
electronic landscape. A first order trigonal to a monoclinic structural
transition is also seen at 8 GPa. The first-principles density functional

"Optimal shape of STIRAP pulses for large dissipation at the intermediate
  level",2021-12-27T11:52:06Z,"Dionisis Stefanatos, Emmanuel Paspalakis","We study the problem of maximizing population transfer efficiency in the
STIRAP system for the case where the dissipation rate of the intermediate state
is much higher than the maximum amplitude of the control fields. Under this
assumption, the original three-level system can be reduced to a couple of
equations involving the initial and target states only. We find the control
fields which maximize the population transfer to the target state for a given
duration $T$, without using any penalty involving the population of the lossy
intermediate state, but under the constraint that the sum of the intensities of
the pump and Stokes pulses is constant, so the total field has constant
amplitude and the only control parameter is the mixing angle of the two fields.
In the optimal solution the mixing angle changes in the bang-singular-bang
manner, where the initial and final bangs correspond to equal instantaneous
rotations, while the intermediate singular arc to a linear change with time. We
show that the optimal angle of the initial and final rotations is the unique
solution of a transcendental equation where duration $T$ appears as a
parameter, while the optimal slope of the intermediate linear change as well as
the optimal transfer efficiency are expressed as functions of this optimal
angle. The corresponding optimal solution recovers the counterintuitive
pulse-sequence, with nonzero pump and Stokes fields at the boundaries. We also
show with numerical simulations that, transfer efficiency values close to the
optimal derived using the approximate system, can also be obtained with the
original STIRAP system using dissipation rates comparable to the maximum
control amplitude.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13620v1

many countries like Finland, Denmark, and South Korea. Bangladesh Government
has also launched the creative curriculum system in 2009 in both primary and
secondary levels, where changes have been made in educational contents and exam

memorization and less creativity and increase the students' level of

examinations, including entrance hall exams in universities and board
examinations. This deteriorating situation is mostly for leakage of question

Control of dynamic systems with restrictions on input and output signals,2021-12-28T12:49:18Z,"Igor Furtat, Pavel Gushchin, Nguyen Ba Huy","The paper considers the generalization of the method proposed by I.B. Furtat,

an arbitrary ratio of the number of input and output signals and with a
guarantee of their being in a given set. To solve the problem, two coordinate
changes are proposed. The first coordinate change reduces the output variable
of the system to a new variable which dimension does not exceed the control
dimension. The second coordinate change allows one to pass from a constrained
control problem to an unconstrained one. In order to illustrate the efficiency
of the method, the solution of two problems is considered. The first task is
state feedback control of linear systems, taking into account the constraints
on the control signal and phase variables. The second task is output feedback
control of linear systems with a restriction on output and control. In both

Skin feature point tracking using deep feature encodings,2021-12-28T14:29:08Z,"Jose Ramon Chang, TorbjÃ¶rn E. M. Nordling","Facial feature tracking is a key component of imaging ballistocardiography
(BCG) where accurate quantification of the displacement of facial keypoints is
needed for good heart rate estimation. Skin feature tracking enables
video-based quantification of motor degradation in Parkinson's disease.
Traditional computer vision algorithms include Scale Invariant Feature
Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Lucas-Kanade method
(LK). These have long represented the state-of-the-art in efficiency and
accuracy but fail when common deformations, like affine local transformations
or illumination changes, are present.
  Over the past five years, deep convolutional neural networks have
outperformed traditional methods for most computer vision tasks. We propose a
pipeline for feature tracking, that applies a convolutional stacked autoencoder
to identify the most similar crop in an image to a reference crop containing
the feature of interest. The autoencoder learns to represent image crops into
deep feature encodings specific to the object category it is trained on.
  We train the autoencoder on facial images and validate its ability to track
skin features in general using manually labeled face and hand videos. The
tracking errors of distinctive skin features (moles) are so small that we
cannot exclude that they stem from the manual labelling based on a
$\chi^2$-test. With a mean error of 0.6-4.2 pixels, our method outperformed the
other methods in all but one scenario. More importantly, our method was the
only one to not diverge.
  We conclude that our method creates better feature descriptors for feature
tracking, feature matching, and image registration than the traditional
algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14159v2
Can varying the gravitational constant alleviate the tensions ?,2021-12-28T15:02:15Z,"Ziad Sakr, Domenico Sapone","Constraints on the cosmological concordance model parameters from observables
at different redshifts are usually obtained using the locally measured value of
the gravitational constant $G_N$. Here we relax this assumption, by considering
$G$ as a free parameter, either constant over the redshift range or dynamical
but limited to differ from fiducial value only above a certain redshift. Using
CMB data and distance measurements from galaxy clustering BAO feature, we
constrain the cosmological parameters, along with $G$, through a MCMC bayesian
inference method. Furthermore, we investigate whether the tensions on the
matter fluctuation $\sigma_8$ and Hubble $H_0$ parameter could be alleviated by
this new variable. We used different parameterisations spanning from a constant
$G$ to a dynamical $G$. In all the cases investigated in this work we found no
mechanism that alleviates the tensions when both CMB and BAO data are used with
$\xi_{\mathrm{g}} = G / G_N$ constrained to 1.0$\pm0.04$ (resp. $\pm0.01$) in
the constant (resp. dynamical) case. Finally, we studied the cosmological
consequences of allowing a running of the spectral index, since the later is
sensitive to a change in $G$. For the two parameterisations adopted, we found
no significant changes to the previous conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14173v2
Quantum tunneling in the presence of a topology-changing fermionic bath,2021-12-28T19:39:58Z,"Elis Roberts, Jan Behrends, Benjamin BÃ©ri","Coupling a quantum particle to a fermionic bath suppresses the particle's
amplitude to tunnel, even at zero temperature. While this effect can generally
be neglected for gapped baths -- a key feature for superconducting qubits -- ,
it is possible for the bath to be gapped near the potential minima between
which the particle tunnels, but different minima to correspond to different
bath topologies. This enforces the bath to undergo gap closing along the
tunneling path. In this work, we investigate quantum tunneling in the presence
of such a topology-changing fermionic bath. We develop a field theory for this
problem, linking the instantons describing tunneling in a bath of $d$ space
dimensions to topological boundary modes of systems in $d+1$ dimensions, thus
stepping a level higher in a dimensional hierarchy. We study in detail a $d=1$
example, inspired by planar Josephson junctions where the particle coordinate
is the superconducting phase whose value sets the electronic topology. We find
that the topology change suppresses tunneling by a factor scaling exponentially
with the system size. This translates to a correspondingly enhanced suppression
of the energy splitting for the lowest-lying states, despite these being linear
combinations of states near potential minima where the bath is gapped. Our
results help to estimate the influence of charging energy on topological phases
arising due to the Josephson effect and, conversely, to assess the potential
utility of such topological systems as superconducting qubits. For
moderate-sized baths, the incomplete suppression of tunneling opens the
prospects of quantum-mechanical superpositions of many-body states of different
topology, including superpositions of states with and without Majorana
fermions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14280v1
"Technology, Institution, and Regional Growth: Evidence from Mineral
  Mining Industry in Industrializing Japan",2021-12-29T11:47:08Z,Kota Ogasawara,"Coal extraction was an influential economic activity in interwar Japan.
Initially, coal mines employed both males and females as the workforce in the
pits. However, the innovation of labor-saving technologies and the renewal of
traditional extraction methodology induced institutional change. This was
manifested by the revision of labor regulations affecting female miners in the
early 1930s. This dramatically changed the mining workplace, making skilled
males the principal miners engaged in underground work. This paper investigates
the impact of coal mining on regional growth and assesses how the institutional
changes induced by the amended labor regulations affected its processes. By
linking the mines' location information with both registration and census-based
statistics, it was found that coal mines led to remarkable population growth.
Fertility rate increased following the implementation of labor regulations that
required female miners to leave the workforce and start families. The
regulations prohibited female miners from risky underground work. This
reduction in occupational hazard also improved early-life mortality via the
mortality selection mechanism in utero.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14514v15
"Non-uniform magnetization profile in ferromagnetic heterostructures
  leading to topological Hall effect like signatures",2021-12-30T11:49:14Z,"Nandana Bhattacharya, S. Middey","Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), which arises when a current is passed through a
ferromagnetic material subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, is
proportional to the magnetization of the sample.Additional hump-like features
in AHE are often attributed to the presence of non trivial spin textures
leading to topological Hall effect (THE). However, several recent reports have
emphasized in context of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ based heterostructures that
the sample inhomogeneity can also result in THE-like features. In order to
investigate this issue in general for any ferromagnetic heterostructure, we
have considered a phenomenological model to calculate the changes in the shape
of hysteresis loop due to various interfacial effects. These changes in the
magnetization have been accounted for by considering that the interdomain
magnetic coupling parameter ($\alpha$) varies exponentially with the distance
from the interface along the growth direction of the heterostructure. In case
of symmetric interfaces on both sides of a ferromagnet, we have considered the
variation of $\alpha$ as a Gaussian function. We have found that the additional
AHE contribution due to the net change in magnetization in such cases are akin
to experimentally observed THE, even though we have not considered any
topological quantity explicitly in our model. Thus, we propose another
situation with nonuniform magnetization profile that may be used to explain
additional features in AHE, which might not necessarily be intrinsic THE.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15020v1
"Power Under Multiplicity Project (PUMP): Estimating Power, Minimum
  Detectable Effect Size, and Sample Size When Adjusting for Multiple Outcomes
  in Multi-level Experiments",2021-12-31T02:50:42Z,"Kristen Hunter, Luke Miratrix, Kristin Porter","For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a single intervention being
measured on multiple outcomes, researchers often apply a multiple testing
procedure (such as Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) to adjust $p$-values. Such
an adjustment reduces the likelihood of spurious findings, but also changes the
statistical power, sometimes substantially, which reduces the probability of
detecting effects when they do exist. However, this consideration is frequently
ignored in typical power analyses, as existing tools do not easily accommodate
the use of multiple testing procedures. We introduce the PUMP R package as a
tool for analysts to estimate statistical power, minimum detectable effect
size, and sample size requirements for multi-level RCTs with multiple outcomes.
Multiple outcomes are accounted for in two ways. First, power estimates from
PUMP properly account for the adjustment in $p$-values from applying a multiple
testing procedure. Second, as researchers change their focus from one outcome
to multiple outcomes, different definitions of statistical power emerge. PUMP
allows researchers to consider a variety of definitions of power, as some may
be more appropriate for the goals of their study. The package estimates power
for frequentist multi-level mixed effects models, and supports a variety of
commonly-used RCT designs and models and multiple testing procedures. In
addition to the main functionality of estimating power, minimum detectable
effect size, and sample size requirements, the package allows the user to
easily explore sensitivity of these quantities to changes in underlying
assumptions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15273v3
T-Plots: A Novel Approach to Network Design,2021-12-09T11:17:34Z,Itamar Cohen,"It is accepted wisdom that changes in the traffic matrix entail capacity
over-provisioning, but there is no simple measure of just how much
over-provisioning can buy. In this Thesis, we aim to provide the network
designer with a simple view of the network robustness to traffic matrix
changes. We first present the Traffic Load Distribution Plots, or T-Plots, a
class of plots illustrating the percentage of traffic matrices that can be
serviced as a function of the capacity over-provisioning. For instance, from a
simple look at their T- Plots, network designers can guarantee that their
network services all admissible traffic matrices, or 99% of permutation traffic
matrices, or all traffic matrices with ingress/egress load at most half the
maximum. We further show that, unfortunately, in the general case plotting
T-Plots is #P-Complete, i.e., that it is impossible to plot a T-plot in a
polynomial time by the noon tools. However, we show that T-Plots can sometimes
be closely modeled as Gaussian, thus only using two values (mean and variance)
to quantify the robustness of a capacity allocation to traffic matrix changes.
We further utilize these Gaussian T-Plots to provide a more robust capacity
allocation. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of using T-Plots by showing
results of extensive Monte Carlo simulations in a real backbone network. This
Thesis was submitted in 2007. Since then, the results that appeared in it were
applied in various networking environments. In this newer version, we revisit
the results 13 years later and explain their relevance to state-of-the-art

experienced close interactions with other ovals, merging with another oval in
February 2013; it has also experienced color changes, from white to red

Temperate Belt Disturbance, which occurred in October 2016 and fully covered
the oval, rendering it unobservable for a short time. When it became visible
again at its expected longitude from its previous longitudinal track, it
reappeared as a white large oval keeping this color and the same morphology

used HST and PlanetCam-UPV/EHU multi-wavelength observations to characterize
its color changes and Junocam images to unveil its detailed structure. The

redder clouds than its environment but has lower cloud tops than other large
ovals like the GRS, and it is less red than the GRS and oval BA. We show that

observations collected in 2000 and 2014, simultaneously fitting the reflection
grating spectrometer (RGS) and EPIC-pn spectra of each epoch, for the first
time, with the photoionisation model, PION, in SPEX. We find that four PION
components are required to fit the majority of the emission lines in the
spectra of NGC 1068, with $\log \xi=1-4$, $\log N_H>26 m^{-2}$, and
$v_{out}=-100$ to $-600 kms^{-1}$ for both epochs. Comparing the ionisation
state of the components shows almost no difference between the two epochs,
while there is an increase in the total column density. To estimate the
locations of these plasma regions from the central black hole we compare
distance methods, excluding the variability arguments as there is no spectral
change between observations. Although the methods are unable to constrain the
distances, the locations are consistent with the narrow line region, with the
possibility of the higher ionised component being part of the broad line
region, but we cannot conclude this for certain. In addition, we find evidence
for emission from collisionally ionised plasma, while previous analysis had
suggested that collisional plasma emission was unlikely. However, although PION
is unable to account for the FeXVII emission lines at 15 and 17 \AA, we do not
rule out that photoexcitation is a valid processes to produce these lines too.
NGC 1068 has not changed, both in terms of the observed spectra or from our

that the ELRs are fairly static relative to the 14 year time frame between

recently challenged by the discovery of the so-called changing-state
(changing-look) AGNs (CSAGNs). The physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is
still a matter of open debate and the samples are too small and of
serendipitous nature to provide robust answers. In order to tackle this
problem, we need to design methods that are able to detect AGN right in the act
of changing-state. Here we present an anomaly detection (AD) technique designed
to identify AGN light curves with anomalous behaviors in massive datasets. The
main aim of this technique is to identify CSAGN at different stages of the
transition, but it can also be used for more general purposes, such as cleaning
massive datasets for AGN variability analyses. We used light curves from the
Zwicky Transient Facility data release 5 (ZTF DR5), containing a sample of
230,451 AGNs of different classes. The ZTF DR5 light curves were modeled with a
Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture, that allowed us to
obtain a set of attributes from the VRAE latent space that describes the
general behaviour of our sample. These attributes were then used as features
for an Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm, that is an anomaly detector for a ""one
class"" kind of problem. We used the VRAE reconstruction errors and the IF
anomaly score to select a sample of 8,809 anomalies. These anomalies are
dominated by bogus candidates, but we were able to identify 75 promising CSAGN
candidates.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07660v2
"Role of surface termination in the metal-insulator transition of
  V$_2$O$_3$(0001) ultrathin films",2021-06-16T05:15:51Z,"Asish K. Kundu, Sukanta Barman, Krishnakumar S. R. Menon","Surface termination is known to play an important role in determining the
physical properties of materials. It is crucial to know how surface termination
affects the metal-insulator transition (MIT) of V$_2$O$_3$ films for both
fundamental understanding and its applications. By changing growth parameters,
we achieved a variety of surface terminations in V$_2$O$_3$ films that are
characterized by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and photoemission
spectroscopy techniques. Depending upon the terminations, our results show MIT
can be partially or fully suppressed near the surface region due to the
different filling of the electrons at the surface and sub-surface layers and
change of screening length compared to the bulk. Across MIT, a strong
redistribution of spectral weight and its transfer from high-to-low binding
energy regime is observed in a wide-energy-scale. Our results show total
spectral weight in the low-energy regime is not conserved across MIT,
indicating a breakdown of `sum rules of spectral weight', a signature of a
strongly correlated system. Such change in spectral weight is possibly linked
to the change in hybridization, lattice volume ({\it i.e.,} effective carrier
density), and spin degree of freedom in the system that happens across MIT. We
find that MIT in this system is strongly correlation-driven where the
electron-electron interactions play a pivotal role. Moreover, our results
provide a better insight in understanding the electronic structure of strongly
correlated systems and highlight the importance of accounting surface effects
during interpretation of the physical property data mainly using surface
sensitive probes, such as surface resistivity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08555v1

Few-Shot Domain Adaptation For End-to-End Communication,2021-08-02T13:18:40Z,"Jayaram Raghuram, Yijing Zeng, Dolores GarcÃ­a MartÃ­, Rafael Ruiz Ortiz, Somesh Jha, Joerg Widmer, Suman Banerjee","The problem of end-to-end learning of a communication system using an
autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using
neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A
challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that
under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent
retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate.
Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples,
it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We
propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot)
domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks.
Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised
domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source
distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution
using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a
generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN),
and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a
set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used
to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the
distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the
source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common
to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.

Public procurement, where public resources are used to purchase goods or

practices. However, government turnover may bring significant changes in the
way public contracting is done, and thus, in the levels and types of corruption
involved in public procurement. In this respect, M\'exico lived a historical

determine whether these changes affect how corruption takes place. To do this,
we propose a statistical framework to compare the characteristics of the
contracting practices within each administration, separating the contracts in
different classes depending on whether or not they were made with companies
that have now been identified as being involved in corrupt practices. We find
that while the amount of resources spent with companies that turned out to be

reaching Lorentz factors as high as $\Gamma>50$. How the jets accelerate to
such high velocities and where along the jet do they reach terminal velocity
are open questions that are tightly linked to their structure, launching and
dissipation mechanisms. Changes in the beaming factor along the jets could
potentially reveal jet acceleration, deceleration, or bending. We aim to (1)
quantify the relativistic effects in multiple radio frequencies and (2) study
possible jet velocity--viewing angle variations at parsec scales. We used the
state-of-the-art code Magnetron to model light curves from the University of
Michigan Radio Observatory and the Mets\""{a}hovi Radio Observatory's monitoring
programs in five frequencies covering about 25 years of observations in the
4.8-37~GHz range for 61 sources. We supplement our data set with high-frequency
radio observations in the 100-340~GHz range from ALMA, CARMA, and SMA. For each
frequency we estimate the Doppler factor which we use to quantify possible
changes in the relativistic effects along the jets. The majority of our sources
do not show any statistically significant difference in their Doppler factor
across frequencies. This is consistent with constant velocity in a conical jet,
as expected at parsec scales. However, our analysis reveals 17 sources where
relativistic beaming changes as a function of frequency. In the majority of
cases the Doppler factor increases towards lower frequencies. Only 1253-053
shows the opposite behavior. By exploring their jet properties we find that the
jet of 0420-014 is likely bent across the 4.8-340~GHz range. For 0212+735 the

"Inverse energy cascade in self-gravitating collisionless dark matter
  flow and effects of halo shape",2021-10-26T17:41:38Z,"Zhijie, Xu","Halo-mediated mass and energy cascades are key to understand dark matter
flow. Both cascades origin from the mass exchange between halo and out-of-halo
sub-systems. Kinetic energy can be from the motion of halos and particle motion
in halos. Similarly, potential energy can be due to the inter- and intra-halo
interactions. Intra-halo virial equilibrium is established much faster than
inter-halo. Change of energy of entire system comes from virilization in halos.
At statistically steady state, continuous mass exchange is required to sustain
growth of total halo mass $M_h\propto a^{1/2}$ and energy $E\propto a^{3/2}$,
where $a$ is scale factor. Inverse cascade is identified for kinetic energy
that is transferred from the smallest scale to large mass scales. This is
sustained by the direct cascade of potential energy from large to small scale.
Both energies have a scale- and time-independent flux in propagation range that
is proportional to mass flux. Energy cascade is mostly facilitated by mass
cascade, which can be quantitatively described by mass accretion of typical
halos. Halo radial, angular momentum, and angular velocity are modelled and
inverse cascade is identified for the coherent radial and rotational motion in
halos. In turbulence, vortex stretching (shape changing) along its axis of spin
enables energy cascade from large to small length scales. However, change in
halo shape is not the dominant mechanism for energy cascade as the moment of
inertial gained from shape changing is less than 2 times. Large halos exhibit
preference for prolateness over oblateness and most halos have spin axis
perpendicular to major axis. Since mass cascade is local in mass space, halo
shape evolves continuously in mass space with halos formed by incrementally
inheriting structure from progenitor halos. A unique evolution path of halos is
found that gradually approaches sphere with increasing size.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13885v2

connection with the morphology of the galaxy. This is done by examining the
distribution of parametric and non-parametric statistics across the
star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) plane and studying how
these distributions change with the environment in the local universe
($z<0.15$).
  We determine the concentration (C), Gini, M$_{20}$, asymmetry, Gini-M$_{20}$
bulge statistic (GMB), 50\% light radius ($r_{50}$), total S\'{e}rsic index,
and bulge S\'{e}rsic index ($n_{Bulge}$) for galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass
Assembly (GAMA) survey using optical images from the Kilo Degree Survey. We
determine the galaxy environment using the GAMA group catalogue and split the
galaxies into field or group galaxies. The group galaxies are further divided
by the group halo mass (M$_{h}$) -
$11\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<12$,
$12\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<13$, and
$13\leq\mathrm{log(M}_{h}/\mathrm{M}_\odot)<14$ - and into central and
satellite galaxies. The galaxies in each of these samples are then placed onto
the SFR-M$_{\star}$ plane, and each parameter is used as a third dimension. We
fit the resulting distributions for each parameter in each sample using two
two-dimensional Gaussian distributions: one for star-forming galaxies and one
for quiescent galaxies. The coefficients of these Gaussian fits are then
compared between environments.
  Using C and $r_{50}$, we find that galaxies typically become larger as the
group mass increases. This change is greater for larger galaxies. There is no
indication that galaxies are typically more or less clumpy as the environment
changes. Using GMB and $n_{Bulge}$, we see that the star-forming galaxies do
not become more bulge or disk dominated as the group mass changes. Asymmetry

Multi-Wavelength Photometry Derived from Monochromatic Kepler Data,2021-01-29T20:09:29Z,"Christina Hedges, Rodrigo Luger, Jessie Dotson, Daniel Foreman-Mackey, Geert Barentsen","The Kepler mission has provided a wealth of data, revealing new insights in
time-domain astronomy. However, Kepler's single band-pass has limited studies
to a single wavelength. In this work we build a data-driven, pixel-level model
for the Pixel Response Function (PRF) of Kepler targets, modeling the image
data from the spacecraft. Our model is sufficiently flexible to capture known
detector effects, such as non-linearity, intra-pixel sensitivity variations,
and focus change. In theory, the shape of the Kepler PRF should also be weakly
wavelength dependent, due to optical chromatic aberration and wavelength
dependent detector response functions. We are able to identify these predicted
shape changes to the PRF using the residuals between Kepler data and our model.
In this work, we show that these PRF changes correspond to wavelength
variability in Kepler targets using a small sample of eclipsing binaries. Using
our model, we demonstrate that pixel-level light curves of eclipsing binaries
show variable eclipse depths, ellipsoidal modulation and limb darkening. These
changes at the pixel level are consistent with multi-wavelength photometry. Our
work suggests each pixel in the Kepler data of a single target has a different
effective wavelength, ranging from $\approx$ 550-750 $nm$. In this proof of
concept, we demonstrate our model, and discuss possible use cases for the
wavelength dependent Pixel Response Function of Kepler. These use cases include

"ALMA/NICER observations of GRS 1915+105 indicate a return to a hard
  state",2021-02-01T08:25:52Z,"Karri I. I. Koljonen, Talvikki Hovatta","GRS 1915+105 is a transient black hole X-ray binary consistently emitting
10-100% of the Eddington luminosity in the X-ray band during the last three
decades until mid-2018 when the source luminosity suddenly decreased by an
order of magnitude. This phase was followed by a change to a state with even
lower average X-ray fluxes never seen before during the outburst but presenting
renewed flaring activity at different wavelengths. Nevertheless, the mean
fluxes were still in decline. GRS 1915+105 has the longest orbital period known
among low-mass X-ray binaries, the largest accretion disk size, and therefore
the largest mass supply for accretion. The high inclination of the disk allows
the study of geometrical effects of the accretion flow such as changes in the
height-to-radius ratio or the effect of accretion disk winds on the intrinsic
emission that are expected during the outburst decay. In addition, the
transient jet is expected to change to a compact, self-absorbed, steady jet. We
conducted two full polarization Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations to
study the jet properties during the outburst decay by analyzing the spectral,
polarization, and intra-epoch variability for both observation epochs. In
addition, we analyzed nearly daily Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer
pointing observations consisting of modeling X-ray power spectral densities,
spectral energy distributions, and lightcurves with a physically motivated
model to follow the changing accretion disk properties throughout the outburst
decay and relating them to the jet emission. We show that the X-ray and mm
spectral, timing, and polarization properties are consistent with those of a
typical decaying X-ray binary outburst and that GRS 1915+105 has descended into
the low-luminosity hard X-ray state.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00693v2

attenuation correction (AC) in the image domain for the myocardial perfusion
SPECT imaging (MPI-SPECT) using two residual (ResNet) and UNet deep
convolutional neural networks. Methods: The MPI-SPECT 99mTc-sestamibi images of
99 participants were retrospectively examined. UNet and ResNet networks were
trained using SPECT non-attenuation corrected images as input and CT-based
attenuation corrected SPECT images (CT-AC) as reference. The Chang AC approach,
considering a uniform attenuation coefficient within the body contour, was also
implemented. Quantitative and clinical evaluation of the proposed methods were
performed considering SPECT CT-AC images of 19 subjects as reference using the
mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM) metrics, as well
as relevant clinical indices such as perfusion deficit (TPD). Results: Overall,
the deep learning solution exhibited good agreement with the CT-based AC,
noticeably outperforming the Chang method. The ResNet and UNet models resulted
in the ME (count) of ${-6.99\pm16.72}$ and ${-4.41\pm11.8}$ and SSIM of
${0.99\pm0.04}$ and ${0.98\pm0.05}$, respectively. While the Change approach
led to ME and SSIM of ${25.52\pm33.98}$ and ${0.93\pm0.09}$, respectively.
Similarly, the clinical evaluation revealed a mean TPD of ${12.78\pm9.22}$ and
${12.57\pm8.93}$ for the ResNet and UNet models, respectively, compared to
${12.84\pm8.63}$ obtained from the reference SPECT CT-AC images. On the other
hand, the Chang approach led to a mean TPD of ${16.68\pm11.24}$. Conclusion: We
evaluated two deep convolutional neural networks to estimate SPECT-AC images
directly from the non-attenuation corrected images. The deep learning solutions
exhibited the promising potential to generate reliable attenuation corrected
SPECT images without the use of transmission scanning.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04915v2
"Interfacial metric mechanics: stitching patterns of shape change in
  active sheets",2021-02-09T17:10:58Z,"Fan Feng, Daniel Duffy, Mark Warner, John S. Biggins","A flat sheet programmed with a planar pattern of spontaneous shape change
will morph into a curved surface. Such metric mechanics is seen in growing
biological sheets, and may be engineered in actuating soft matter sheets such
as phase-changing liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), swelling gels and inflating
baromorphs. Here, we show how to combine multiple patterns in a sheet by
stitching regions of different shape changes together piecewise along
interfaces. This approach allows simple patterns to be used as building blocks,
and enables the design of multi-material or active/passive sheets. We give a
general condition for an interface to be geometrically compatible, and explore
its consequences for LCE/LCE, gel/gel, and active/passive interfaces. In
contraction/elongation systems such as LCEs, we find an infinite set of
compatible interfaces between any pair of patterns along which the metric is
discontinuous, and a finite number across which the metric is continuous. As an
example, we find all possible interfaces between pairs of LCE logarithmic
spiral patterns. In contrast, in isotropic systems such as swelling gels, only
a finite number of continuous interfaces are available, greatly limiting the
potential of stitching. In both continuous and discontinuous cases, we find the
stitched interfaces generically carry singular Gaussian curvature, leading to
intrinsically curved folds in the actuated surface. We give a general
expression for the distribution of this curvature, and a more specialized form
for interfaces in LCE patterns. The interfaces thus also have rich geometric
and mechanical properties in their own right.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04955v5

Potential benefits of delaying the second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose,2021-02-26T17:16:18Z,"Benjamin F. Maier, Angelique Burdinski, Annika H. Rose, Frank Schlosser, David Hinrichs, Cornelia Betsch, Lars Korn, Philipp Sprengholz, Michael Meyer-Hermann, Tanmay Mitra, Karl Lauterbach, Dirk Brockmann","Vaccination against COVID-19 with the recently approved mRNA vaccines
BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in a
large number of countries. However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading
SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits
in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine,
for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution
to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy,
the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity,
reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A
quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard
vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide
a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic
epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a
risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation
and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the
second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit
range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public
health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial
protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the
first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine
compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on
vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that,
in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in
vaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy
change to remain substantial and stable.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13600v1

wall and its reaction to pressure variations, we implemented successive
ultrasonic experiments on the exterior surface of the containment wall in the
gusset area for three consecutive years. During each experiment, the pressure
inside the containment wall increased gradually from 0 MPa to 0.43 MPa and then
decreased back to 0 Mpa.From the analysis of the ultrasonic coda waves obtained
in the multiple scattering regime, we performed Coda Wave Interferometry to
calculate the apparent velocity changes in the structure (denoted by $dV/V_a$)
and Coda Wave Decorrelation (DC) measurements to produce 3D cartographies of
stress and crack distribution. From three source-receiver pairs, located at the
top, middle and bottom of the experimental region, we observe that coda waves
dilate, shrink and remain almost unchanged, respectively. This corresponds to
the decreasing, increasing and invariant pressure inside the concrete. The
comparison of three years' results demonstrates that the variation of $dV/V_a$
and DC under the same pressure test increases through the years, which
indicates the progressive deterioration and aging of the concrete. From a large
collection of source-receiver pairs at different times, the spatial-temporal
variations of $dV/V_a$ and DC are then used to produce a map of the structural
velocity and scattering changes, respectively. We observe a decreasing velocity
on the top part and an increasing in the middle one, which is in line with the
$dV/V_a$ analysis. The reconstructed scattering changes (or structural changes)
highlight the active region during the inflation-deflation procedure,
corresponding to the opening and closing (and sometimes the development) of
cracks. The larger magnitude in 2019 than in 2017 indicates the increasing
damage in the concrete.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01342v1

adapt to human partners, who typically exhibit an immense diversity of
behaviors. We present an autonomous framework as a cobot's real-time
decision-making mechanism to anticipate a variety of human characteristics and
behaviors, including human errors, toward a personalized collaboration. Our
framework handles such behaviors in two levels: 1) short-term human behaviors
are adapted through our novel Anticipatory Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (A-POMDP) models, covering a human's changing intent (motivation),
availability, and capability; 2) long-term changing human characteristics are
adapted by our novel Adaptive Bayesian Policy Selection (ABPS) mechanism that
selects a short-term decision model, e.g., an A-POMDP, according to an estimate
of a human's workplace characteristics, such as her expertise and collaboration
preferences. To design and evaluate our framework over a diversity of human
behaviors, we propose a pipeline where we first train and rigorously test the
framework in simulation over novel human models. Then, we deploy and evaluate
it on our novel physical experiment setup that induces cognitive load on humans
to observe their dynamic behaviors, including their mistakes, and their
changing characteristics such as their expertise. We conduct user studies and
show that our framework effectively collaborates non-stop for hours and adapts
to various changing human behaviors and characteristics in real-time. That
increases the efficiency and naturalness of the collaboration with a higher

magnetic anisotropy to the switching of the orbital magnetic moment, using
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism analysis. We also inferred that different
c-lattice constants might be responsible for the magnetic anisotropy change,

2007-2009 and near minimum 24_25 with positive polarity in 2017-2018 using data

calculate the radial and tangential components of the anisotropy of GCRs for
different sectors (plus corresponds to the positive and minus to the negative

used for characterizing the GCRs modulation in the heliosphere. We show that in
the solar minimum 23_24 in 2007-2009 when negative, the drift effect is not
visibly evident in the changes of the radial component, i.e. the drift effect
is found to produce 4 % change in the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy

acceptable in 2007-2009. In turn, near the solar minimum 24_25 in 2017-2018

the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy for 2017-2018. So in the period of

results of this work are in good agreement with the drift theory of GCRs

drift stream of GCRs is directed toward (away from) the Sun, thus giving rise

using the dynamic heights and the gravitational slopes calculated from the
Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the studied area using the ArcGIS software

to detect and quantify the temporal changes that occurred in two depressions of
the Ash region during the last perihelion passage. We find that the two
depressions grew by several meters. The area of the smallest depression
(structure I) increased by 90+/-20%, with two preferential growths: one close
to the cliff associated with the apparition of new boulders at its foot, and a
second one on the opposite side of the cliff. The largest depression (structure
II) grew in all directions, increasing in area by 20+/-5%, and no new deposits
have been detected. We interpreted these two depression changes as being driven
by the sublimation of ices, which explains their global growth and which can
also trigger landslides. The deposits associated with depression II reveal a
stair-like topography, indicating that they have accumulated during several
successive landslides from different perihelion passages. Overall, these

galaxy MCG--02--58--22 to ascertain the nature of the X-ray reprocessing media,
using observations from Suzaku (2009) and simultaneous observations from
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (2016) . The most significant results of our
investigation are: 1. The primary X-ray emission from the corona is constant in
these observations, both in terms of the power law slope ($\Gamma=1.80$) and
luminosity ($L_{2-10 \rm keV}= 2.55\times 10^{44} $ erg/s). 2. The soft excess
flux decreased by a factor of two in 2016, the Compton hump weakened/vanished
in 2016, and the narrow FeK$\alpha$ emission line became marginally broad
($\sigma=0.35\pm0.08$ keV) and its flux doubled in 2016. 3. From physical model
fits we find that the normalization of the narrow component of the FeK$\alpha$
line does not change in the two epochs, although the Compton hump vanishes in
the same time span. Since the primary X-ray continuum does not change, we
presume that any changes in the reprocessed emission must arise due to changes
in the reprocessing media. Our primary conclusions are: A. The vanishing of the
Compton hump in 2016 can probably be explained by a dynamic clumpy torus which
is infalling/outflowing, or by a polar torus wind. B. The torus in this AGN
possibly has two structures: an equatorial toroidal disk (producing the narrow
FeK$\alpha$ emission) and a polar component (producing the variable Compton
hump), C. The reduction of the soft-excess flux by half and increase in the
FeK$\alpha$ flux by a factor of two in the same period cannot be adequately
explained by ionized disk reflection model alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14627v1

temperatures expected to drive high ionizing photon production rates. In this
work, we take our Geneva stellar evolution models of zero-metallicity stars and
predict their production rates of photons capable to ionize H, He I and He II,
based on a blackbody approximation. We present analytical fits in the range
1.7-500 solar masses. We then explore the impact of stellar initial mass,
rotation, and convective overshooting for individual stars. We have found that
ionizing photon production rates increase with increasing initial mass. For the
rotational velocities considered we see changes of up to 25% to ionizing
photons produced. This varies with initial mass and ionizing photon species and
reflects changes to surface properties due to rotation. We have also found that
higher convective overshooting increases ionizing photon production by
approximately 20% for the change in overshooting considered here. For stellar
populations, we explore how the production of ionizing photons varies as a
function of the initial mass function (IMF) slope, and minimum and maximum
initial masses. For a fixed population mass we have found changes of the order
of 20-30% through varying the nature of the IMF. This work presents ionizing

  Online High-Confidence Change-Point Detection",2021-05-20T01:57:52Z,"Lucas N. Alegre, Ana L. C. Bazzan, Bruno C. da Silva","Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning
algorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on
latent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that
maximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.
We call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions
such as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of
pre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or
boundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns
policies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream
of data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection
statistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created
and deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones
might be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until
unforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid
responses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in
order to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a
(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model
the different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We
evaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning
problems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and

analysis of this pulsar shows a disturbance accompanying this profile change

"Design and Fabrication of a Microfluidic System with Nozzle/Diffuser
  Micropump and Viscosity",2021-07-17T17:07:37Z,Sumana Bhattacharjee,"Micropumps are one of the most important parts of a microfluidic system. In
particular, for biomedical applications such as Lab-on-Chip systems, micropumps
are used to transport and manipulate test fluids in a controlled manner. In
this work, a low-cost, structurally simple, piezoelectrically actuated
micropump was simulated and fabricated using poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The
channels in PDMS were fabricated using patterned SU-8 structures. The pump flow
rate was measured to be 9.49 uL/min, 14.06 uL/min, 20.87 uL/min for applied
voltages of 12 V, 14 V, 16 V respectively. Further, we report finite element
analysis (FEA) simulation to confirm the operation of the micropump and compare
favorably the experimentally obtained flowrate with the one predicted by
simulation. By taking these flow rates as a reference, the chamber pressure was
found to be 1.1 to 1.5 kPa from FEA simulations.
  Viscosity measurement has wide-ranging applications from the oil industry to
the pharmaceutical industry. This work provides an elaborate mathematical model
and study of measurement of viscosity in real-time using pressure sensors. For
a given flowrate, a change in liquid viscosity gives rise to a change in
pressure difference across a particular section of the pipe. Hence, by
recording the pressure change, viscosity can be calculated dynamically.
Mathematical modeling as well as finite element analysis (FEA) modeling has
been presented. A set of pressure sensors were placed at a fixed distance from
each other to get the real-time pressure change. Knowing the flow rate in the
channel, the viscosity has been calculated from the pressure difference. For
the finite element analysis, the pressure sensors were placed 60 mm away from
each other. A different ratio of the mixture of water and glycerol was used to
provide variable viscosity, which led to the variation in pressure-difference
values.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08284v1

Changes in Seasonal Upper Tropical Momentum Fluxes with Global Warming,2021-07-20T17:32:45Z,"Abu Bakar Siddiqui Thakur, Jai Sukhatme","The boreal summer tropical upper-tropospheric momentum budget involves a
balance between eddy and mean meridional fluxes. In winter, however, the eddy
flux itself acts to accelerate and decelerate the zonal flow in the Asian and
East Pacific regions, respectively. In a zonal mean sense, the residual of
these two is then balanced by the mean meridional flux. These features are
qualitatively captured by the CMIP6 suite of models in their control runs. With
warming, the CMIP6 ensemble shows that the flux budget changes in a
quantitative manner, in both the summer and winter seasons. Apart from the mean
meridional flux which is affected by the projected weakening of the Hadley
Cells, there are significant changes in eddy fluxes too. Notably, stationary
wave fluxes are affected in the Asian and East Pacific regions during the
summer and winter seasons, respectively. In the wintertime, extratropical wave
activity penetrating into the East Pacific almost shuts off due to a weakening
of the prevalent westerlies in the warming simulations. Whereas, in summer,
eddy fluxes in the Asian region are displaced upward and changes are observed
in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Specifically, rotational flow
around the Asian summer anticyclone weakens in the upper troposphere while
strengthening in the lower stratosphere. Concomitantly, eddy flux convergence
over the equatorial Indian Ocean decreases in the former and increases (by a
larger amount) in the latter. In fact, strengthening of summertime tropical and
subtropical stationary waves in the lower stratosphere with warming is not
restricted to the Asian sector but is observed over all longitudes.
Effectively, the magnitude of all terms in the upper tropospheric momentum flux
budget decreases with warming, and an ensemble mean continues to yield a
marginally westward annual and zonal mean equatorial zonal flow.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09646v1

  Legacy Fonts and Creating a Parallel Corpus for Tamil-Sinhala-English",2021-09-13T13:26:30Z,"Charangan Vasantharajan, Laksika Tharmalingam, Uthayasanker Thayasivam","Most low-resource languages do not have the necessary resources to create
even a substantial monolingual corpus. These languages may often be found in
government proceedings but mainly in Portable Document Format (PDF) that
contains legacy fonts. Extracting text from these documents to create a
monolingual corpus is challenging due to legacy font usage and printer-friendly
encoding, which are not optimized for text extraction. Therefore, we propose a
simple, automatic, and novel idea that can scale for Tamil, Sinhala, English

Sinhala are Low-Resource Languages, we improved the performance of Tesseract by
employing LSTM-based training on more than 20 legacy fonts to recognize printed
characters in these languages. Especially, our model detects code-mixed text,
numbers, and special characters from the printed document. It is shown that
this approach can reduce the character-level error rate of Tesseract from 6.03

Automatically detecting data drift in machine learning classifiers,2021-11-10T12:34:14Z,"Samuel Ackerman, Orna Raz, Marcel Zalmanovici, Aviad Zlotnick","Classifiers and other statistics-based machine learning (ML) techniques
generalize, or learn, based on various statistical properties of the training
data. The assumption underlying statistical ML resulting in theoretical or
empirical performance guarantees is that the distribution of the training data
is representative of the production data distribution. This assumption often
breaks; for instance, statistical distributions of the data may change. We term
changes that affect ML performance `data drift' or `drift'.
  Many classification techniques compute a measure of confidence in their
results. This measure might not reflect the actual ML performance. A famous
example is the Panda picture that is correctly classified as such with a
confidence of about 60\%, but when noise is added it is incorrectly classified
as a Gibbon with a confidence of above 99\%. However, the work we report on
here suggests that a classifier's measure of confidence can be used for the
purpose of detecting data drift.
  We propose an approach based solely on classifier suggested labels and its
confidence in them, for alerting on data distribution or feature space changes
that are likely to cause data drift. Our approach identities degradation in
model performance and does not require labeling of data in production which is
often lacking or delayed. Our experiments with three different data sets and
classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting data
drift. This is especially encouraging as the classification itself may or may
not be correct and no model input data is required. We further explore the
statistical approach of sequential change-point tests to automatically
determine the amount of data needed in order to identify drift while
controlling the false positive rate (Type-1 error).",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05672v1

  excitation energy of fissioning systems",2021-11-16T07:56:52Z,"Kazuya Shimada, Chikako Ishizuka, Fedir A. Ivanyuk, Satoshi Chiba","We elucidated the reason why the average total kinetic energy (TKE) of
fission fragments decreases when the excitation energy of the fissioning
systems increases as indicated by experimental data for the neutron-induced
fission events. To explore this problem, we used a method based on the
four-dimensional Langevin equations we have developed. We have calculated the
TKE of fission fragments for fissioning systems $^{236}$U$^{*}$ and
$^{240}$Pu$^{*}$ excited above respective fission barriers, and compared the
results with experimental data for n + $^{235}$U and n + $^{239}$Pu reactions,
respectively. From the Langevin-model analysis, we have found that the shape of
the abundant heavy fragments changes from almost spherical for low excitation
domain to highly prolate shape for high excitation energy, while that of the
light fragments does not change noticeably. The change of the ""shape"" of the
heavy fragments causes an increase of a distance between the charge centers of
the nascent fragments just after scission as excitation energy increases.
Accordingly, the Coulomb repulsion between the two fragments decreases with an
increase of the excitation energy, which causes the decrease of the average
TKE. In this manner, we found that the change of the shape of the heavy
fragment as a function of the excitation energy is the key issue for the TKE of
fission fragments to decrease as the excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei
increases. In other words, washing out of the shell effects which affect the
shape of the heavy fragments is the key reason for the decreasing energy
dependence of the average TKE of the fission fragments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08278v1

"The Pantheon+ Analysis: SuperCal-Fragilistic Cross Calibration,
  Retrained SALT2 Light Curve Model, and Calibration Systematic Uncertainty",2021-12-07T17:57:24Z,"Dillon Brout, Georgie Taylor, Dan Scolnic, Charlotte M. Wood, Benjamin M. Rose, Maria Vincenzi, Arianna Dwomoh, Christopher Lidman, Adam Riess, Noor Ali, Helen Qu, Mi Dai","We present here a re-calibration of the photometric systems used in the
Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those used for the
SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of H$_0$. We utilize the large and uniform
sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog to
cross-calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia
surveys. The most significant updates over the `SuperCal' cross-calibration
used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses are: 1) expansion of the
number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), 2) solving for
all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously in order to produce a
calibration uncertainty covariance matrix that can be used in
cosmological-model constraints, and 3) accounting for the change in the
fundamental flux calibration of the HST CALSPEC standards from previous
versions on the order of $1.5\%$ over a $\Delta \lambda$ of 4000~\AA. The
re-calibration of samples used for light-curve fitting has historically been
decoupled from the retraining of the light-curve model. Here, we are able to
retrain the SALT2 model using this new calibration and find the change in the
model coupled with the change to the calibration of the light-curves themselves
causes a net distance modulus change ($d\mu/dz$) of 0.04 mag over the redshift
range $0<z<1$. We introduce a new formalism to determine the systematic impact
on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in fitted calibration
offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find a
total calibration uncertainty impact of $\sigma_w=0.013$, which is roughly half
the size of the sample statistical uncertainty. Similarly, we find a systematic
SN calibration contribution to the SH0ES H$_0$ uncertainty is less than
0.2~km/s/Mpc, suggesting that SN Ia calibration cannot resolve the current
level of the `Hubble Tension'.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03864v2

Plasma dynamics in the flaring loop observed by RHESSI,2021-12-21T17:52:23Z,"T. Mrozek, R. Falewicz, S. Kolomanski, M. Litwicka","The thick-target model predicts that in flare foot points, we should observe
lowering of HXR sources' altitude with increasing energy. The foot point of HXR
sources result from the direct interaction of non-thermal electron beams with
plasma in the lower part of the solar atmosphere, where the density increases
rapidly. Therefore, we can estimate the plasma density distribution along the
non-thermal electron beam directly from the observations of the altitude-energy
relation obtained for the HXR foot point sources. The relation's shape is
density-dependent and is also determined by the power-law distribution of
non-thermal electrons. Additionally, during the impulsive phase these
parameters may change dramatically. Thus, the interpretation of observed HXR
foot point sources' altitudes is not straightforward and needs detailed
numerical modelling of the electron precipitation process. The numerical model
was calculated using the hydrodynamic 1D model with an application of the
Fokker-Planck formalism for non-thermal beam precipitation. HXR data from
RHESSI were used to trace chromospheric density changes during a non-thermal
emission burst, in detail. We have found that the amount of mass that
evaporated from the chromosphere is in good agreement with the ranges obtained
from hydrodynamical modelling of a flaring loop, and from an analysis of
observed emission measure in the loop top, and with specific scaling laws.
Consistency between the obtained values shows that HXR images may provide an
important constraint for models - a mass of plasma that evaporated due to a
non-thermal electron beam depositing energy in the chromosphere. High-energy,
non-thermal sources' (above 20 keV in this case) positions fit the column
density changes obtained from the hydrodynamical model perfectly. Density
changes seem to be less affected by the electrons' spectral index.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11392v1

How do exponential size solutions arise in semidefinite programming?,2021-02-26T20:32:10Z,"GÃ¡bor Pataki, Aleksandr Touzov","A striking pathology of semidefinite programs (SDPs) is illustrated by a
classical example of Khachiyan: feasible solutions in SDPs may need exponential

to solve a long standing, fundamental open problem: can we decide feasibility
of SDPs in polynomial time?
  The consensus seems that SDPs with large size solutions are rare. However,
here we prove that they are actually quite common: a linear change of variables
transforms every strictly feasible SDP into a Khachiyan type SDP, in which the
leading variables are large. As to ``how large"", that depends on the
singularity degree of a dual problem. Further, we present some SDPs coming from
sum-of-squares proofs, in which large solutions appear naturally, without any

the evolution of the non-cubic crystal-field splitting $\Delta$ measured by

of the tilt, rotation, and deformation of the IrBr$_6$ octahedra as well as
tetragonal strain on the electronic levels of Ir$^{4+}$. The N\'eel temperature

Mode Structure of a Broadband High Gain Parametric Amplifier,2021-03-06T11:17:53Z,"Xin Chen, Jacob Zhang, Z. Y. Ou","High gain parametric amplifier with a single-pass pulsed pump is known to
generate broadband twin photon fields that are entangled in amplitude and phase
but have complicated spectral correlation. Fortunately, they can be decomposed
into independent temporal modes. But the common treatment of parametric
interaction Hamiltonian does not consider the issue of time ordering problem of
interaction Hamiltonian and thus leads to incorrect conclusion that the mode
structure and the temporal mode functions do not change as the gain increases.
In this paper, we use an approach that is usually employed for treating
nonlinear interferometers and avoids the time ordering issue. This allows us to
derive an evolution equation in differential-integral form. Numerical solutions
for high gain situation indicate a gain-dependent mode structure that has its
mode distributions changed and mode functions broadened as the gain increases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04099v1

Behavior-Driven Synthesis of Human Dynamics,2021-03-08T11:36:32Z,"Andreas Blattmann, Timo Milbich, Michael Dorkenwald, BjÃ¶rn Ommer","Generating and representing human behavior are of major importance for
various computer vision applications. Commonly, human video synthesis
represents behavior as sequences of postures while directly predicting their
likely progressions or merely changing the appearance of the depicted persons,
thus not being able to exercise control over their actual behavior during the
synthesis process. In contrast, controlled behavior synthesis and transfer
across individuals requires a deep understanding of body dynamics and calls for
a representation of behavior that is independent of appearance and also of
specific postures. In this work, we present a model for human behavior
synthesis which learns a dedicated representation of human dynamics independent
of postures. Using this representation, we are able to change the behavior of a
person depicted in an arbitrary posture, or to even directly transfer behavior
observed in a given video sequence. To this end, we propose a conditional
variational framework which explicitly disentangles posture from behavior. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on this novel task, evaluating
capturing, transferring, and sampling fine-grained, diverse behavior, both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available at

observed at the 2010 and 2014 periastron passages in the near-infrared (NIR)

Ks-bands are almost identical in these periastron passages. A flare starts no
later than 10 days before periastron and the maximum brightening of about 0.1
magnitude is observed 12--17 days after periastron. The rising part of the
light curve is steeper and reaches a peak slightly earlier in the Ks-band than
in the other bands, thus a characteristic track appears on the NIR

that the variation in the Be circumstellar disk first occurs in an outer

expansion of the disk is evoked by the rapidly changing tidal torque around

which cancel the tadpole and represent a new configuration where the initial
D-brane system has adapted to the change in the closed string background. As an
example we consider the bulk deformation which changes the compactification

certain kind of twist data, reduces to a quotient by a discrete group. We
combine these two ideas by showing that variations of Hodge structure give rise
to the aforementioned kind of twist data and by then applying the twist
realisation of the c-map due to Macia and Swann. This extends previous results
regarding the lifting of general isomorphisms along the undeformed c-map, and
of infinitesimal automorphisms along the deformed c-map. We show in fact that

Fast and Efficient Bit-Level Precision Tuning,2021-03-09T06:12:41Z,"AssalÃ© AdjÃ©, Dorra Ben Khalifa, Matthieu Martel","In this article, we introduce a new technique for precision tuning. This
problem consists of finding the least data types for numerical values such that
the result of the computation satisfies some accuracy requirement. State of the
art techniques for precision tuning use a try and fail approach. They change
the data types of some variables of the program and evaluate the accuracy of
the result. Depending on what is obtained, they change more or less data types
and repeat the process. Our technique is radically different. Based on semantic
equations, we generate an Integer Linear Problem (ILP) from the program source
code. Basically, this is done by reasoning on the most significant bit and the
number of significant bits of the values which are integer quantities. The
integer solution to this problem, computed in polynomial time by a (real)
linear programming solver, gives the optimal data types at the bit level. A
finer set of semantic equations is also proposed which does not reduce directly
to an ILP problem. So we use policy iteration to find the solution. Both
techniques have been implemented and we show that our results encompass the

active fluids as the height of the container, $z$, changes. Along the varying
dimension, the geometry systematically increases, therefore, the confinement
($z$) transits from ""strong confinement"", to ""intermediate confinement"" and to
""weak confinement"" (close to ""unconfined""). In horizontal dimensions ($x,y$),
the system remains ""unconfined"". Through tracking the tracers dispersed in the
active fluids in three dimensions we observed that activity level,
characterized by velocity fluctuations of flow tracers, increases as system
size increases. Concomitantly, the velocity-velocity temporal correlation
changes from weak correlation to strong positive correlation, indicating
""memory"" in active flows. We estimate the characteristic size of the flow
structure by integrating the velocity-velocity spatial correlation function.
The integral increases as confinement becomes weaker and saturates at
approximately 400 microns as the system becomes ""unconfined"". This saturation

HMDs resilient against adversarial evasion attacks. Specifically, we propose to
leverage voltage overscaling to induce stochastic computation in the HMDs

black-box adversarial attack scenarios, i.e., reverse-engineering and
transferability. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stochastic-HMDs
offer effective defense against adversarial attacks along with by-product power
savings, without requiring any changes to the hardware/software nor to the

unified prior for entropy estimation and texture synthesis. Specifically, we
employ semantic segmentation maps as structural guidance for extracting deep

better detail construction and higher flexibility in subsequent high-level
vision tasks. Moreover, a cross-channel entropy model is proposed to further
exploit the inter-channel correlation of the spatially independent semantic

in optical transition energies, which are induced by the Moir\'e patterns. To
verify our model we performed resonant Raman scattering on purified and sorted
semiconducting DWCNTs. We find that the radial breathing mode shifts up to 14

Light confinement by local index tailoring in inhomogeneous dielectrics,2021-03-16T16:30:07Z,"I. KreÅ¡iÄ, K. G. Makris, S. Rotter","The engineering of light confinement is a topic with a long history in optics
and with significant implications for the control of light-matter interaction.
In inhomogeneous and disordered media, however, multiple scattering prevents
the application of conventional approaches for the design of light fields with
desired properties. This is because any local change to such a medium typically
affects these fields in a non-local and complicated fashion. Here, we present a
theoretical methodology for tailoring an inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D)
Hermitian dielectric index distribution, such that the intensity profile of an
incoming light field can be controlled purely locally, i.e., with little or no
influence on the field profile outside of a designated region of interest.
Strongly increasing or decreasing the light's intensity at arbitrary positions
inside the medium thereby becomes possible without, in fact, changing the
external reflectance or transmittance of the medium. These local modifications
of the medium can thus be made undetectable to unidirectional far field
measurements. We apply our approach to locally control the confinement of light

"IA Planner: Motion Planning Using Instantaneous Analysis for Autonomous
  Vehicle in the Dense Dynamic Scenarios on Highways",2021-03-19T17:10:50Z,"Xiaoyu Yang, Huiyun Li","In dense and dynamic scenarios, planning a safe and comfortable trajectory is
full of challenges when traffic participants are driving at high speed. The
classic graph search and sampling methods first perform path planning and then
configure the corresponding speed, which lacks a strategy to deal with the
high-speed obstacles. Decoupling optimization methods perform motion planning
in the S-L and S-T domains respectively. These methods require a large free
configuration space to plan the lane change trajectory. In dense dynamic
scenes, it is easy to cause the failure of trajectory planning and be cut in by
others, causing slow driving speed and bring safety hazards. We analyze the
collision relationship in the spatio-temporal domain, and propose an
instantaneous analysis model which only analyzes the collision relationship at
the same time. In the model, the collision-free constraints in 3D
spatio-temporal domain is projected to the 2D space domain to remove redundant
constraints and reduce computational complexity. Experimental results show that
our method can plan a safe and comfortable lane-changing trajectory in dense
dynamic scenarios. At the same time, it improves traffic efficiency and
increases ride comfort.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10909v1

"Most Efficient Sensor Network Protocol for a Permanent Natural Disaster
  Monitoring System",2021-03-20T04:53:02Z,"Changmin Lee, Seong-Lyun Kim","To minimize enormous havoc from disasters, permanent environment monitoring
is necessarily required. Thus we propose a novel energy management protocol for
energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs), named the adaptive sensor
node management protocol (ASMP). The proposed protocol makes system components
to systematically control their performance to conserve the energy. Through
this protocol, sensor nodes autonomously activate an additional energy
conservation algorithm. ASMP embeds three sampling algorithms. For the
optimized environment sampling, we proposed the adaptive sampling algorithm for
monitoring (ASA-m). ASA-m estimates the expected time period to occur
meaningful change. The meaningful change refers to the distance between two
target data for the monitoring QoS. Therefore, ASA-m merely gathers the data
the system demands. The continuous adaptive sampling algorithm (CASA) solves
the problem to be continuously decreasing energy despite of ASA-m. When the
monitored environment shows a linear trend property, the sensor node in CASA
rests a sampling process, and the server generates predicted data at the
estimated time slot. For guaranteeing the self-sustainability, ASMP uses the
recoverable adaptive sampling algorithm (RASA). RASA makes consumed energy
smaller than harvested energy by utilizing the predicted data. RASA recharges
the energy of the sensor node. Through this method, ASMP achieves both energy
conservation and service quality.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11098v1
Twisting or untwisting graphene twisted nanoribbons without rotation,2021-03-21T00:51:15Z,Alexandre F. Fonseca,"The common sense regarding twisting or untwisting a ribbon is that it
requires the application of an external rotation to happen. However, at
nanoscale, the application of precise amounts of rotation on a nanoribbon is
not a trivial task. Here, the concept of an alternative method to add twist to
or remove twist from a twisted graphene nanoribbon (TGNR) without rotation is
presented. The method consists of suspending a TGNR on two separate substrates
and by changing only their distance, the total amount of twist of the TGNR is
shown to change. The possibility to fine-tuning the amount of twist of a TGNR
is also shown. The concept is demonstrated through fully atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations and numerical calculations of the topological parameters
twist and writhe of a TGNR. It is shown that the above process satisfies the
so-called linking number theorem of space curves. Besides being experimentally
feasible, this concept reveals a new kind of twist to writhe transition
phenomenon that is tension-free and does not require controlling neither the
nanoribbon end-to-end distance nor its critical twist density.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11272v2
Online Convex Optimization with Continuous Switching Constraint,2021-03-21T11:43:35Z,"Guanghui Wang, Yuanyu Wan, Tianbao Yang, Lijun Zhang","In many sequential decision making applications, the change of decision would
bring an additional cost, such as the wear-and-tear cost associated with
changing server status. To control the switching cost, we introduce the problem
of online convex optimization with continuous switching constraint, where the
goal is to achieve a small regret given a budget on the \emph{overall}
switching cost. We first investigate the hardness of the problem, and provide a
lower bound of order $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ when the switching cost budget
$S=\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, and $\Omega(\min\{\frac{T}{S},T\})$ when $S=O(\sqrt{T})$,
where $T$ is the time horizon. The essential idea is to carefully design an
adaptive adversary, who can adjust the loss function according to the
cumulative switching cost of the player incurred so far based on the orthogonal
technique. We then develop a simple gradient-based algorithm which enjoys the
minimax optimal regret bound. Finally, we show that, for strongly convex
functions, the regret bound can be improved to $O(\log T)$ for $S=\Omega(\log
T)$, and $O(\min\{T/\exp(S)+S,T\})$ for $S=O(\log T)$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11370v1

humans to uncover relations among abstract concepts and further deduce implicit
rules from the relations. As a well-known abstract visual reasoning task,
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) are widely used in human IQ tests. Although
extensive research has been conducted on RPM solvers with machine intelligence,
few studies have considered further advancing the standard answer-selection
(classification) problem to a more challenging answer-painting (generating)
problem, which can verify whether the model has indeed understood the implicit
rules. In this paper we aim to solve the latter one by proposing a deep latent
variable model, in which multiple Gaussian processes are employed as priors of
latent variables to separately learn underlying abstract concepts from RPMs;
thus the proposed model is interpretable in terms of concept-specific latent
variables. The latent Gaussian process also provides an effective way of
extrapolation for answer painting based on the learned concept-changing rules.
We evaluate the proposed model on RPM-like datasets with multiple
continuously-changing visual concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that
our model requires only few training samples to paint high-quality answers,
generate novel RPM panels, and achieve interpretability through

intensity. The model exhibits three different bistability regimes: between
savanna and grassland; two savanna states; and savanna and woodland. The
impulsive model reveals rich bifurcation structures in response to changes in
fire intensity and frequency -- structures that are largely invisible to
analogous ODE models with continuous fire. In addition, by using the amount of

examine the resilience of the social value to different disturbance regimes. We

Dual-Parameterized Quantum Circuit GAN Model in High Energy Physics,2021-03-29T10:06:54Z,"Su Yeon Chang, Steven Herbert, Sofia Vallecorsa, ElÃ­as F. Combarro, Ross Duncan","Generative models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in particular,
are being studied as possible alternatives to Monte Carlo simulations. It has
been proposed that, in certain circumstances, simulation using GANs can be
sped-up by using quantum GANs (qGANs). We present a new design of qGAN, the
dual-Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) GAN, which consists of a classical
discriminator and two quantum generators which take the form of PQCs. The first
PQC learns a probability distribution over N-pixel images, while the second
generates normalized pixel intensities of an individual image for each PQC
input. With a view to HEP applications, we evaluated the dual-PQC architecture
on the task of imitating calorimeter outputs, translated into pixelated images.
The results demonstrate that the model can reproduce a fixed number of images
with a reduced size as well as their probability distribution and we anticipate
it should allow us to scale up to real calorimeter outputs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15470v1
Prototype-based Personalized Pruning,2021-03-25T05:49:42Z,"Jangho Kim, Simyung Chang, Sungrack Yun, Nojun Kwak","Nowadays, as edge devices such as smartphones become prevalent, there are
increasing demands for personalized services. However, traditional
personalization methods are not suitable for edge devices because retraining or
finetuning is needed with limited personal data. Also, a full model might be
too heavy for edge devices with limited resources. Unfortunately, model
compression methods which can handle the model complexity issue also require
the retraining phase. These multiple training phases generally need huge
computational cost during on-device learning which can be a burden to edge
devices. In this work, we propose a dynamic personalization method called
prototype-based personalized pruning (PPP). PPP considers both ends of
personalization and model efficiency. After training a network, PPP can easily
prune the network with a prototype representing the characteristics of personal
data and it performs well without retraining or finetuning. We verify the
usefulness of PPP on a couple of tasks in computer vision and Keyword spotting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15564v1

particularly in the grafted molecule. We find out that the energetically most
stable configuration of the V-Pc/Au(111) occurs when V-Pc is grafted to the Au

Self-Constructing Neural Networks Through Random Mutation,2021-03-29T15:27:38Z,Samuel Schmidgall,"The search for neural architecture is producing many of the most exciting
results in artificial intelligence. It has increasingly become apparent that
task-specific neural architecture plays a crucial role for effectively solving
problems. This paper presents a simple method for learning neural architecture
through random mutation. This method demonstrates 1) neural architecture may be
learned during the agent's lifetime, 2) neural architecture may be constructed
over a single lifetime without any initial connections or neurons, and 3)
architectural modifications enable rapid adaptation to dynamic and novel task
scenarios. Starting without any neurons or connections, this method constructs
a neural architecture capable of high-performance on several tasks. The

Classicality of the heat produced by quantum measurements,2021-03-29T16:43:43Z,M. Hamed Mohammady,"Quantum measurement is ultimately a physical process, resulting from an
interaction between the measured system and a measuring apparatus. Considering
the physical process of measurement within a thermodynamic context naturally
raises the following question: How can the work and heat be interpreted? In the
present paper we model the measurement process for an arbitrary discrete
observable as a measurement scheme. Here the system to be measured is first
unitarily coupled with an apparatus and subsequently the compound system is
objectified with respect to a pointer observable, thus producing definite
measurement outcomes. The work can therefore be interpreted as the change in
internal energy of the compound system due to the unitary coupling. By the
first law of thermodynamics, the heat is the subsequent change in internal
energy of this compound due to pointer objectification. We argue that the
apparatus serves as a stable record for the measurement outcomes only if the
pointer observable commutes with the Hamiltonian and show that such
commutativity implies that the uncertainty of heat will necessarily be

  Unactuated Hinges",2021-03-30T19:18:02Z,"Nathan Bucki, Jerry Tang, Mark W. Mueller","A novel quadcopter capable of changing shape mid-flight is presented,
allowing for operation in four configurations with the capability of sustained
hover in three. This is accomplished without requiring actuators beyond the
four motors typical of a quadcopter. Morphing is achieved through
freely-rotating hinges that allow the vehicle arms to fold downwards by either
reducing or reversing thrust forces. Constraints placed on the control inputs
of the vehicle prevent the arms from folding or unfolding unexpectedly. This
allows for the use of existing quadcopter controllers and trajectory generation
algorithms with only minimal added complexity. For our experimental vehicle at
hover, we find that these constraints result in a 36% reduction of the maximum
yaw torque the vehicle can produce, but do not result in a reduction of the
maximum thrust or roll and pitch torques. Experimental results show that, for a
typical maneuver, the added limits have a negligible effect on trajectory
tracking performance. Finally, the ability to change configurations is shown to
enable the vehicle to traverse small passages, perch on hanging wires, and

consequences for example for the temperature dependence of local transport
properties. We demonstrate that as a consequences of this current carrying
filaments on the nano-scale the magnetotransport properties of the interface
are highly anisotropic. Our magnetoresistance measurements reveal that the
magnetoresistance in different nanostructures ($<500nm$) is random in magnitude
and sign, respectively. Warming up nanostructures above the structural phase
transition temperature (105K) results in the significant change in MR. Even a
sign change of the magnetoresistance is possible. The results suggest that
domain walls that are differently oriented with respect to the surface exhibit

exploring the relationship between human rationality and Bayesian theory, we
demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in describing how opinions evolve.
Our analysis leverages the Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA)

as confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and our reluctance to change
opinions. Through this, we obtain update rules that offer deeper insights into
the dynamics of extreme opinions. Our work sheds light on the role of human

One is to create a temporal network from real data and check the change in
travel time according to time zones or seasons. Temporal networks are difficult
to evaluate because of their time complexity, and in this study, we proposed an
evaluation method using the probability density function of travel time. The
other method is to define a time-dependent traveling salesman problem and find
an efficient traveling route by finding the shortest path. By creating a

Dynamic perturbation spreading in networks,2021-06-01T12:02:35Z,"Malte SchrÃ¶der, Xiaozhu Zhang, Justine Wolter, Marc Timme","Understanding how local perturbations induce the transient dynamics of a
network of coupled units is essential to control and operate such systems.
Often a perturbation initiated in one unit spreads to other units whose
dynamical state they transiently alter. The maximum state changes at those
units and the timings of these changes constitute key characteristics of such
transient response dynamics. However, even for linear dynamical systems it is
not possible to analytically determine time and amplitude of the maximal
response of a unit to a perturbation. Here, we propose to extract approximate
peak times and amplitudes from effective expectation values used to
characterize the typical time and magnitude of the response of a unit by
interpreting the system's response as a probability distribution over time. We
derive analytic estimators for the peak response based on these expectation
value measures in linearized systems operating close to a stable fixed point.
These estimators can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the system's
Jacobian. We obtain identical results with different approximations for the
response dynamics, indicating that these estimators become exact in the limit
of weak coupling. Furthermore, the results suggest that perturbations spread

fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using commodity WiFi without
requiring user to wear any sensors. Our system takes advantages of the
fine-grained Channel State Information available from commodity WiFi devices
and the prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and identifies
subtle movements of finger gestures by examining the unique patterns exhibited
in the detailed CSI. We devise environmental noise removal mechanism to
mitigate the effect of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover,
we propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with individual

some features correlate with labels but are not causal; relying on such
features prevents models from generalizing to unseen environments where such
correlations break. In this work, we focus on image classification and propose
two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. Given human annotations
of the subset of the features responsible (causal) for the labels (e.g.
bounding boxes), we modify this causal set to generate a surrogate image that
no longer has the same label (i.e. a counterfactual image). We also alter
non-causal features to generate images still recognized as the original labels,
which helps to learn a model invariant to these features. In several
challenging datasets, our data generations outperform state-of-the-art methods

(1) weights modifications, (2) interference, and (3) projection drift. In this
paper, our goal is to provide more insights into how changing the output layer
parameterization may address (1) and (2). Some potential solutions to those
issues are proposed and evaluated here in several continual learning scenarios.
We show that the best-performing type of output layer depends on the data
distribution drifts and/or the amount of data available. In particular, in some
cases where a standard linear layer would fail, changing parameterization is
sufficient to achieve a significantly better performance, without introducing
any continual-learning algorithm but instead by using standard SGD to train a

neighboring (liquid, vapor, and solid) atoms. This definition naturally adapts
to the location of the menisci relative to the walls and can properly model the
behavior of the liquid adsorbed layers. Unlike the density cutoff methods
frequently used in the literature that suffer from density layering effects,
this new method gives smooth and continuous liquid-vapor interfaces in
nanoconfinements. Surface tension values calculated from the equilibrium MD

Cohomological DT invariants from localization,2021-06-04T14:36:13Z,Pierre Descombes,"Given a quiver with potential associated to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, the
numerical Donaldson-Thomas invariants for the moduli space of framed
representations can be computed by using toric localization, which reduces the
problem to the enumeration of molten crystals. We provide a refinement of this
localization procedure, which allows to compute motivic Donaldson-Thomas
invariants. Using this approach, we prove a universal formula which gives the
BPS invariants of any toric quiver, up to undetermined contributions which are
invariant under Poincar\'e duality. When the toric Calabi-Yau threefold has
compact divisors, these self-Poincar\'e dual contributions have a complicated
dependance on the stability parameters, but explicit computations suggest that
they drastically simplify for the self-stability condition (also called
attractor chamber). We conjecture a universal formula for the attractor
invariants, which applies to any toric Calabi-Yau singularity with compact
divisors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02518v2
Popular individuals process the world in particularly normative ways,2021-06-04T21:24:08Z,"Elisa C. Baek, Ryan Hyon, Karina LÃ³pez, Emily S. Finn, Mason A. Porter, Carolyn Parkinson","People differ in how they attend to, interpret, and respond to their

network analysis to investigate whether the most central individuals in their

process the world in a particularly normative way. We found that more central
individuals had exceptionally similar neural responses to their peers and
especially to each other in brain regions that are associated with high-level
interpretations and social cognition (e.g., in the default-mode network),

Self-reported enjoyment of and interest in stimuli followed a similar pattern,

Anomalous Elasticity and Screening in Amorphous Solids,2021-06-06T07:11:48Z,"AnaÃ«l LemaÃ®tre, Chandana Mondal, Michael Moshe, Itamar Procaccia, Saikat Roy, Keren Screiber-ReÃ©m","Amorphous solids appear to react elastically to small external strains, but
in contrast to ideal elastic media, plastic responses abound immediately, at
any value of the strain. Such plastic responses are quasi-localized in nature,
with the ``cheapest"" one being a quadrupolar source. The existence of such
plastic responses results in {\em screened elasticity} in which strains and
stresses can either quantitatively or qualitatively differ from the un-screened
theory, depending on the specific screening mechanism. Here we offer a theory
of such screening effects by plastic quadrupoles, dipoles and monopoles,
explain their natural appearance, and point out the analogy to electrostatic
screening by electric charges and dipoles. For low density of quadrupoles the
effect is to normalize the elastic moduli without a qualitative change compared
to pure elasticity theory; for higher density of quadrupoles the screening
effects result in qualitative changes. Predictions for the spatial dependence
of displacement fields caused by local sources of strains are provided and
compared to numerical simulations. We find that anomalous elasticity is richer
than electrostatics in having a screening mode that does not appear in the
electrostatic analog",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03053v1

tuning magnetic states through layer rotations. Here, we introduce a
mathematical approach to obtain moir\'e patterns in twisted hexagonal bilayers

our approach, we apply it to find moir\'e structures with
$\theta=21.79^{\circ}$ and $32.20^{\circ}$ in the phases R$\bar{3}$ and C2/m of

computed by \textit{Ab-Initio} methodologies. Results show the presence of
rotation-angle-dependent magnetic configurations and steep modifications of the

Sub-trajectory Similarity Join with Obfuscation,2021-06-07T06:08:06Z,"Yanchuan Chang, Jianzhong Qi, Egemen Tanin, Xingjun Ma, Hanan Samet","User trajectory data is becoming increasingly accessible due to the
prevalence of GPS-equipped devices such as smartphones. Many existing studies
focus on querying trajectories that are similar to each other in their
entirety. We observe that trajectories partially similar to each other contain
useful information about users' travel patterns which should not be ignored.
Such partially similar trajectories are critical in applications such as
epidemic contact tracing. We thus propose to query trajectories that are within
a given distance range from each other for a given period of time. We formulate
this problem as a sub-trajectory similarity join query named as the STS-Join.
We further propose a distributed index structure and a query algorithm for
STS-Join, where users retain their raw location data and only send obfuscated
trajectories to a server for query processing. This helps preserve user
location privacy which is vital when dealing with such data. Theoretical
analysis and experiments on real data confirm the effectiveness and the
efficiency of our proposed index structure and query algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03355v1

Studies have indicated that shared steering control, which actively provides
haptic guidance torque on the steering wheel, effectively improves the
performance of distracted drivers. Recently, adaptive shared steering control
based on the physiological status of the driver has been developed, although
its effect on distracted driver behavior remains unclear. To this end, a
high-fidelity driving simulator experiment was conducted involving 18
participants performing double lane changes. The experimental conditions
comprised two driver states: attentive and distracted. Under each condition,
evaluations were performed on three types of haptic guidance: none (manual),
fixed authority, and adaptive authority based on feedback from the forearm
surface electromyography of the driver. Evaluation results indicated that, for
both attentive and distracted drivers, haptic guidance with adaptive authority
yielded lower driver workload and reduced lane departure risk than manual
driving and fixed authority. Moreover, there was a tendency for distracted
drivers to reduce grip strength on the steering wheel to follow the haptic
guidance with fixed authority, resulting in a relatively shorter double lane
change duration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03364v1
Commutative Lie Group VAE for Disentanglement Learning,2021-06-07T07:03:14Z,"Xinqi Zhu, Chang Xu, Dacheng Tao","We view disentanglement learning as discovering an underlying structure that
equivariantly reflects the factorized variations shown in data. Traditionally,
such a structure is fixed to be a vector space with data variations represented
by translations along individual latent dimensions. We argue this simple
structure is suboptimal since it requires the model to learn to discard the
properties (e.g. different scales of changes, different levels of abstractness)
of data variations, which is an extra work than equivariance learning. Instead,
we propose to encode the data variations with groups, a structure not only can
equivariantly represent variations, but can also be adaptively optimized to
preserve the properties of data variations. Considering it is hard to conduct
training on group structures, we focus on Lie groups and adopt a
parameterization using Lie algebra. Based on the parameterization, some
disentanglement learning constraints are naturally derived. A simple model
named Commutative Lie Group VAE is introduced to realize the group-based
disentanglement learning. Experiments show that our model can effectively learn
disentangled representations without supervision, and can achieve
state-of-the-art performance without extra constraints.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03375v1

symptoms, but nowadays people without symptoms are also tested for different
reasons, e.g., during contact tracing, or to be allowed on an (international)
flight. Interestingly, this opens new possibilities to separately investigate
risk factors for infection and risk factors for becoming diseased. To use this

Correcting Momentum in Temporal Difference Learning,2021-06-07T20:41:15Z,"Emmanuel Bengio, Joelle Pineau, Doina Precup","A common optimization tool used in deep reinforcement learning is momentum,
which consists in accumulating and discounting past gradients, reapplying them
at each iteration. We argue that, unlike in supervised learning, momentum in
Temporal Difference (TD) learning accumulates gradients that become doubly
stale: not only does the gradient of the loss change due to parameter updates,
the loss itself changes due to bootstrapping. We first show that this
phenomenon exists, and then propose a first-order correction term to momentum.
We show that this correction term improves sample efficiency in policy
evaluation by correcting target value drift. An important insight of this work
is that deep RL methods are not always best served by directly importing
techniques from the supervised setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03955v1
Parameter Inference with Bifurcation Diagrams,2021-06-08T10:39:19Z,"Gregory Szep, Neil Dalchau, Attila Csikasz-Nagy","Estimation of parameters in differential equation models can be achieved by
applying learning algorithms to quantitative time-series data. However,
sometimes it is only possible to measure qualitative changes of a system in
response to a controlled condition. In dynamical systems theory, such change
points are known as bifurcations and lie on a function of the controlled
condition called the bifurcation diagram. In this work, we propose a
gradient-based approach for inferring the parameters of differential equations
that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram. The cost function contains
an error term that is minimal when the model bifurcations match the specified
targets and a bifurcation measure which has gradients that push optimisers
towards bifurcating parameter regimes. The gradients can be computed without
the need to differentiate through the operations of the solver that was used to
compute the diagram. We demonstrate parameter inference with minimal models
which explore the space of saddle-node and pitchfork diagrams and the genetic
toggle switch from synthetic biology. Furthermore, the cost landscape allows us
to organise models in terms of topological and geometric equivalence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04243v3
Observation of mutual extinction and transparency in light scattering,2021-06-08T13:25:00Z,"Alfredo Rates, Ad Lagendijk, Ozan Akdemir, Allard P. Mosk, Willem L. Vos","Interference of scattered waves is fundamental for modern light-scattering
techniques, such as optical wavefront shaping. Recently, a new type of
wavefront shaping was introduced where the extinction is manipulated instead of
the scattered intensity. The underlying idea is that upon changing the phases
or the amplitudes of incident beams, the total extinction will change due to
interference described by the cross terms between different incident beams.
Here, we experimentally demonstrate the mutual extinction and transparency
effects in scattering media, in particular, a human hair and a silicon bar. To
this end, we send two light beams with a variable mutual angle on the sample.
Depending on the relative phase of the incident beams we observe either nearly
zero extinction, mutual transparency, or almost twice the single-beam
extinction, mutual extinction, in agreement with theory. We use an analytical
approximation for the scattering amplitude, starting from a completely opaque
object and we discuss the limitations of our approximation. We discuss the
applications of the mutual extinction and transparency effects in various

that SINATRA requires 5MB to store such events, and the memory grows at a
modest rate of 23.1KB/s as the user keeps interacting with each page. When an
update becomes available, SINATRA transfer the state by re-executing the same
set of non-deterministic events on the new browser. During this time, which can
be as long as 13 seconds, SINATRA uses MVX to allow the user to keep

On the one hand, the qualitative behaviors of the type-III case are similar to
those of the type-I case. On the other hand, the transport coefficients do not

significant attention in machine learning. As causal reasoning has an instinct

well-described by the linear combination of the effective interactions mediated

Dynamic Asymmetric Causality Tests with an Application,2021-06-14T17:17:30Z,Abdulnasser Hatemi-J,"Testing for causation, defined as the preceding impact of the past values of
one variable on the current value of another one when all other pertinent

potential causal connection between variables across time. The current paper
extends therefore the static asymmetric causality tests by making them dynamic

Measuring time with stationary quantum clocks,2021-06-14T18:08:41Z,"Sergii Strelchuk, Mischa P. Woods","Time plays a fundamental role in our ability to make sense of the physical
laws in the world around us. The nature of time has puzzled people -- from the
ancient Greeks to the present day -- resulting in a long running debate between
philosophers and physicists alike to whether time needs change to exist (the
so-called relatival theory), or whether time flows regardless of change (the
so-called substantival theory). One way to decide between the two is to attempt
to measure the flow of time with a stationary clock, since if time were
substantival, the flow of time would manifest itself in the experiment. Alas,
conventional wisdom suggests that in order for a clock to function, it cannot
be a static object, thus rendering this experiment seemingly impossible. Here
we show, with the aid of counterfactual measurements, the surprising result
that a quantum clock can measure the passage of time even while being switched
off, thus lending constructive support for the substantival theory of time.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07684v2
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Conservation Decisions,2021-06-15T16:32:48Z,"Marcus Lapeyrolerie, Melissa S. Chapman, Kari E. A. Norman, Carl Boettiger","Can machine learning help us make better decisions about a changing planet?
In this paper, we illustrate and discuss the potential of a promising corner of
machine learning known as _reinforcement learning_ (RL) to help tackle the most
challenging conservation decision problems. RL is uniquely well suited to
conservation and global change challenges for three reasons: (1) RL explicitly
focuses on designing an agent who _interacts_ with an environment which is
dynamic and uncertain, (2) RL approaches do not require massive amounts of
data, (3) RL approaches would utilize rather than replace existing models,
simulations, and the knowledge they contain. We provide a conceptual and
technical introduction to RL and its relevance to ecological and conservation
challenges, including examples of a problem in setting fisheries quotas and in
managing ecological tipping points. Four appendices with annotated code provide
a tangible introduction to researchers looking to adopt, evaluate, or extend
these approaches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08272v1
Linear-response magnetoresistance effects in chiral systems,2021-06-16T07:22:42Z,"Xu Yang, Bart J. van Wees","The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect enables the detection of
chirality as electrical charge signals. It is often studied using a
two-terminal circuit geometry where a ferromagnet is connected to a chiral
component, and a change of electrical resistance is reported upon magnetization
reversal. This is however not expected in the linear response regime because of
compensating reciprocal processes, limiting the interpretation of experimental
results. Here we show that magnetoresistance effects can indeed appear even in
the linear response regime, either by changing the magnitude or the direction
of the magnetization or an applied magnetic field. We illustrate this in a
spin-valve device and in a chiral thin film as the CISS-induced Hanle
magnetoresistance (CHMR) effect. This effect helps to distinguish
spin-transport-related effects from other effects, and can thereby provide
further insight into the origin of CISS.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08586v2
Velos: One-sided Paxos for RDMA applications,2021-06-16T10:28:31Z,"Rachid Guerraoui, Antoine Murat, Athanasios Xygkis","Modern data centers are becoming increasingly equipped with RDMA-capable
NICs. These devices enable distributed systems to rely on algorithms designed
for shared memory. RDMA allows consensus to terminate within a few microsecond

two-sided operations in case of failure. In this work, we present a new
leader-based consensus algorithm that relies solely on one-sided RDMA verbs.
Our algorithm is based on Paxos, it decides in a single one-sided RDMA
operation in the common case, and changes leader also in a single one-sided
RDMA operation in case of failure. We implement our algorithm in the form of an
SMR system named Velos, and we evaluated our system against the
state-of-the-art competitor Mu. Compared to Mu, our solution adds a small
overhead of approximately 0.6 microseconds in failure-free executions and
shines during failover periods during which it is 13 times faster in changing
leader.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08676v1

state-of-the-art models frequently show abrupt changes in the image appearance

specific losses which help a translation network to learn a smooth and
disentangled latent style space in which: 1) Both intra- and inter-domain
interpolations correspond to gradual changes in the generated images and 2) The
content of the source image is better preserved during the translation.
Moreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the
smoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models. The proposed method
can be plugged into existing translation approaches, and our extensive
experiments on different datasets show that it can significantly boost the

We derive formulas for Fr\'{e}chet derivatives of the expected values of these

of applications, especially in rank aggregation, the task of flattening items

often requires a complex evaluation of multiple factors. In some applications,
it may be important to identify and preserve information about the inherent
non-transitivity, either in the pairwise comparison data itself or in the
latent feature space. In this work, we develop structured models for
non-transitive pairwise comparison matrices that can be exploited to recover
such matrices from incomplete noisy data and thus allow the detection of
non-transitivity. Considering that individuals' tastes and items' latent
features may change over time, we formulate time-varying pairwise comparison
matrix recovery as a dynamic skew-symmetric matrix recovery problem by modeling
changes in the low-rank factors of the pairwise comparison matrix. We provide
theoretical guarantees for the recovery and numerically test the proposed

PAC Prediction Sets Under Covariate Shift,2021-06-17T23:28:42Z,"Sangdon Park, Edgar Dobriban, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani","An important challenge facing modern machine learning is how to rigorously
quantify the uncertainty of model predictions. Conveying uncertainty is
especially important when there are changes to the underlying data distribution
that might invalidate the predictive model. Yet, most existing uncertainty
quantification algorithms break down in the presence of such shifts. We propose
a novel approach that addresses this challenge by constructing \emph{probably
approximately correct (PAC)} prediction sets in the presence of covariate
shift. Our approach focuses on the setting where there is a covariate shift
from the source distribution (where we have labeled training examples) to the
target distribution (for which we want to quantify uncertainty). Our algorithm
assumes given importance weights that encode how the probabilities of the
training examples change under the covariate shift. In practice, importance
weights typically need to be estimated; thus, we extend our algorithm to the
setting where we are given confidence intervals for the importance weights. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on covariate shifts based on
DomainNet and ImageNet. Our algorithm satisfies the PAC constraint, and gives
prediction sets with the smallest average normalized size among approaches that
always satisfy the PAC constraint.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09848v2

has been recently shown to lead to non-exponential spontaneous emission as well
as dissipation-less long-range emitter interactions. In this work, we show how
to further tune these processes by considering anisotropic Dirac cone
dispersions, which include tilted, semi-Dirac, and the recently discovered type
II and III Dirac points. In particular, we show how by changing the anisotropy

in one-parameter exponential families. In addition, we prove that these
guarantees also hold when limiting the algorithm memory to a polylogarithmic
function of the time horizon. These findings open up new perspectives, in
particular for non-stationary scenarios in which the arm distributions evolve
over time. We propose a variant of the algorithm in which only the most recent

which are nothing but the projection of flat-space spinning polynomials onto
the celestial sphere. Furthermore, we derive the celestial dispersion relation,
which relates the imaginary part to the residue of the celestial amplitude for
negative even integer boost weight. The latter is precisely the projection of
low energy EFT coefficients onto the celestial sphere. We demonstrate these

  Molecular Dynamics simulation",2021-06-25T14:34:34Z,"Daniel R Mason, Abdallah Reza, Fredric Granberg, Felix Hofmann","The changing thermal conductivity of an irradiated material is among the
principal design considerations for any nuclear reactor, but at present few
models are capable of predicting these changes starting from an arbitrary
atomistic model. Here we present a simple model for computing the thermal
diffusivity of tungsten, based on the conductivity of the perfect crystal and
resistivity per Frenkel pair, and dividing a simulation into perfect and
athermal regions statistically. This is applied to highly irradiated
microstructures simulated with Molecular Dynamics. A comparison to experiment
shows that simulations closely track observed thermal diffusivity over a range
of doses from the dilute limit of a few Frenkel pairs to the high dose

On Incorporating Inductive Biases into VAEs,2021-06-25T16:34:05Z,"Ning Miao, Emile Mathieu, N. Siddharth, Yee Whye Teh, Tom Rainforth","We explain why directly changing the prior can be a surprisingly ineffective
mechanism for incorporating inductive biases into VAEs, and introduce a simple
and effective alternative approach: Intermediary Latent Space VAEs(InteL-VAEs).
InteL-VAEs use an intermediary set of latent variables to control the
stochasticity of the encoding process, before mapping these in turn to the
latent representation using a parametric function that encapsulates our desired
inductive bias(es). This allows us to impose properties like sparsity or
clustering on learned representations, and incorporate human knowledge into the
generative model. Whereas changing the prior only indirectly encourages
behavior through regularizing the encoder, InteL-VAEs are able to directly
enforce desired characteristics. Moreover, they bypass the computation and
encoder design issues caused by non-Gaussian priors, while allowing for
additional flexibility through training of the parametric mapping function. We
show that these advantages, in turn, lead to both better generative models and
better representations being learned.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13746v2

  Distillation",2021-06-25T07:24:53Z,"Jangho Kim, Simyung Chang, Nojun Kwak","As edge devices become prevalent, deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on
edge devices has become a critical issue. However, DNN requires a high
computational resource which is rarely available for edge devices. To handle
this, we propose a novel model compression method for the devices with limited
computational resources, called PQK consisting of pruning, quantization, and
knowledge distillation (KD) processes. Unlike traditional pruning and KD, PQK
makes use of unimportant weights pruned in the pruning process to make a
teacher network for training a better student network without pre-training the
teacher model. PQK has two phases. Phase 1 exploits iterative pruning and
quantization-aware training to make a lightweight and power-efficient model. In
phase 2, we make a teacher network by adding unimportant weights unused in
phase 1 to a pruned network. By using this teacher network, we train the pruned
network as a student network. In doing so, we do not need a pre-trained teacher
network for the KD framework because the teacher and the student networks
coexist within the same network. We apply our method to the recognition model
and verify the effectiveness of PQK on keyword spotting (KWS) and image
recognition.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14681v1
"TQFT at work for IR-renormalons, resurgence and Lefschetz decomposition",2021-06-28T20:34:04Z,Mithat Ãnsal,"We investigate the implications of coupling a topological quantum field
theory (TQFT) to Yang-Mills theory with $SU(N)$ gauge group in the context of
the IR-renormalon problem. Coupling a TQFT to QFT does not change the local
dynamics and perturbation theory, but it does change the bundle topology.
Crucially, the configurations with integer topological charge but fractional
action contribute to the path integral of the original theory. In the
semi-classical regime, these are critical points at infinity, called neutral
bions, and since ${\rm Arg}(g^2)=0$ is a Stokes line, their Lefschetz thimbles
are two-fold ambiguous. Therein, the ambiguity in the gluon condensate is
sourced by the neutral bions. The Fourier decomposition of multi-branched
observables at strong coupling is compatible with the saddle decomposition at
weak coupling. TQFT coupling and non-renormalization of $\theta$ angle impose
constraints and helps to identify IR-renormalon. In certain IR-CFTs, we prove

An Analysis of Speculative Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in the Wild,2021-06-29T17:41:34Z,"Ofek Kirzner, Adam Morrison","Spectre v1 attacks, which exploit conditional branch misprediction, are often
identified with attacks that bypass array bounds checking to leak data from a
victim's memory. Generally, however, Spectre v1 attacks can exploit any
conditional branch misprediction that makes the victim execute code
incorrectly. In this paper, we investigate speculative type confusion, a
Spectre v1 attack vector in which branch mispredictions make the victim execute
with variables holding values of the wrong type and thereby leak memory
content.
  We observe that speculative type confusion can be inadvertently introduced by
a compiler, making it extremely hard for programmers to reason about security
and manually apply Spectre mitigations. We thus set out to determine the extent
to which speculative type confusion affects the Linux kernel. Our analysis
finds exploitable and potentially-exploitable arbitrary memory disclosure
vulnerabilities. We also find many latent vulnerabilities, which could become
exploitable due to innocuous system changes, such as coding style changes.

more comprehensive mitigations are needed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15601v2
Monocular 3D Object Detection: An Extrinsic Parameter Free Approach,2021-06-30T03:35:51Z,"Yunsong Zhou, Yuan He, Hongzi Zhu, Cheng Wang, Hongyang Li, Qinhong Jiang","Monocular 3D object detection is an important task in autonomous driving. It
can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground
plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and
slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods
on open datasets neglect the camera pose information, which inevitably results
in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The
perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for
industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera
pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically,
the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting
vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify
perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works
independent of the extrinsic parameter variations and produces accurate results
in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing
monocular detectors fail to handle. Experiments demonstrate our method yields
the best performance compared with the other state-of-the-arts by a large

  Design: Polarisation-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) images

  Results: The PS-OCT system was capable of imaging the entire equine

theory for index two subgroups and self-dual/conjugate-dual representations.
When applied to semi-simple representations of the Weil-Deligne group $W'_F$ of
a non Archimedean local field $F$, and further translated in terms of
representations of $\mathrm{GL_n}(F)$ via the local Langlands correspondence
when $F$ has characteristic zero, it yields various statements concerning the
behaviour of different types of distinction under quadratic base change and
automorphic induction. When $F$ has residual characteristic different from $2$,
combining of one of the simple results that we obtain with the tiviality of
conjugate-orthogonal root numbers (proved by Gan, Gross and Prasad), we recover
without using the LLC a result of Serre on the parity of the Artin conductor of

Culling the herd of moments with penalized empirical likelihood,2021-08-07T07:03:41Z,"Jinyuan Chang, Zhentao Shi, Jia Zhang","Models defined by moment conditions are at the center of structural
econometric estimation, but economic theory is mostly agnostic about moment
selection. While a large pool of valid moments can potentially improve
estimation efficiency, in the meantime a few invalid ones may undermine
consistency. This paper investigates the empirical likelihood estimation of
these moment-defined models in high-dimensional settings. We propose a
penalized empirical likelihood (PEL) estimation and establish its oracle
property with consistent detection of invalid moments. The PEL estimator is
asymptotically normally distributed, and a projected PEL procedure further
eliminates its asymptotic bias and provides more accurate normal approximation
to the finite sample behavior. Simulation exercises demonstrate excellent
numerical performance of these methods in estimation and inference.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03382v4

Are $\mathfrak a$ and $\mathfrak d$ your cup of tea? Revisited,2021-08-08T15:29:43Z,Saharon Shelah,"This is a revised version (of late 2020) of [Sh:700], which is
arXiv:math/0012170 .
  First point is noting that the proof of Theorem 4.3 in [Sh:700], which says
that the proof giving the consistency $ \mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{d} =
\mathfrak{u} < \mathfrak{a} $ also gives $ \mathfrak{s} = \mathfrak{d} $. The
proof uses a measurable cardinal and a c.c.c. forcing so it gives large $
\mathfrak{d} $ and assumes a large cardinal.
  Second point is adding to the results of \S2,\S3 which say that (in \S3 with
no large cardinals) we can force $ {\aleph_1} < \mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{d} <
\mathfrak{a}$. We like to have $ {\aleph_1} < \mathfrak{s} \le \mathfrak{b} =
\mathfrak{d} < \mathfrak{a} $. For this we allow in \S2,\S3 the sets $ K_t $ to
be uncountable; this requires non-essential changes. In particular, we replace
usually $ {\aleph_0}, {\aleph_1} $ by $ \sigma , \partial $. Naturally we can
deal with $ \mathfrak{i} $ and similar invariants.
  Third we proofread the work again. To get $ \mathfrak{s} $ we could have
retained the countability of the member of the $ I_t$-s but the parameters
would change with $ A \in I_t$, well for a cofinal set of them; but the present
seems simpler.
  We intend to continue in [Sh:F2009].",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03666v1

high-entropy ferritic-steels (HEFSs) due to their critical technological
application. The chemical inhomogeneity arising from mixing of multi-principal

linear-response theory, we predict the effect of compositional tuning on the
order-disorder transformation in ferritic steels -focusing on Cr-Ni-Al-Ti-Fe

update scheme of Cohen-Steiner, Edelsbrunner, and Morozov for permutations by
additionally handling addition and deletion of cells in a filtered topological
space and by processing changes in a single batch. We show that the complexity
of our scheme scales with the number of elementary changes to the filtration

infilling, i.e., to generate a polyphonic music sequence that fills in the gap

in a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between
the past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes
(up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical
contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally
proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second,
we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar
encoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and
future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform
look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before
predicting the other attributes of the note. We compare our proposed model with

demonstrate how CETIs may relate to each other in technological age as well as
how the dynamics of the concurrent CETI population change under basic models of

differential equations with lumped controls. The change of coordinates induced
by Brunovsky's normal form allows us to remove the restriction of having to
work with diagonalizable system dynamics, and does not entail a randomization
procedure as done in past literature on diffusion equations or waves. Instead,
the optimization problem reduces to a minimization of the norm of the inverse
of a change of basis matrix, and allows for an easy deduction of existence of
solutions, and for a clearer picture of some of the problem's intrinsic

Tunable single-mode laser on thin film lithium niobate,2021-08-22T14:42:54Z,"Xiangmin Liu, Xiongshuo Yan, Yi'an Liu, Hao Li, Yuping Chen, Xianfeng Chen","Erbium-doped lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) laser plays an important
role in the complete photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Here, we demonstrate
an integrated tunable whisper galley single mode laser (WGSML) by making use of
a pair of coupled microdisk and microring on LNOI. A 974 nm single-mode pump
light can have an excellent resonance in the designed microdisk, which is
beneficial to the whisper gallery mode (WGM) laser generation. The WGSML at
1560.40 nm with a maximum 31.4 dB side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) has been
achieved. By regulating the temperature, WGSMLs output power increased and the
central wavelength can be changed from 1560.30 nm to 1560.40 nm. What's more,
1560.60 nm and 1565.00 nm WGSMLs have been achieved by changing the coupling

Temporal Network Embedding via Tensor Factorization,2021-08-22T20:50:38Z,"Jing Ma, Qiuchen Zhang, Jian Lou, Li Xiong, Joyce C. Ho","Representation learning on static graph-structured data has shown a
significant impact on many real-world applications. However, less attention has
been paid to the evolving nature of temporal networks, in which the edges are
often changing over time. The embeddings of such temporal networks should
encode both graph-structured information and the temporally evolving pattern.
Existing approaches in learning temporally evolving network representations
fail to capture the temporal interdependence. In this paper, we propose Toffee,
a novel approach for temporal network representation learning based on tensor
decomposition. Our method exploits the tensor-tensor product operator to encode
the cross-time information, so that the periodic changes in the evolving

Reachability of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics,2021-08-25T04:50:31Z,"Taha Shafa, Melkior Ornik","Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear control system is crucial

the system's dynamics are not fully known. This paper is motivated by a
scenario where a system suffers an adverse event mid-operation, resulting in a
substantial change to the system's dynamics, rendering them largely unknown.
Our objective is to conservatively approximate the system's reachable set
solely from its local dynamics at a single point and the bounds on the rate of
change of its dynamics. We translate this knowledge about the system dynamics
into an ordinary differential inclusion. We then derive a conservative
approximation of the velocities available to the system at every system state.
An inclusion using this approximation can be interpreted as a control system;
the trajectories of the derived control system are guaranteed to be

  turbulence driving",2021-08-26T10:10:01Z,Martin Pohl,"Cosmic-ray acceleration at non-relativistic shocks relies on scattering by
turbulence that the cosmic rays drive upstream of the shock. We explore the
rate of energy transfer from cosmic rays to non-resonant Bell modes and the
spectral softening it implies. Accounting for the finite time available for
turbulence driving at supernova-remnant shocks yields a smaller spectral impact
than found earlier with steady-state considerations. Generally, for diffusion
scaling with the Bohm rate by a factor $\eta$, the change in spectral index is
at most $\eta$ divided by the Alfv\'enic Mach number of the thermal sub-shock.
For $M_\mathrm{A}\lesssim 50$ it is well below this limit. Only for very fast
shocks and very efficient cosmic-ray acceleration the change in spectral index
may reach $0.1$. For standard SNR parameters it is negligible. Independent
confirmation is derived by considering the synchrotron energy losses of
electrons: if intense nonthermal multi-keV emission is produced, the energy
loss, and hence the spectral steepening, is very small for hadronic cosmic rays
that produce TeV-band gamma-ray emission.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11688v1

Modularity and Heavy-Tailed Degree Distributions,2021-08-30T18:06:18Z,Larry Wilson,"Identifying clusters of vertices in graphs continues to be an important
problem, and modularity continues to be used as a tool for solving the problem.
Modularity, which measures the quality of a division of the vertices into
clusters, explicitly treats vertices of different degrees differently, imposing
a larger penalty when high-degree vertices are put in the same cluster. We
claim that this unequal treatment negatively impacts the performance of
clustering algorithms based on modularity for graphs with heavy-tailed degree
distributions. We used the Greedy Modularity hill-climb to find clusters in
graphs with power-law degree distributions and observed that it performed
poorly clustering low-degree vertices. We propose a simple variant of
modularity that we call flat modularity. We found that, using the same
algorithm with the modified score instead, we improved the performance of the
clustering algorithm on low-degree vertices and the overall performance as
well. We believe that the small change -- from modularity to flat modularity --
could improve the output in the many real-world processes that rely on
modularity to measure the quality of a division into clusters with only a small

Batch size-invariance for policy optimization,2021-10-01T20:33:08Z,"Jacob Hilton, Karl Cobbe, John Schulman","We say an algorithm is batch size-invariant if changes to the batch size can
largely be compensated for by changes to other hyperparameters. Stochastic
gradient descent is well-known to have this property at small batch sizes, via
the learning rate. However, some policy optimization algorithms (such as PPO)
do not have this property, because of how they control the size of policy
updates. In this work we show how to make these algorithms batch
size-invariant. Our key insight is to decouple the proximal policy (used for
controlling policy updates) from the behavior policy (used for off-policy
corrections). Our experiments help explain why these algorithms work, and
additionally show how they can make more efficient use of stale data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00641v3
Joint Estimation of System Inertia and Load Relief,2021-10-02T01:00:22Z,"Julius Susanto, Alireza Fereidouni, Dean Sharafi","Modern power systems with high share of renewable generation are at the risk
of rapid changes in frequency and inertia resulting from contingencies. The
importance of an accurate assessment of system and load relief, as well as
frequency changes in the critical timescales is more pronounced in these power
systems. This knowledge serves as an insight which will guide the solutions
required for enhanced security and resilience. A novel procedure for
simultaneously assessing system inertia and load relief using a closed-form
system frequency response (SFR) model to fit measured disturbance data is
presented. Results of applying the proposed approach on generator contingencies

Weakly Durable High-Performance Transactions,2021-10-04T14:03:20Z,"Yun-Sheng Chang, Yu-Fang Chen, Hsiang-Shang Ko","Existing disk-based database systems largely fall into two categories -- they
either provide very high performance but few guarantees, or expose the
transaction abstraction satisfying the full ACID guarantees at the cost of
lower performance. In this paper, we present an alternative that achieves the
best of both worlds, namely good performance and transactional properties. Our
key observation is that, because of the frequent use of synchronization
primitives, systems with strong durability can hardly utilize the extremely
high parallelism granted by modern storage devices. Thus, we explore the notion
of weakly durable transactions, and discuss how to safely relax durability
without compromising other transactional properties. We present AciKV, a
transactional system whose design is centered around weak durability. AciKV
exposes to users the normal transactional interface, but what sets it apart
from others is a new ""persist"" primitive that decouples durability from commit.
AciKV is a middle ground between systems that perform fast atomic operations,
and ones that support transactions; this middle ground is useful as it provides
similar performance to the former, while prevents isolation and consistency
anomalies like the latter. Our evaluation using the YCSB benchmark shows that
AciKV, under workloads that involve write requests, exhibits more than two
orders of magnitude higher throughput than existing strongly durable systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01465v1
Quantified Facial Expressiveness for Affective Behavior Analytics,2021-10-05T00:21:33Z,"Md Taufeeq Uddin, Shaun Canavan","The quantified measurement of facial expressiveness is crucial to analyze
human affective behavior at scale. Unfortunately, methods for expressiveness

study of discrete expression. In this work, we propose an algorithm that
quantifies facial expressiveness using a bounded, continuous expressiveness
score using multimodal facial features, such as action units (AUs), landmarks,
head pose, and gaze. The proposed algorithm more heavily weights AUs with high
intensities and large temporal changes. The proposed algorithm can compute the
expressiveness in terms of discrete expression, and can be used to perform
tasks including facial behavior tracking and subjectivity quantification in

effective in terms of capturing temporal changes and expressiveness, measuring
subjective differences in context, and extracting useful insight.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01758v2

$n+p\rightarrow n+p+a$, and these processes can be the dominant source of
axions for some region in the axion parameter space or in astrophysical

Carbon nanotube transistors have advantages over MOSFETs, such as the same

by changing the nanotube diameter, and less leakage power. The proposed half
adder has lower power consumption, delay, and fewer transistors compared to
recent ternary half adders that use similar design methods. The proposed 1-trit
multiplier also has a lower delay than other designs. Moreover, these
advantages are achieved over a wide supply voltage range, operating

Word Acquisition in Neural Language Models,2021-10-05T23:26:16Z,"Tyler A. Chang, Benjamin K. Bergen","We investigate how neural language models acquire individual words during
training, extracting learning curves and ages of acquisition for over 600 words
on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson et al.,
2007). Drawing on studies of word acquisition in children, we evaluate multiple
predictors for words' ages of acquisition in LSTMs, BERT, and GPT-2. We find
that the effects of concreteness, word length, and lexical class are pointedly
different in children and language models, reinforcing the importance of
interaction and sensorimotor experience in child language acquisition. Language
models rely far more on word frequency than children, but like children, they
exhibit slower learning of words in longer utterances. Interestingly, models
follow consistent patterns during training for both unidirectional and
bidirectional models, and for both LSTM and Transformer architectures. Models
predict based on unigram token frequencies early in training, before
transitioning loosely to bigram probabilities, eventually converging on more
nuanced predictions. These results shed light on the role of distributional
learning mechanisms in children, while also providing insights for more

Consistent Counterfactuals for Deep Models,2021-10-06T23:48:55Z,"Emily Black, Zifan Wang, Matt Fredrikson, Anupam Datta","Counterfactual examples are one of the most commonly-cited methods for
explaining the predictions of machine learning models in key areas such as
finance and medical diagnosis. Counterfactuals are often discussed under the
assumption that the model on which they will be used is static, but in
deployment models may be periodically retrained or fine-tuned. This paper
studies the consistency of model prediction on counterfactual examples in deep
networks under small changes to initial training conditions, such as weight
initialization and leave-one-out variations in data, as often occurs during
model deployment. We demonstrate experimentally that counterfactual examples
for deep models are often inconsistent across such small changes, and that
increasing the cost of the counterfactual, a stability-enhancing mitigation
suggested by prior work in the context of simpler models, is not a reliable
heuristic in deep networks. Rather, our analysis shows that a model's local
Lipschitz continuity around the counterfactual is key to its consistency across

"A State Transfer Method That Adapts to Network Bandwidth Variations in
  Geographic State Machine Replication",2021-10-09T03:55:31Z,"Tairi Chiba, Ren Ohmura, Junya Nakamura","We present a new state transfer method for geographic State Machine
Replication (SMR) that dynamically allocates the state to be transferred among
replicas according to changes in communication bandwidths. SMR is a method that
improves fault tolerance by replicating a service to multiple replicas. When a
replica is newly added or is recovered from a failure, the other replicas
transfer the current state of the service to it. However, in geographic SMR,
the communication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.
Therefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available
bandwidth, and their state transfer time becomes long. To overcome this
problem, our method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to
replicas based on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's
bandwidth is, the more chunks it transfers. The number of assigned chunks is
dynamically updated based on the currently estimated bandwidth. The performance
evaluation on Amazon EC2 shows that the proposed method reduces the state
transfer time by up to 47% compared with the existing one.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04448v1

there exists no obvious gap between different domains. This paper intends to
build the model for I2I translation among continuous varying domains. We first
divide the whole domain coverage into discrete intervals, and explicitly model
the latent style code for the center of each interval. To deal with continuous
translation, we design the editing modules, changing the latent style code
along two directions. These editing modules help to constrain the codes for
domain centers during training, so that the model can better understand the
relation among them. To have diverse results, the latent style code is further
diversified with either the random noise or features from the reference image,
giving the individual style code to the decoder for label-based or
reference-based synthesis. Extensive experiments on age and viewing angle

it is also flexible for users.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05052v1

Motivating Effort with Information about Future Rewards,2021-10-11T23:19:42Z,Chang Liu,"This paper studies the optimal mechanism to motivate effort in a dynamic
principal-agent model without transfers. An agent is engaged in a task with
uncertain future rewards and can shirk irreversibly at any time. The principal
knows the reward of the task and provides information to the agent over time in
order to motivate effort. We derive the optimal information policy in closed
form and thus identify two conditions, each of which guarantees that delayed
disclosure is valuable. First, if the principal is impatient compared to the
agent, she prefers the front-loaded effort schedule induced by delayed
disclosure. In a stationary environment, delayed disclosure is beneficial if
and only if the principal is less patient than the agent. Second, if the
environment makes the agent become pessimistic over time in absence of any
information disclosure, then providing delayed news can counteract this
downward trend in the agent's belief and encourage the agent to work longer.
Notably, the level of patience remains a crucial determinant of the optimal
policy structure.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05643v3

structures undergo transverse compaction during composite manufacturing which
changes the fabric thickness and ultimately fibre volume fraction of

compaction behaviour during composite forming to study the thickness changes of
these fabrics under pressures between 1 and 10 bars. A range of composite
manufacturing processes including vacuum infusion, autoclave curing and resin
transfer moulding were utilised. These fabrics were studied in single and multi
layer states, in dry and wet states, under different loading cycles and in
different orientations of the fabric plies (00/00 and 00/900). Nesting of the
layers has been calculated for single plies and for multi-layer stacks of dry
fabrics. It was observed that under transverse compression, the structure of
the preform plays a vital role in determining the thickness of the preform. The

that describe the changes in the replicas compared to the original structure,
and then determine the maximal subsequences of each that can be propagated to
the other. The proposed command set is shown to be functionally complete, and
an update detection algorithm is presented which produces a command sequence
transforming the original data structure into the replica while traversing both

"Relation Preserving Triplet Mining for Stabilising the Triplet Loss in
  Re-identification Systems",2021-10-15T08:23:40Z,"Adhiraj Ghosh, Kuruparan Shanmugalingam, Wen-Yan Lin","Object appearances change dramatically with pose variations. This creates a
challenge for embedding schemes that seek to map instances with the same object
ID to locations that are as close as possible. This issue becomes significantly
heightened in complex computer vision tasks such as re-identification(reID). In
this paper, we suggest that these dramatic appearance changes are indications
that an object ID is composed of multiple natural groups, and it is
counterproductive to forcefully map instances from different groups to a common
location. This leads us to introduce Relation Preserving Triplet Mining (RPTM),
a feature-matching guided triplet mining scheme, that ensures that triplets
will respect the natural subgroupings within an object ID. We use this triplet
mining mechanism to establish a pose-aware, well-conditioned triplet loss by
implicitly enforcing view consistency. This allows a single network to be
trained with fixed parameters across datasets while providing state-of-the-art
results. Code is available at https://github.com/adhirajghosh/RPTM_reid.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07933v2

A QP perspective on topology change in Poisson-Lie T-duality,2021-10-15T16:11:56Z,"Alex S. Arvanitakis, Chris D. A. Blair, Daniel C. Thompson","We describe topological T-duality and Poisson-Lie T-duality in terms of QP

certain canonical transformations play a vital role. In the presence of
spectator coordinates, we show how the introduction of ""bibundle"" structure on
correspondence space realises changes in the global fibration structure under

their cellular environment and macromolecular composition. In the past decade,
simple quantitative laws have emerged that connect cell growth to proteomic

"Geometry of radio pulsar signals: The origin of pulsation modes and
  nulling",2021-10-20T16:57:21Z,J. Dyks,"Radio pulsars exhibit an enormous diversity of single pulse behaviour that
involves sudden changes in pulsation mode and nulling occurring on timescales
of tens or hundreds of spin periods. The pulsations appear both chaotic and
quasi-regular, which has hampered their interpretation for decades. Here I show
that the pseudo-chaotic complexity of single pulses is caused by the viewing of
a relatively simple radio beam that has a sector structure traceable to the
magnetospheric charge distribution. The slow ExB drift of the sector beam, when
sampled by the line of sight, produces the classical drift-period-folded
patterns known from observations. The drifting azimuthal zones of the beam
produce the changes in pulsation modes and both the intermodal and sporadic
nulling at timescales of beating between the drift and the star spin. The
axially symmetric conal beams are thus a superficial geometric illusion, and
the standard carousel model of pulsar radio beams does not apply. The beam
suggests a particle flow structure that involves inward motions with possible

of three contributions, coming from the DM-induced changes in atomic internal

"MEKF Ignoring Initial Conditions for Attitude Estimation Using Vector
  Observations",2021-10-26T12:58:33Z,Lubin Chang,"In this paper, the well-known multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) is
re-investigated for attitude estimation using vector observations. From the Lie
group theory, it is shown that the attitude estimation model is group affine
and its error state model should be trajectory-independent. Moreover, with such
trajectory-independent error state model, the linear Kalman filter is still
effective for large initialization errors. However, the measurement model of
the traditional MEKF is dependent on the attitude prediction, which is
therefore trajectory-dependent. This is also the main reason why the
performance of traditional MEKF is degraded for large initialization errors.
Through substitution of the attitude prediction related term with the vector
observation in body frame, a trajectory-independent measurement model is
derived for MEKF. Meanwhile, the MEKFs with reference attitude error definition
and with global state formulating on special Euclidean group have also been
studied, with main focus on derivation of the trajectory-independent
measurement models. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field test of
attitude estimation implementations demonstrate that the performance of MEKFs
can be much improved with trajectory-independent measurement models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13666v1
Dynamic Trace Estimation,2021-10-26T15:03:32Z,"Prathamesh Dharangutte, Christopher Musco","We study a dynamic version of the implicit trace estimation problem. Given

repeatedly applying Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator. We also provide an
improved algorithm assuming slightly stronger assumptions on the dynamic matrix

model size and timing limitations are two significant obstacles against such an
autonomous decision-making process. To tackle this issue, the incremental
approximation technique can be used to partition the model and only verify a
partition if it is affected by the change. This paper proposes a policy-based
analysis approach that finds the best partitioning policy among a set of
available policies based on two proposed metrics, namely Balancing and
Variation. The metrics quantitatively evaluate the generated components from
the incremental approximation scheme according to their size and frequency. We

Temporal Knowledge Distillation for On-device Audio Classification,2021-10-27T02:29:54Z,"Kwanghee Choi, Martin Kersner, Jacob Morton, Buru Chang","Improving the performance of on-device audio classification models remains a
challenge given the computational limits of the mobile environment. Many

transferring the knowledge from large models to on-device models. However, most
lack a mechanism to distill the essence of the temporal information, which is
crucial to audio classification tasks, or similar architecture is often
required. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation method
designed to incorporate the temporal knowledge embedded in attention weights of
large transformer-based models into on-device models. Our distillation method
is applicable to various types of architectures, including the
non-attention-based architectures such as CNNs or RNNs, while retaining the

Angular-spectrum-dependent interference,2021-10-27T02:30:39Z,"Chen Yang, Zhi-Yuan Zhou, Yan Li, Shi-Kai Liu, Zheng Ge, Guang-Can Guo, Bao-Sen Shi","Optical interference is not only a fundamental phenomenon that has enabled
new theories of light to be derived but it has also been used in interferometry

surface irregularities. In a two-beam interferometer, variations in the
interference fringes are used as a diagnostic for anything that causes the
optical path difference (OPD) to change; therefore, for a specified OPD,
greater variation in the fringes indicates better measurement sensitivity.
Here, we introduce and experimentally validate an interesting optical
interference phenomenon that uses photons with a structured frequency-angular
spectrum, which are generated from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion
process in a nonlinear crystal. This interference phenomenon is manifested as
interference fringes that vary much more rapidly with increasing OPD than the
corresponding fringes for equal-inclination interference; the phenomenon is
parameterised using an equivalent wavelength, which under our experimental

time variation of the atmospheric neutrino flux at five prospective underground
locations for multi-tonne scale dark matter detectors (CJPL, Kamioka, LNGS,

normalization of the flux changes by $\sim 30\%$ at a high-latitude location

data growth is hard to manage and it reduces the agility of the models'

combination of large refractive index contrast and ultralow losses seen in
Sb$_2$Se$_3$ facilitates an unprecedented optical phase control exceeding

Active elastocapillarity in soft solids with negative surface tension,2021-01-11T16:28:30Z,"Jack Binysh, Thomas R. Wilks, Anton Souslov","Active solids consume energy to allow for actuation, shape change, and wave
propagation not possible in equilibrium. Whereas active interfaces have been
realized across many experimental systems, control of three-dimensional (3D)
bulk materials remains a challenge. Here, we develop continuum theory and
microscopic simulations that describe a 3D soft solid whose boundary
experiences active surface stresses. The competition between active boundary
and elastic bulk yields a broad range of previously unexplored phenomena, which
are demonstrations of so-called active elastocapillarity. In contrast to thin
shells and vesicles, we discover that bulk 3D elasticity controls snap-through
transitions between different anisotropic shapes. These transitions meet at a
critical point, allowing a universal classification via Landau theory. The
active surface modifies elastic wave propagation to allow zero, or even
negative, group velocities. These phenomena offer robust principles for

of the enormous search space and the existence of Markov equivalent DAGs.
Theoretical results on the mixing behavior are lacking. In this work, we prove
the rapid mixing of a random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which reveals
that the complexity of Bayesian learning of sparse equivalence classes grows
only polynomially in $n$ and $p$, under some high-dimensional assumptions. A
series of high-dimensional consistency results is obtained, including the
strong selection consistency of an empirical Bayes model for structure
learning. Our proof is based on two new results. First, we derive a general
mixing time bound on finite state spaces, which can be applied to local MCMC
schemes for other model selection problems. Second, we construct
high-probability search paths on the space of equivalence classes with node
degree constraints by proving a combinatorial property of DAG comparisons.
Simulation studies on the proposed MCMC sampler are conducted to illustrate the

Droplet Splashing on Rough Surfaces,2021-01-13T14:31:47Z,"T. C. de Goede, K. G. de Bruin, N. Shahidzadeh, D. Bonn","When a droplet hits a surface fast enough, droplet splashing can occur:
smaller secondary droplets detach from the main droplet during impact. While
droplet splashing on smooth surfaces is by now well understood, the surface
roughness also affects at which impact velocity a droplet splashes. In this

investigated. By changing the root mean square roughness of the impacted
surface, we show that the droplet splashing velocity is only affected when the
droplet roughness is large enough to disrupt the spreading droplet lamella and
change the droplet splashing mechanism from corona to prompt splashing.
Finally, using Weber and Ohnesorge number scaling models, we also show that the

Integrative Learning for Population of Dynamic Networks with Covariates,2021-01-14T10:29:08Z,"Suprateek Kundu, Jin Ming, Joe Nocera, Keith M. McGregor","Although there is a rapidly growing literature on dynamic connectivity
methods, the primary focus has been on separate network estimation for each
individual, which fails to leverage common patterns of information. We propose
novel graph-theoretic approaches for estimating a population of dynamic
networks that are able to borrow information across multiple heterogeneous
samples in an unsupervised manner and guided by covariate information.
Specifically, we develop a Bayesian product mixture model that imposes
independent mixture priors at each time scan and uses covariates to model the
mixture weights, which results in time-varying clusters of samples designed to
pool information. The computation is carried out using an efficient
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Extensive simulation studies illustrate
sharp gains in recovering the true dynamic network over existing dynamic
connectivity methods. An analysis of fMRI block task data with behavioral
interventions reveal sub-groups of individuals having similar dynamic
connectivity, and identifies intervention-related dynamic network changes that
are concentrated in biologically interpretable brain regions. In contrast,
existing dynamic connectivity approaches are able to detect minimal or no
changes in connectivity over time, which seems biologically unrealistic and
highlights the challenges resulting from the inability to systematically borrow
information across samples.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05539v1

formulate such a behavior planning problem as a partially observable Markov

cooperativeness levels, we learn the human behavior models from real traffic

retrieval algorithm is limited in some areas of critical importance for carbon
cycle science. Mixed land/water pixels along the coastline are also not used in
the retrieval processing due to the lack of valid ancillary variables including
land fraction. We propose an approach to model spatial spectral data to solve
these two problems by radiance imputation and land fraction estimation. The
spectral observations are modeled as spatially indexed functional data with

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to replace traditional time-consuming
Geant4 simulations based on the Monte Carlo method. In parallel with advances
in deep learning, intriguing studies have been conducted in the last decade on
quantum computing, including the Quantum GAN model suggested by IBM. However,
this model is limited in learning a probability distribution over discrete
variables, while we initially aim to reproduce a distribution over continuous

a strong coupling of light with materials inside the cavity. This gives rise to
new states where quantum fluctuations of light and matter can alter the
properties of the material altogether. Here we demonstrate, based on first
principles calculations, that such light-matter coupling induces a change of
the collective phase from quantum paraelectric to ferroelectric in the
SrTiO$_3$ groundstate, which has thus far only been achieved in
out-of-equilibrium strongly excited conditions[1, 2]. This is a
light-matter-hybrid groundstate which can only exist because of the coupling to
the vacuum fluctuations of light, a ""photo-groundstate"". The phase transition
is accompanied by changes in the crystal structure, showing that fundamental
groundstate properties of materials can be controlled via strong light-matter

individual large spherical voids, aligned along the dislocation core. The
creation of voids could facilitate interactions between dislocations, enabling
the dislocation network to change its connectivity in a way that facilitates
the subsequent annihilation of dislocation segments. This confirms that
thermally activated processes such as state diffusion of porous materials
provide mechanisms whereby the defects are removed or arranged in

Learning User Preferences in Non-Stationary Environments,2021-01-29T10:26:16Z,"Wasim Huleihel, Soumyabrata Pal, Ofer Shayevitz","Recommendation systems often use online collaborative filtering (CF)
algorithms to identify items a given user likes over time, based on ratings
that this user and a large number of other users have provided in the past.
This problem has been studied extensively when users' preferences do not change
over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical
settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary
recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users'
preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide
a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related
non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty
in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain
user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our
algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world
applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the
fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do
not change over time. This hints toward the general conclusion that in

ordering transitions of area-based charts like bar charts, histograms,

hydraulic metaphor to convey the sense of area preservation during animated
transitions: in aquanims, graphical objects can change shape, position, color,
and even connectedness but not displayed area, as for a liquid contained in a
transparent vessel or transferred between such vessels communicating through
hidden pipes. We present various aquanims for product plots like bar charts and
histograms to accommodate changes in data, in the ordering of bars or in a

object detection methods, a significant performance drop is observed when
applied to images captured by UAVs. This is due to large variations in imaging
conditions, such as varying altitudes, dynamically changing viewing angles, and
different capture times. These variations lead to domain imbalances and, thus,
trained models suffering from domain bias. We demonstrate that domain knowledge
is a valuable source of information and thus propose domain-aware object
detectors by using freely accessible sensor data. By splitting the model into
cross-domain and domain-specific parts, substantial performance improvements
are achieved on multiple data sets across various models and metrics without
changing the architecture. In particular, we achieve a new state-of-the-art

key properties, namely the validity of the push-up lemma, the openness of
chronological futures, and the existence of limit causal curves. Recall that if
the spacetime metric is smooth, $(I^+,J^+)$ satisfies all three properties, but
that in the continuous case, the push-up lemma fails. Among the proposed
alternative causal structures, there is one that satisfies push-up and open

Elastic wave velocities in finitely pre-stretched soft fibers,2021-01-30T05:48:04Z,"Shiheng Zhao, Zheng Chang","Elastic wave velocity in a soft fiber that varies depending on material
constitution and axial stress level is an essential measure of mechanical
signals in many technical applications. In this work, based on the
small-on-large theory, we establish a model of linear elastic wave propagation
in a finitely pre-stretched soft fiber. The formulas of longitudinal (Primary,
P-) and transverse (Secondary, S-) wave velocities are provided and validated
by numerical simulations as well as by experimental data on spider silk. The
influences of material constitution, compressibility, and pre-stress on the
wave propagation are investigated. We found that with increasing pre-stress,
the variation of P-wave velocity highly relies on the concavity of the
stress-strain curve. In contrast, an increase of S-wave velocity exhibits
regardless of any constitutive model. For both P- and S-waves, the variation of
the velocities is more significant in a compressible fiber than that in a
nearly-incompressible one. Moreover, for minuscule pre-stress, we propose a
modified formula for S-wave velocity based on the Rayleigh beam theory, which
reveals the competition mechanism between ""string vibration"" and ""beam
vibration."" This may provide a reliable theoretical basis for precise
mechanical characterization of soft fibers and open a route for lightweight,

training of transformation functions, and apply a content loss and an
adversarial loss that encourages the maintenance of image identity and
photo-realism. We propose quantitative evaluation strategies for measuring
controllable editing performance, unlike prior work, which primarily focuses on

sensitivity of different system architectures to parametric variability, or to
find optimal system configurations. They can also be used at runtime, e.g., to
check if non-functional requirements are still satisfied after environmental

PMC techniques do not scale well to systems with complex behaviour and more

radiating state and a bound state is an important challenge in photonics, as
its solution promises broad technological relevance for optical sensors,
modulators, switches and displays. Existing approaches utilise the inherent

identified as bound states in the continuum (BICs), as they resemble singular
bound states embedded in a band of radiating states. Although quasi-BICs have
been demonstrated for numerous symmetric periodic photonic crystals, their
existence so far has been limited to narrow spectral ranges, and their
application in switches or modulators needs large changes of the refractive

Betweenness centrality illuminates intermittent frictional dynamics,2021-02-03T03:12:43Z,"Omid Dorostkar, Karen E. Daniels, Dominik Strebel, Jan Carmeliet","Dense granular systems subjected to an imposed shear stress undergo
stick-slip dynamics with systematic patterns of dilation-compaction. During
each stick phase, as the frictional strength builds up, the granular system
dilates to accommodate shear strain, developing stronger force networks. During
each slip event, when the stored energy is released, particles experience large
rearrangements and the granular network can significantly change. Here, we use
numerical simulations of 3D, sheared frictional packings to show that the mean
betweenness centrality -- a property of network of interparticle connections --
follows consistent patterns during the stick-slip dynamics, showing sharp
spikes at each slip event. We identify the source of this behavior as arising
from the connectivity and contact arrangements of granular network during
dilation-compaction cycles, and find that a lower potential for connection
between particles leads to an increase of mean betweenness centrality in the

logic and design engineers would find interest in this topic due to the
sophistication involved in reading-out the time. This project will do so using
by showing each decimal digit of sexagesimal time as a binary value. This
design will be primarily functioning on logic gates and would involve the use
of several basic components that include, but are not limited to, integrated
circuits (or ICs), Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and resistors.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02845v1
"An Interaction Neyman-Scott Point Process Model for Coronavirus
  Disease-19",2021-02-05T05:11:47Z,"J. Park, W. Chang, B. Choi","With rapid transmission, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to
over 2 million deaths worldwide, posing significant societal challenges.
Understanding the spatial patterns of patient visits and detecting the local
spreading events are crucial to controlling disease outbreaks. We analyze
highly detailed COVID-19 contact tracing data collected from Seoul, which
provides a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of patient visit
occurrence. Analyzing contact tracing data is challenging because patient
visits show strong clustering patterns while clusters of events may have
complex interaction behavior. To account for such behaviors, we develop a novel
interaction Neyman-Scott process that regards the observed patient visit events
as offsprings generated from a parent spreading event. Inference for such
models is complicated since the likelihood involves intractable normalizing
functions. To address this issue, we embed an auxiliary variable algorithm into
our Markov chain Monte Carlo. We fit our model to several simulated and real
data examples under different outbreak scenarios and show that our method can
describe spatial patterns of patient visits well. We also provide visualization
tools that can inform public health interventions for infectious diseases such
as social distancing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02999v1
CF-GNNExplainer: Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks,2021-02-05T17:58:14Z,"Ana Lucic, Maartje ter Hoeve, Gabriele Tolomei, Maarten de Rijke, Fabrizio Silvestri","Given the increasing promise of graph neural networks (GNNs) in real-world
applications, several methods have been developed for explaining their
predictions. Existing methods for interpreting predictions from GNNs have
primarily focused on generating subgraphs that are especially relevant for a
particular prediction. However, such methods are not counterfactual (CF) in
nature: given a prediction, we want to understand how the prediction can be
changed in order to achieve an alternative outcome. In this work, we propose a
method for generating CF explanations for GNNs: the minimal perturbation to the
input (graph) data such that the prediction changes. Using only edge deletions,
we find that our method, CF-GNNExplainer, can generate CF explanations for the
majority of instances across three widely used datasets for GNN explanations,
while removing less than 3 edges on average, with at least 94\% accuracy. This
indicates that CF-GNNExplainer primarily removes edges that are crucial for the
original predictions, resulting in minimal CF explanations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03322v4
Hydrogen Atom in the Cosmic Microwave Background,2021-02-06T02:48:44Z,Jose A. Magpantay,"The cosmic microwave background covers the entire universe, which suggests
the absence of ay closed system, except the universe itself. In this paper, I
consider the effect of the cosmic microwave background on the hydrogen atom,
which must be very small, otherwise, changes in energy levels would have been
measurable. But how small is small? This I compute by considering a system in
an environment or bath. I derived the bath's, (in this case the CMB) effect on
the hydrogen atom in the Feynman-Vernon approach to an open system. The effect
is small and quantified in terms of a correction to the hydrogen atom that
breaks time-reversal symmetry, as expected of memory effects. This is
significant. There are imperceptible changes in the state of the hydrogen atom,
which means that the pervasive CMB must have similar small effects on other
atoms, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry in all physical systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03484v1
"Jointly Improving Language Understanding and Generation with
  Quality-Weighted Weak Supervision of Automatic Labeling",2021-02-06T10:06:15Z,"Ernie Chang, Vera Demberg, Alex Marin","Neural natural language generation (NLG) and understanding (NLU) models are
data-hungry and require massive amounts of annotated data to be competitive.
Recent frameworks address this bottleneck with generative models that
synthesize weak labels at scale, where a small amount of training labels are
expert-curated and the rest of the data is automatically annotated. We follow
that approach, by automatically constructing a large-scale weakly-labeled data
with a fine-tuned GPT-2, and employ a semi-supervised framework to jointly
train the NLG and NLU models. The proposed framework adapts the parameter
updates to the models according to the estimated label-quality. On both the E2E
and Weather benchmarks, we show that this weakly supervised training paradigm
is an effective approach under low resource scenarios and outperforming
benchmark systems on both datasets when 100% of training data is used.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03551v1
"Study of $C$ parity violating and strangeness changing $J/Ï$
  ${\to}$ $PP$ weak decays",2021-02-06T13:09:13Z,"Yueling Yang, Junliang Lu, Mingfei Duan, Jinshu Huang, Junfeng Sun","The $J/{\psi}$ weak decays are rare but possible within the standard model of
elementary particles. Inspired by the potential prospects at the future
intensity frontier, the $C$ parity violating $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$
${\pi}{\eta}^{({\prime})}$, ${\eta}{\eta}^{\prime}$ decays and the strangeness
changing $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ ${\pi}K$, $K{\eta}^{({\prime})}$ decays are studied
with the perturbative QCD approach. It is found that the $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$
${\eta}{\eta}^{\prime}$ decays have relatively large branching ratios, about
the order of $10^{-11}$, which might be within the measurement capability and
sensitivity of the future STCF experiment.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03580v3
Non-gaussianities for primordial black hole formation,2021-02-06T16:51:28Z,"Marco Taoso, Alfredo Urbano","We analyze primordial non-gaussianities in presence of an ultra-slow phase
during the inflationary dynamics, focusing on scenarios relevant for the
production of primordial black holes. We compute the three-point correlation
function of comoving curvature perturbations finding that non-gaussianities are
sizable, and predominantly local. In the context of threshold statistics, we
analyze their impact for the abundance of primordial black holes, and their
interplay with the non-gaussianities arising from the non-linear relation
between density and curvature perturbations. We find that non-gaussianities
significantly modify the estimate of the primordial black holes abundance
obtained with the gaussian approximation. However, we show that this effect can
be compensated by a small change, of a factor $2\div3$ at most, of the
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations. This is
obtained with a small tuning of the parameters of the inflationary model.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03610v2
